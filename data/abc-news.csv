An image from a satellite operated by NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association showed the winter storm system near its peak as it covered the northeast around 1:45 a.m. ET on Tuesday.

The winter storm was so intense that it managed to obscure the bright lights of the big cities as the high cloud tops moved through the area.

New England was hit the hardest by the winter storm, which blanketed the area with more than 30 inches of snow in some areas."
15JlKXr,2015-01-27 00:00:00,"Russia Says 'No Evidence' of NYC Spying, Despite FBI Tapes - ABC News",http://abcnews.go.com/International/russia-evidence-nyc-spying-fbi-tapes/story?id=28518553,"Russia has rejected accusations that one of its citizens, Manhattan banker Yevgeny Buryakov, and two of its diplomats were actually spies for Russian intelligence, as alleged by the FBI following the dramatic arrest of the banker Monday.

Foreign Ministry spokesman Alexander Lukashevich said there was “no evidence” to support the charges and blamed the incident on Washington’s hostility during an “anti-Russian campaign.""

“We demand that provocations against Russian representatives started by U.S. security services stop, that consular workers have immediate access to Yevgeny Buryakov, that the rights of the Russian citizen be strictly observed and his release from custody be ordered,” Lukashevich said.

He warned Buryakov's arrest will “aggravate” U.S.-Russia relations.

The FBI, however, contends it has reams of evidence against the three men, including candid recorded conversations of some of the spies talking to each other and other alleged secret agents about operations and potential sources of information.

In one recorded conversation, the two “diplomats,” Igor Sporyshev and Victor Podobnyy, discussed the problems recruiting young females in New York City as spies.

“I have lots of ideas about such girls but these ideas are not actionable because they don’t allow [someone] to get close enough,” Sporyshev says, according to a criminal complaint unsealed Monday. “And in order to be close you either need to f*** them or use other levers to influence them to execute my requests. So when you tell me about girls, in my experience, it’s very rare that something workable will come of it.”

Sporyshev and Podobnyy were not arrested in connection with the alleged spy ring, as they no longer live in the U.S. and have diplomatic immunity. However, Buryakov was allegedly a “non-official cover” agent -– a spy who comes into a target country in the guise of a private citizen without the protection of diplomatic immunity. As described in another court document, ""in many cases [NOCs] are never identified as intelligence agents by the host government. As a result, a NOC is an extremely valuable intelligence asset for the SVR.""

The complaint also says that the SVR worked with an unnamed Russian news outlet. An official with knowledge of the case confirmed that outlet is Russia's TASS news agency, which was first reported by The Daily Beast.

Mark Stout, a former CIA analyst, said the tradecraft described in the criminal complaint seemed straight out of the Cold War.

“This is really a classic case of espionage, I think, in terms of how it was conducted both on the Russian side as well as on the FBI side,” Stout told ABC News Monday. “The FBI is very good at this. I would not run up against the FBI trying to run an espionage operation in the United States.”"

Researchers at University of Washington and a nonprofit called Group Health followed 3,434 adults over age 65 for more than seven years. None of them had dementia or Alzheimer's disease when the study started, and they kept careful records about the drugs they took. The researchers found that people who took more anticholinergic drugs -- which affect the nervous system and are in antihistamines and some bladder control medications -- were more likely to develop dementia.

The link has been studied before but this is an especially good study, said Dr. James Leverenz, a neurologist who directs the Cleveland Center for Brain Health at the Cleveland Clinic and was not party of the new study.

""People want to be very careful about what kind of medicines they taking or if they already have some issues with their thinking skills,"" Leverenz said. ""I knew when I first start taking [antihistamines] for allergies, I feel a little clouded and sleepy. Some of that is the anticholinergic effect in the brain.""

Still, he stressed the researchers only found an association between the drugs and dementia and did not determine whether the drugs caused dementia. More research is needed, he said, adding that some antihistamine products have fewer effects on the cholinergic system of the brain, which is involved in thinking skills and memory. He said this link between dementia and these drugs has not been studied in younger adults.

""Consult with your primary clinician if you have questions,"" he said. ""Carefully read the contents of medications you take over the counter."""

Here are some fun facts about the Big Game to chew on before kickoff.

-- The Seahawks and Patriots are both the No. 1 seed in their respective conferences.

-- The Seahawks are the first team to play in consecutive Super Bowls since the Patriots did it in 2004-05.

-- This is the 2nd time the University of Phoenix Stadium has held the Super Bowl. The stadium previously hosted Super Bowl XLII in 2008. The New York Giants defeated the Patriots 17-14 in what many regard as one of the best title games ever played and one of the NFL's biggest upsets. The Giants' win ended the Patriots perfect season that year.

-- The 2015 Pro Bowl on Jan. 25, 2015 was held at the University of Phoenix Stadium. It's the first Pro Bowl to be held at a Super Bowl site since 2010.

-- Which college is the best represented at this year's Super Bowl? The University of Wisconsin has the most with six players: James White and Jonathan Casillas of the Patriots and O'Brien Schofield, Russell Wilson, David Gilreath and Mike Taylor of the Seahawks.

-- The winning team will get to hoist the coveted Vince Lombardi Trophy, named after the legendary Green Bay Packers head coach and Brooklyn-native.

The sterling silver trophy is made by Tiffany & Co. and weighs about seven pounds.

-- Speaking of the Lombardi Trophy, the Pittsburgh Steelers have the most with six. The San Francisco 49ers and the Dallas Cowboys are tied for second with five each.

-- Other than Tom Brady's performance, the other most scrutinized aspect of the Super Bowl will be the commercials. A 30-second spot is estimated to cost between $4-4.5 million. For the first Super Bowl in 1967, the average cost of a 30-second ad was between $37,500 to $42,500.

-- Super Bowl XLVIII, which saw Seattle crush the Denver Broncos 43-8, was the most-watched Super Bowl of all time with 111.5 million viewers, according to Nielsen.

It also stands as the most-watched TV program is U.S. history.

-- The first Super Bowl in 1967 between the Green Bay Packers and the Kansas City Chiefs was watched by 51.1 million people, according to Nielsen. However, it was the only Super Bowl to be televised on two networks (CBS and NBC) simultaneously.

-- A ticket to any Super Bowl is arguably the most sought-after ticket in sports, but that wasn't always the case. The attendance for Super Bowl I was 61,946, but the seating capacity at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum was more than 94,000 at the time.

-- If winning the Super Bowl was not enough motivation, players on the winning team get paid $97,000.

And yes, even Super Bowl losers get a little extra cash with players on the losing team taking home $49,000.

15P0Qaz,2015-01-27 00:00:00,ISIS Hostage Says He'll Be Killed Within 24 Hours - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/International/isis-hostage-hell-killed-24-hours/story?id=28514138,"In a chilling new video from the terror group ISIS, the Japanese journalist held hostage allegedly says that he and another captive have been given 24 hours or less to live unless a convicted terrorist is freed from prison.

The new video uploaded online early Tuesday, shows a still image of journalist Kenji Goto and plays audio, purportedly of Goto’s voice, as he says he has been told it is his ""last message"" and that ""time is running very short.""

""It is me for her,"" he says, referring to Sajida al-Rishawi, a female would-be suicide bomber who confessed to her role in a string of deadly al Qaeda attacks in Jordan in 2005. She has been on death row in Jordan ever since. In a previous video, ISIS first made the demand for al-Rishawi's release.

The voice attributed to Goto says first ISIS will kill a Jordanian pilot they've been holding captive, and then himself if the terrorists' demands aren't met. In the still image, Goto holds another photo of a man who resembles the Jordanian pilot.

Goto’s mother, Junko Ishido, told a Japanese news outlet the voice was her son’s.

“We don’t have much time left,” she said, according to a translation by NHK. “It is extremely urgent. I want the government to do whatever it takes.”

A spokesperson for the White House National Security Council told ABC News officials are aware of the video but declined to comment further. The video has not been officially authenticated, but top U.S. and foreign officials treated the previous video, which also appeared to show the body of a murdered Japanese hostage, as authentic.

After the video emerged, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said he “talked by telephone with leaders of countries concerned and asked them for any possible support to collect intelligence and get the hostage freed as soon as possible.”

“The situation is extremely difficult, but we will work with other nations extremely closely and do whatever we can to secure an early release,” he said."

A travel ban was lifted at midnight in Massachusetts, but authorities are urging drivers to stay off the roads as cleanup efforts continue.

Public transportation service from the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority is slated to resume today. Airlines were expected to begin flying at Boston's Logan Airport this morning and to have full schedules back in place by Thursday, according to an airport official.

Strong winds and coastal flooding were reported from the coastline of Long Island, New York, to Massachusetts. Wind gusts reached 60-75 mph during the storm.

The storm punched out a 40-to-50-foot section of a seawall in Marshfield, Massachusetts, badly damaging a vacant home. In Newport, Rhode Island, it toppled a 110-foot replica of a Revolutionary War sailing vessel in dry dock, breaking its mast and puncturing its hull.

The storm's heaviest snow bands stayed north and east of New York City, leaving the nation's biggest metropolis at the lower end of the snow forecast. Snowfall at LaGuardia Airport, in the relatively heavy-hit eastern New York borough of Queens, stood at 11 inches.

Fearing the worst late Monday, officials shut down mass transit systems from New York City to Boston, and closed roads to traffic in all or parts of five states. Thousands of flights were canceled because of the storm.

In all, seven states -- including Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Rhode Island and New Hampshire -- declared states of emergency.

On Tuesday, after a huge snowfall failed to materialize in some cases, officials in some Northeast cities and states lifted the travel bans and defended their decision to impose them in the first place.

""My job as a leader is to make decisions, and I will always err on the side of safety or caution,"" New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said. ""To me, it was a no-brainer. We have to take precautions to keep people safe.""

Hours after Brown, 21, was rushed to North Fulton Hospital, police and hospital officials declined to give any details about her condition, other than to confirm that she was alive.

Brown's husband, Nick Gordon, and a friend found her face down in a tub in the home in the Ellard subdivision and started CPR, police said.

""Can't say how sad this is,"" Roswell Police Department spokeswoman Lisa Holland said. ""It's a difficult situation for police officer to perform CPR on any person. ""

Officers were still at the home where Brown was found late Saturday, investigating the incident, police said.

Whitney Houston, Brown's mother, Brown's mother, was found unresponsive in a tub and died nearly three years ago in California.

Brown, who starred in the 2012 reality show ""The Houstons: On Our Own"" following the death of her iconic mother at 48, has been very vocal about her career aspirations and following in her mother's footsteps.

""Let's start this career up&&moving OUT to TO YOU ALLLL quick shall we !?!???!"" she tweeted on Thursday.

Let's start this career up&&moving OUT to TO YOU ALLLL quick shall we !?!???! ????????????????????????????????????????????????????????!!!!!!!

Also, last March, Brown tweeted to her more than 140,000 fans on Twitter that she has a voice just like her mother's.

""Think about it.. She had 1babygirl, lungs and a GORGEOUS unforgettable voice .. Who do you think ONLY has HER vocal chords.. ?"" she posted.

Brown was also in the spotlight for other reasons. In early 2013, she revealed that she had married Nick Gordon, a young man that her mother had taken in years before. Brown fired back at people who criticized this move and their relationship.

""I'm tired of hearing people say, 'Eww you're engaged to your brother or if Whitney was still alive would we be together or would she approve of this.' Let me clear up something. We aren't even real brother and sister, nor is he my adoptive brother,"" she wrote on Facebook before tying the knot."

Internet giant GoDaddy released its Super Bowl ad online today, then said it won't be using it, after howls of discontent from dog advocates over the spot, which featured NASCAR's Danica Patrick and a golden retriever.

In the 30-second ad, a golden retriever puppy falls out of a truck but finds its way home. Unfortunately for the pooch, its owner went on GoDaddy.com to make a website to sell the dog, AdWeek reported

Animal lovers didn't get the joke, though. They pointed out that dogs sold often come from puppy mills and set up the hashtag #GoDaddyPuppy to rally critics. A Change.org petition opposing the ad gained 42,000 signatures.

GoDaddy CEO Blake Irving went on Twitter to say ""we will not air"" the ad.

Loud and clear, we heard you. @Blakei on changing course with this year's Super Bowl Ad: https://t.co/gzduFypdEi

But don't worry about the dog.

While shooting the Super Bowl commercial with Patrick, GoDaddy employees fell in love with the pup, later named Buddy by GoDaddy followers on social media, and the company adopted it.

""As our Chief Companion Officer, Buddy will be interacting with customers, mostly small business owners who are looking for relaxation and a reprieve from their hectic workday,"" GoDaddy Chief Marketing Officer Barb Rechterman said in a news release. ""We're already booking time with customers ... and our own employees are lining up to meet the little guy. All you have to do is look at him and 'bam,' your stress level goes down and your mood goes up.""

Swift has filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to trademark that phrase -- a lyric from her hit song “Shake It Off” -- and a number of others related to her latest album, 1989.

Some of the other phrases include ""Party Like It's 1989,"" ""'Cause We Never Go Out of Style"" -- that's a line from her current single, ""Style"" -- plus ""Nice to Meet You. Where You Been?"" and ""Could Show You Incredible Things,"" which are both lines from her #1 hit ""Blank Space.""

While it may seem silly, it’s actually a savvy business move for the pop star. Swift is seeking to prevent the phrases from being used on merchandise without her permission, ensuring she’s the only one who can profit from them.

If the trademarks are granted, they will give Swift the exclusive right to have the words printed on all kinds of products, from T-shirts and stationery, to drumsticks, cell phone cases and, yes, ""battery-activated glow bracelets."""
162lKls,2015-01-30 00:00:00,John Kerry Ticketed For Failing to Shovel Boston Residence Sidewalk - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/john-kerry-ticketed-failing-shovel-boston-residence-sidewalk/story?id=28605894,"He’s been a soldier, an attorney, a lawmaker, a presidential candidate and he’s now the head of the U.S. State Department. But that doesn’t mean John Kerry doesn’t have to follow the rules like the rest of us.

According to a complaint on Boston’s Citizens Connect website, Kerry apparently neglected to shovel snow off the sidewalk of his Boston residence following the massive Northeast blizzard earlier this week.

To be fair, Kerry was not in the United States when the white stuff rolled over Boston.

On Tuesday, he was attending the president’s delegation to pay respects to deceased Saudi King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, and immediately upon his return had to attend Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel’s farewell ceremony in Virginia.

Kerry spokesman Glen Johnson emailed a statement over the incident to ABC News saying, ""Diplomats -- they're just like us.""

Johnson said Kerry's neighborhood association hires a contractor who did, in fact, shovel after the storm.

But the contractor apparently failed to shovel one of Kerry’s sidewalks because someone had strung along caution tape to warn pedestrians of falling snow and ice from the roof.

Johnson said the contractor apparently thought it meant the sidewalk was off limits.

The ordeal cost Kerry a whopping $50, which Johnson said Kerry will ""gladly pay.""

However, Boston is forecasted to experience even more snowfall this weekend, so there may be more shoveling ahead.

It’s not the first complaint submitted for the Kerry residence on the Citizens Connect website. Dating back to April of last year, one resident complained that the police guarding the Kerry residence sit in their car with the engine running.

“It's nice and cool out,” the complaint reads. “There's absolutely no need for air conditioning.”"

The student at Bard College in Dutchess County took Amtrak train #283 from Penn Station to Albany, according to state health officials. He got off in Rhinecliff, N.Y.

He has been isolated during his recovery, said officials with the college.

""In order to prevent the spread of illness, DOH is advising individuals who may have been exposed and who have symptoms consistent with measles to call their health care providers or a local emergency room BEFORE going for care. This will help to prevent others at these facilities from being exposed to the illness,"" said a statement from the New York State Department of Health.

At Bard College, the Dutchess County Department of Health held a measles vaccination clinic for any students, faculty, or staff who have not been vaccinated against measles. New York has had three cases of measles this year, the department said, one in Dutchess County and two in New York City.

New York requires that all college students show proof of immunity to measles. At Bard College, medical forms show that a student's immunity to the disease must be documented, but they don't state whether exemptions are allowed.

The current nationwide outbreak of measles has spread to 14 states and includes 84 cases reported this month.

Measles is one of the most contagious viruses in existence and will infect an estimated 90 percent of people who not immune to the virus. The incubation period is on average 14 days, but an infected person can be contagious up to four days before they start to show symptoms.

Lifeguards at the New York City Triathlon noticed that he stopped swimming in the dark waters of the Hudson River, and pulled his body onto a surfboard.

The fact that he woke up five days later and is alive today is a ""miracle,"" he said. A series of miracles, really.

""I'm on borrowed time,"" LaPak, 53, told ABC News. ""My heart stopped, and it remained stopped anywhere between 11 and 13 minutes.""

LaPak's heart stopped in the water at around 7 a.m. that morning, but his heart attack actually happened days earlier, causing him to have an irregular heartbeat, doctors later told him. He thinks it happened during a hot yoga class because he remembers terrible chest pain and shortness of breath, he said. But he ignored it.

Both his parents died of heart attacks in their 50s, but LaPak was a self-described ""workout maniac.""

""I work out so much,"" he said. ""I think subconsciously I thought could beat this whole thing.""

According to the American Heart Association, 359,400 people went into cardiac arrest outside of a hospital in 2013. The survival rate is 9.5 percent. Heart disease is the number 1 cause of death in the United States, claiming 787,000 lives in 2011.

A lifelong athlete, LaPak had run three marathons and trained with an Olympic swim coach for six months before the triathlon on Aug. 3 -- an Olympic-length triathlon consisting of a 1.5 kilometer swim, 40K bike ride and 10K run. He said he remembers very little about the events leading up to his cardiac arrest. He recalled snippets of getting ready for the race the night before, but the next thing he knew, he was waking up in the hospital five days later.

Lifeguards on surfboards spotted his body in the water and pulled him onto a surfboard, taking care to keep his head above water. They took him to a jet ski and then a fire department boat before making it to the dock, an ambulance, Roosevelt Hospital and, finally, Mount Sinai St. Luke's Hospital.

There, doctors learned that his left anterior descending artery was 100 percent blocked, but realized they needed to save his brain before they could fix it.

Dr. Eyal Herzog happened to be at work that Sunday, and followed protocols to cool LaPak down to 33 degrees Celsius, or 94.1 degrees Fahrenheit, to protect his brain and give it a chance to recover. They cooled him quickly and then warmed him back up slowly over about 16 hours. Five days after the attack, LaPak opened his eyes, and Herzog asked him simple questions. Could he read a clock and tell him what time it was? Did he know the names of his family members in the room.

""Everyone was in shock,"" LaPak said. ""My family and friends had been told there was a less than 10 percent chance I was going to live. And if I did, there was a 95 percent chance I'd be brain dead.""

He underwent a double bybass surgery and is now back to running 10 or 12 miles several times a week, he said. When he reunited with the team of people who saved him several months later, he learned that no one whose heart has stopped in the Hudson River has ever survived.

He said he'll always have a bond with the people who saved him.

""They never gave up,"" LaPak said, adding that the experience has taught him to slow down and savor his life a little more. ""They never quit on me. They gave me an opportunity to have more life and to see my two kids get married and have kids."""
165TIql,2015-02-01 00:00:00,Super Bowl: Chris Pratt vs. Chris Evans -- Meet the Children of Seattle Children's Hospital and Christopher's Haven - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/super-bowl-chris-pratt-chris-evans-meet-children/story?id=28586838,"Dane Bowman-Weston loves comic books, is a huge Seattle Seahawks fan and also a 13-year-old cancer patient at Seattle Children's Hospital.

For this brave young man, nothing meant more than when two A-list actors -- Chris Pratt and Chris Evans -- decided to lay down a little Super Bowl XLIX bet to benefit children just like Dane.

""I'm just really excited,"" Bowman-Weston told ABC News about the big game.

It all started less than two weeks ago when the ""Captain America"" star, who is a New England Patriots fan, reached out to the ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" star, a loyal Seahawks supporter, and made a joke.

""Well, well, well @prattprattpratt, looks like our teams are going into battle. For the next 2 weeks, you are not my friend, you are my enemy,"" Evans, 33, wrote.

Pratt, 35, eventually came back with a great idea.

@ChrisEvans OK. Seahawks win you fly yourself to Seattle, visit @seattlechildren hospital as Captain America, waving the 12th man flag.

Evans countered with his own favorite place for children battling cancer, Christopher's Haven.

For Bowman-Weston, he couldn't be more excited for a possible Seahawks victory, which would mean he gets to meet Captain America, aka Evans.

""It would be really special,"" he added. ""I like all of the Avengers, but my favorites are Iron Man and Captain America. ... That would be cool if I could hold Captain America's shield.""

For someone like Dane -- who found out this past June, on his father's birthday no less, that he had osteosarcoma -- this bet is a breath of fresh air during a tough time. Bowman-Weston's knee had been hurting, so he went in for an MRI, where they found the tumor.

Dane's story is all too familiar for Seattle Children's Hospital President Lisa Brandenburg, who said ""when celebrities, football players and super heroes come visit, there's nothing better that they could do for these kids.""

""Already, the excitement here is at a fever pitch, there's Seahawks-mania here,"" she said. ""Russell Wilson [the Seahawks' star quarterback] often comes on Tuesdays and the other players come, as well. This just adds to it. Now they are thinking, 'Great maybe I'm also going to see Captain America, maybe Star-Lord [aka Pratt] will show up!'""

“@CNRTOW: See what you started @prattprattpratt ?? pic.twitter.com/thCuvs55eR” @ChrisEvans

Seattle Children's has almost 60 pediatric subspecialties and has been serving the Seattle community for more than 100 years. Its research center is also widely recognized for its work in cancer, genetics, pathology and infectious disease.

""This is a challenging time for these kids. So, to have something to look forward to, have something that makes them feel special,"" she said. ""Hoping they get a visit, it's huge for them. It gives them hope.""

Brandenburg said celebrities generous with their time really do have an effect.

""It takes their mind off their problems for a little bit of time and that's what they need,"" she said.

Another patient, Kennedy O’Day, 8, got together with other children in the same unit. Here's the challenge they put out if the Seahawks win:

They want Evans ""dressed in a full Seahawk’s uniform and have him do the Seahawks chant with them."" They also want to see him sing “Stronger” by Kelly Clarkson.

Christopher's Haven's mission is unique and special. The organization is a place for families traveling far from home to get help for their children. The Haven website says its facility is a ""respite from hospital bed"" and space so parents can be with their kids.

Joyce Duvall, executive director for the organization in Boston, found out about the bet when her organization's website crashed because of all the traffic that Evans and Pratt had brought.

Duvall said after Evans and Pratt tweeted out their challenge, employees couldn't get to the phones fast enough. The social media team couldn't keep up with the tweets and the site eventually went down. A great problem to have for an organization that helps so many families.

""They told me about the best and I said, 'Holy cow!'"" she said. ""Right after that, I got a text from Chris Evans, saying, 'Just wanted to let you know about this little thing I did.' I said, 'No kidding Chris, our website crashed!'""

Duvall said back in January that they got 11,000 tweets when Evans, who actually went to school with her children and has known Duvall for years, did an event with them. This Super Bowl bet got them 200,000.

""It's so refreshing! The kids' reaction has been almost disbelief. They can't wrap their heads around it. They go, 'Is he talking about us?'"" she said. ""I said, 'Yes!'""

The kids at Christopher's change every 6 to 8 weeks, so Duvall said alumni have been calling and obviously, they are excited!

Evans is no stranger to connecting with and helping the children of Christopher's. One story, in particular, really struck Duvall.

A 4-year-old boy Coleman wanted a superhero costume for his cancer treatment, thinking ""Superheros can go through anything."" He ended up wearing his outfit the entire time he was getting treatment.

""Then Chris showed up and said, 'This guy is the real superhero,'"" she added, tearing up a bit.

hey @prattprattpratt ..... pic.twitter.com/ceDXefR8TG

So, what are the official rules of this little Super Bowl bet?

If the Patriots win Super Bowl XLIX, Chris Pratt will visit Christopher’s Haven as Star-Lord and wear a Tom Brady jersey. If the Seahawks win, Chris Evans has to visit Seattle Children’s Hospital to wave Seattle’s 12th Man Flag in his Captain American outfit.

As of now, the stakes got a little higher with ""Twitterbowl 2015.""

""Fans will compete to raise the most money for either Seattle Children’s Hospital or Christopher’s Haven,"" a joint release to ABC News read.

Fans can donate to Seattle Children’s HERE and to Christopher’s Haven HERE.

The idea is to have a tally running from today until one of the heroes visits the winner's charity of choice."

The 21-year-old Brown was hospitalized over the weekend after being found unresponsive in a bathtub.

“Bobbi Kristina is fighting for her life and is surrounded by immediate family,"" the Houston family said in a statement. ""As her father already stated, we are asking you to honor our request for privacy during this difficult time. Thank you for your prayers, well wishes, and we greatly appreciate your continued support.""

Brown, the daughter of Bobby Brown and the late Houston, was rushed to an Atlanta-area hospital after her husband, Nick Gordon, and a friend found her face down in a tub. Police arrived at the home at 10:25 a.m. and took over life-saving measures until rescue personnel arrived.

""Can't say how sad this is,"" Roswell Police Department spokeswoman Lisa Holland said. ""It's a difficult situation for a police officer to perform CPR on any person.""

Brown lost her mother almost exactly three years ago in a similar fashion. Houston was found unresponsive in a tub in Beverly Hills and died shortly thereafter."

UVA Police received the information of the alleged assault Thursday, though the assault was said to have occurred six days earlier. This was the same weekend that sorority members were ordered to stay in their houses and not participate in fraternity activities for the weekend.

“On February 5, 2015, The University of Virginia Police Department received information from the Office of the Dean of Students about a sexual assault incident reported to have occurred on January 30, 2015, in a residence hall on-Grounds,” Chief of University Police Michael Gibson, said in an email to students last night.

“This information is being released in accordance with the federal Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act. The Clery Act requires all colleges and universities that participate in federal financial aid programs to keep and disclose information about crime on and near their respective campuses, including timely warnings of crimes that may represent a serious or ongoing threat to the safety of students or employees.”

The University of Virginia has faced pressure to change the way they handle sexual assault on campus in the past few months after a now-discredited story in the Rolling Stone detailing a culture of rape and sexual violence at a fraternity house.

Virginia state lawmakers are weighing legislation that would require university employees to report any sexual assault to law enforcement. HB1930 is advancing in the House of Delegates and is sponsored by Delegate Robert Bell, a Republican from Albemarle. Some worry that this legislation could discourage victims from reporting.

University of Virginia Deputy Spokesperson Matthew Charles gave ABC News the following statement on the January 30 incident:
""The University of Virginia Police Department issued a timely warning notice pursuant to the Clery Act on Thursday evening related to information it received regarding a reported sexual assault incident on Jan. 30 at a residence hall.
The matter is being reviewed in accordance with Title IX, the Clery Act, the 2013 Violence Against Women Act, and university policies, and no further comments are anticipated at this time.""

The college has taken a number of steps aimed at improving campus safety including posting monitors at frat parties and forbidding beer kegs and mixed drinks."

More than 50 jackrabbits the size of small dogs have been hopping around backyards and a park of a new development in South Fargo, resident Kayla Straabe told ABC News today.

""Every day, I feel like the crazy rabbit lady chasing them out of the yard where they're having a hay day,"" Straabe said. ""There's at least 40 to 50 everyday, and they're in our yards and by a children's park.""

She said the city pest control department told her that they couldn't do anything about the jackrabbits, technically wild hares, because they were wild animals.

""I was told we should poison them, which I will absolutely not do,"" Straabe said.

There is no city ordinance that deals with depopulating rabbits in the area, Fargo Police Lt. Joel Vettel told ABC News.

""I can't imagine someone would suggest poisoning the rabbits, but it's true we don't have anything in place to allow us to deal with the rabbits,"" Vettel said. ""What residents can do is start a formal process to get an ordinance, which is usually done at committee meetings.""

Straabe said the critters were cute at first when a few appeared about two to three months ago. But now, they're frustrating, she said, noting they've multiplied and that they are now leaving their droppings everywhere and devouring trees and shrubs.

Female jackrabbits can bear two to four litters each year with one to nine offspring in each litter, according to the Northern Prairie Wildlife Research Center."

It opened last week in Los Angeles.

The Women's Mosque was hosted in a modest, multifaith worship center, where Muslim women and women of other faiths joined together for a Jumu'ah, a congregational prayer Muslims hold every Friday, and a Khutbah, a public sermon.

""Oh, my God, it was so amazing,"" founder M. Hasna Maznavi told ABC News today. ""As you know, when it rains in L.A., no one comes out. But people came out in droves. It was estimated that around 150 people attended.""

And unlike most U.S. mosques that have a male imam, or leader, a woman led the traditional prayer and gave the sermon.

Being part of the historic experience was invigorating and terrifying at the same time, Edina Lekovic, who led last Friday's debut event, told ABC News today. Lekovic is also a public affairs consultant for the Muslim Public Affairs Council.

""Being surrounded by women in an environment created for women created a special spiritual charge I won't ever forget,"" Lekovic said. ""One of my friends said she couldn't stop her tears through the whole thing.""

The Women's Mosque came out of a group of Muslim women's growing disillusionment with many U.S. mosques and Maznavi's childhood dream of starting her own mosque.

Many mosques segregate women or bar them completely, Hind Makki told ABC News. Makki runs Side Entrance, a Tumblr blog that collects photos of Muslim women's spaces of worship, which are more often than not in poorer condition than men's, she said.

""I posted a picture on Facebook of one women's room for prayer in a Chicago mosque I visited, which was only 8 feet by 20 feet,"" Makki said. ""While many girls commented, 'Yup, that's typical,' a lot of my guy friends were so surprised and wanted to help change this.""

The Koran and the Prophet Muhammad never said women should be separated, Maznavi said. Indeed, there is a lost history of thousands of female authority figures and scholars in Islam such as the prophet's wife Aisha, she added.

Maznavi became interested in Islam and women's role after 9/11 when she read the Koran cover to cover in English as a young girl, she said. She was surprised to see a merciful, loving and just God, and discovered that what was going on in mosques she visited was not a reflection of the actual teachings of the Prophet Muhammad, she added.

Other women said they felt the same as Maznavi, such as Sana Muttalib, an attorney and co-president of the Women's Mosque. Together, these women helped to make the Women's Mosque happen.

They say the space isn't meant as an alternative to local mosques but as a complementary place where women can begin to feel empowered.

""Our mosque has a healthy, great relationship with men,"" Maznavi said. ""Many are supportive of our idea that we want women to first become empowered and comfortable in our safe space so that they can go back and transform their own communities and local mosques.""

The spiritual leader for the Islamic Center of America, the largest mosque in the U.S., said he supports the women at the Women's Mosque. At the Islamic Center of America, men and women can pray in the same space though men are in the front and women are in the back.

""I believe this is one way female Muslims can express their Islamic identity while being proud to be women who have equal rights to men in our religion,"" Imam Hassan Qazwini told ABC News. ""I think it’s a bold and courageous step, and ultimately, I think they should be respected by all Muslims.""

The Women's Mosque plans to add other events and classes that men can join, but they are keeping their worship and prayer sessions exclusively for women, Maznavi said.

The nondenominational mosque welcomes women of any faith who may be curious to learn about Islam and encourages visitors to come as they are, she said. You don't have to come dressed a certain way or anything like that, she added.

The Women's Mosque is planning to hold a Jummu'ah and sermon one Friday a month at the multifaith Pico Union Project building, but it said it plans to expand to other spaces to reach as many people as possible more often. They rely on donations to fund their house of worship.

""I want to garner the untapped potential of Muslim women not only for the Muslim community, but to empower all women of the world,"" Maznavi said. ""God does not change the condition of people until people change themselves."""

A group of bipartisan senators proposed legislation last week that would end the travel ban between the U.S. and Cuba, and today a subcommittee of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee chaired by senator and son of Cuban immigrants, Marco Rubio, R-Fla., will hold a hearing on how the new policy changes might impact human rights and democracy on the island.

“There’s obviously a desire by the big airlines, Kayak, Orbitz the others—travel institutions to get more involved, but still a lot of red tape,” Collin Laverty, President and Owner of Cuba Educational Travel told ABC News. “There is still some reporting and some oversight which stifles what could actually happen.”

President Obama’s December announcement of easing restrictions meant if you fell into one of the previously approved groups traveling to Cuba—business, journalism, or cultural exchange, for example, you could now go much easier.

But with that executive order visitors still have to qualify for one of the twelve groups, and travel is restricted from “tourism” meaning no sun and sand vacations.

“One significant change would be under the current regulation you can’t really do—sun and sand tourism. You can’t just go to the beach,” Laverty said. “Cuba does have a lot of hotels in Varadero, Santa Maria Key, Cayo Coco, beach locations.”

“If the travel ban were lifted altogether that’d make it really, really clear there are no restrictions—all the big players would move really quickly to start offering Cuba travel,” Laverty said. “That would be transformational.”

Major players like MasterCard and American Express have already announced they would begin allowing their cards to be used in Cuba, and Kayak said travelers can now search hotel and flight information.

“We have seen significant interest in travel to Cuba,” said Steve Hafner, chief executive officer and co-founder, KAYAK said in a press release. “Our goal is to provide comprehensive information for travelers – whether they are planning a trip to Cuba or anywhere else in the world.”

While travelers can now search for Cuba there are still no booking links available showing the red tape still blocking way to free travel.

With the legislation introduced to Congress—if passed, would mean anyone, at any time, and for any reason could visit Cuba just like any other destination in the world.

“You’d still have to get a Visa from Cuba, so I think they would analyze..what’s our infrastructure and how many people can we handle… they would do an assessment in terms of capacity,” Laverty said, adding visa travel limits are normal for many countries, including Costa Rica, which limits the amount of landing permits issued to airlines.

Tom Popper, President of InsightCuba and one of the first to send America groups to Cuba under the people-to-people tours tells ABC News tourism has been developing around the peninsula part of the island for many years.

“If you keep going east along the northern coast, Varadero, there is space there,” Popper told ABC News, explaining that while it is currently not the destination for Americans due to restriction, once opened people would head to the beaches and “those destinations would be open and ready to receive American tourists.”

“Certainly paying hotel rooms and taxes and landing fees, and certainly revenue from that goes to government, but when you have Americans go into a city, go to bar, go to restaurant, somebody selling a craft on street, there’s an opportunity for people to improve their economic situation,” Popper said."

In a question-and-answer session Monday at the Bipartisan Policy Center, Sen. Thom Tillis, R-North Carolina, argued that restaurants should be allowed to “opt out” of certain regulations - such as employees washing their hands. Such a rule, he says, is an example of how America is “one of the most regulated nations in the history of the planet.”

According to Roll Call, the senator was recalling a time in 2010 when he had a chat with a woman on Starbucks’ health regulations.

“I said that I don’t have any problem with Starbucks if they choose to opt out of this policy as long as they post a sign that says, ‘We don’t require our employees to wash their hands after leaving the restroom.’ The market will take care of that,” Tillis said.

“If you let a business or industry opt out as long as they indicate through proper disclosure, through advertising, through employee literature, there’s this level of regulations that maybe they’re on the books,” Tillis said. “But maybe you can make a market based decision as to whether or not they should apply to you.”

The Republican senator from North Carolina went on to say that a move like that by a restaurant would probably result in it going out of business.

At the end of the discussion, Bipartisan Policy Center President Jason Grumet joked to Tillis, “I’m not sure if I’m going to shake your hand,” MSNBC reports.

In an interview with The Huffington Post Tuesday at the Capitol, Tillis denied making those remarks. ""I didn't say that,"" Tillis said. ""I think I had a blogger follow that was without a sense of humor. Obviously, I think that's important.""

But he also defended his position in an interview with the Associated Press the same day, ""Sometimes there are regulations that maybe we want to set a direction, but then let those who are regulated decide whether or not it makes sense.""

Tillis' remarks come during a week when health issues, like child vaccinations, are being debated by politicians and the public."

Among the Alabamans affected today were Joe Baker and Russell Wilson, who said their excitement turned to disappointment as they headed to the Mobile, Alabama, courthouse to get a marriage license and found the office window closed.

""We thought the windows were going to open at 8 [a.m.],"" Baker said. ""They just [kept] delaying it and delaying it.""

Instead of signing marriage licenses, Baker and Wilson gathered with several other same-sex couples today in a law office to file new petitions.

""No windows open. No marriage license,"" Wilson said. ""We waited 33 years for this. ... It's a big disappointment.""

It was a chaotic day for same-sex couples as a U.S. Supreme Court decision made Alabama the 37th state today to allow same-sex marriages. On Sunday night, a state chief justice ordered county judges to deny the licenses and today Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley said he was ""disappointed"" in a federal appeals court's decision to allow the unions but would not take action against judges who issued licenses.

While some gay Alabamans were able to get marriage licenses, others had less to celebrate. At least 51 counties had refused to issue marriage licenses today, according to the ABC News count.

The turmoil was set in motion last Tuesday when a federal appeals court ruled against delaying the overturning of Alabama's gay-marriage bans, with U.S. District Judge Callie Granade calling it unconstitutional.

State Attorney General Luther Strange then asked the U.S. Supreme Court for a stay on the marriages until the high court took up the nationwide issue in the spring.

Then, on Sunday night, Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore, a vocal opponent of gay marriage, ordered county probate judges to refuse marriage licenses to gay couples today, despite Granade's having ruled that probate judges had a legal duty to issue the licenses.

Moore reportedly called homosexuality an ""evil"" in a 2002 custody ruling. Today, he told ABC News that gay marriage is wrong and that only he had the authority over judges who issue marriage licenses.

""I think redefinition of the word 'marriage' is not found within the powers designated in the federal government,"" he said. ""Do they stop with one man and one man or one woman and one woman? ... Or do they go to multiple marriages or marriages between men and their daughters or women and their sons?""

This morning, however, the U.S. Supreme Court opted not to halt today's start of the issuance of same-sex marriage licenses. Moore said the Supreme Court would decide on the matter but until then, he'd fight against gay marriage.

Many judges started granting marriage licenses today and critics blasted Moore for ordering county judges to go against a federal judge. Some state judges said they wanted further information from the courts before they permitted marriage licenses.

The National Organization for Marriage backs the state chief justice and any probate judges who are defying the Supreme Court today. The group says it encourages ""Alabama officials to refuse to comply"" with the federal court decision.

But Susan Watson, the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Alabama, called the Alabama chief justice's actions ""grandstanding.""

She said his order had no authority over probate court judges and that they risked being sued if they followed his order. ""I didn't know how long it would take for [same-sex marriage] to happen here,"" Watson said.

Watson said the ACLU of Alabama had received more than 40 complaints so far from couples who had been turned away. She said the next step for Alabama would be potential legal action to get all the state courts on the same page regarding same-sex marriage licenses.

Moore said today the US Supreme Court would decide on the matter but until then, he'd fight against gay marriage.

""I'd love to [give Malcolm the truck],"" Brady said on Boston sports radio station WEEI. ""We're going to figure out how to make that happen.""

Butler, 24, was a cashier at a Popeyes restaurant in Mississippi in 2008.

What an amazing few days. Tired but enjoying the ride. Thanks for giving me a chance @Patriots So #blessed.

""It's an incredible play, and not only that, that's the type of plays Malcolm makes for our team,"" Brady said, according to ESPN. ""A guy like Malcolm who makes that type of quick, instinctive plays, that's one of his strong suits. I don't think it surprised any of us players because that's what his skill set is.""

What may be Butler's new truck was also the same model that was awkwardly presented to San Francisco Giants pitcher and World Series MVP Madison Bumgarner back in Oct. 2014.

Chevrolet, meanwhile, said it has ""no issues"" with Brady giving his truck to Butler.

On permanent exhibition beginning Tuesday at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, the solarium blends the sights and sounds of the sun to create a one-of-a-kind experience -- minus those incinerating temperatures.

Pulling from the resources of NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory, the installation has incredible imagery that includes erupting solar flares, the yellow-orange swirls of the solar atmosphere and unexpected explosions of solar matter that can be up to 50 times larger than earth.

Genna Duberstein, lead producer on the project, told ABC News it took four years to bring the idea to life. She said stepping inside has a ""time-bending, mind-numbing property to it.""

""It kind of makes you have to forget about your phone and your to-do list and you just stop and observe and it really brings you into the moment,"" she said. ""You see flickers of light and dark shapes and you lose all sense of time.""

The Solar Dynamics Observatory captures the incredible action of the sun using the ones and zeroes of binary code, according to NASA. The code is then processed into black and white photos, which are later colorized by scientists to provide a more realistic look at the solar activity."

The plane, which was carrying 58 people, clipped a bridge shortly after Wednesday’s takeoff from Taipei's downtown Sungshan Airport, state media said. A search is ongoing for 12 of the passengers.

The plane was visible from Taiwan’s busy National Freeway No. 1 just seconds before the crash.

The plane could be seen veering sharply, with the wing striking a vehicle and barrier on the plane's descent.

Parts of the wrecked fuselage of the turboprop ATR 72 jutted out of the Keelung River just a couple dozen yards from the shore. The main section of fuselage was on its side, missing a wing.

Rescuers clustered around the plane in rubber boats more than two hours after the crash, and could be seen pulling carry-on luggage from an open plane door.

The rescue efforts were ongoing.

Four children were among the passengers, authorities said at a news conference. All passengers were Chinese or Taiwanese.

Officials said the plane joined the airline's fleet in September and had completed a safety check on Jan. 26. Authorities also said that the pilot had more than 4,400 hours of flying experience, while the co-pilot had more than 6,000 hours.

The crash marks the second tragedy involving one of TransAsia’s French-made ATR 72 planes in the past year. In July, a flight crashed while attempting to land on the island of Penghu off Taiwan's coast, killing 48 people and injuring another 10. Stormy weather and low visibility were suspected as factors in that crash.

16lbO7H,2015-02-02 00:00:00,"ISIS Hostages Likely Faced Mock Executions Before Beheadings, Officials Say - ABC News",http://abcnews.go.com/International/isis-hostages-faced-mock-executions-beheadings-officials/story?id=28661536,"After scrutinizing intelligence and every frame of videos featuring high-profile ISIS hostages, many counter-terrorism analysts and experts have concluded that some captives appeared compliant before being killed because they had already faced repeated mock executions on camera, current and former counter-terrorism officials told ABC News.

The staged executions were possibly made under the guise of an effort to scare their families and governments into meeting the terrorists' demands, the sources said.

Since ISIS slaughtered Japanese journalist Kenji Goto in a video released Saturday -- its seventh high-profile hostage beheaded -- government analysts have been looking for clues in the images about the location of other hostages and the British spokesman called ""Jihadi John,"" who has presented himself as each victim's executioner wielding a notched blade, officials said.

Many analysts and investigators have assessed, based in part on some freed hostages' debriefings and also on intelligence collection, that the seven ISIS killings were likely perpetrated off camera, after hostages were subjected to repeated staged executions before lights and cameras set up in the desert just south of the ISIS stronghold in the city of Raqqa.

The captives may have become conditioned to being returned to their cells after making the terrifying videos, which are not believed to have ever been sent to their families.

""The point was to eventually have compliant hostages on camera,"" said one counter-terrorism official.

This was suspected in August when officials involved in hostage response saw the first ISIS video with American journalist James Foley, whose cooperation appeared to be because he'd been marched out previously to videotape messages about his possible death if a whopping $130 million ransom demand by ISIS sent to his family wasn't paid.

""That was the assessment of why Foley was so compliant,"" a former law enforcement official close to the case told ABC News.

Foley may have been forced in front of ISIS's cameras many times before he was shown beheaded on the desert floor in light that indicated a different time of day, the current and former officials said.

Another indication the executions were carried out off camera is that Jihadi John has never drawn blood despite being shown a half-dozen times crossing his blade across the neck of a Western or Japanese hostage -- even when he has delivered as many as eight strokes with his large combat knife. Each time, the screen darkens just as he begins to cut and then jumps to a scene with the victim's head atop their body.

""The fade to black is a telling sign,"" a senior counter-terrorism official told ABC News, concurring with the other current and former officials.

One exception was a video released on Nov. 16. In that footage, Jihad John, along with a group of ISIS fighters, beheaded Syrian troops in a cinematic slaughter in which each killer's knife immediately spills blood with the first stroke until the horrific job was completed."

The Jordanian source says the troops will likely stay on their side of the border in a defensive posture, for now, and will not enter Iraq without approval from the Iraqi government.

Coalition firepower would support the Iraq-led offensive, he added.

Since ISIS released the barbaric video showing Jordanian pilot Moaz al-Kasasbeh burning alive last week, King Abdullah's revenge has been swift and Jordan’s military has ramped up its involvement in the fight against ISIS.

Gen. Allen, told ABC News’ “This Week” in an exclusive interview that the video “absolutely” backfired on the Islamic State group. Instead, he said, the video ""galvanized the coalition, unified the coalition.""

He added: “It’s a very important moment for our Arab allies within the coalition.""

Over the weekend, Jordan requested an expanded role in the coalition, according to U.S. officials. Jordanian F-16s launched a total of 56 airstrikes, successfully targeting arms depots, logistical centers and wiping out 20 percent of the group’s capabilities, according to Jordan’s air force chief Major General al Jobour.

The United Arab Emirates, one of the five Arab members of the U.S.-led coalition, which had quietly suspended airstrikes in December, re-engaged over the weekend,sending a squadron of F-16s to Jordan. The country’s official news agency said the move “reaffirm[ed] the UAE's unwavering and constant solidarity with Jordan."""

“It’s all of our home,” said the first lady, who was accompanied by first-daughter-turned-NBC-contributor Jenna Bush Hager. “This is the peoples’ house!”

With updates funded by contributions from the White House Historical Association, the room now houses an assortment of Obamas’ favorite modern art pieces all by American artists, including “Resurrection” by Alma Thomas and “Early Bloomer” by Robert Rauschenberg.

But it wasn't always so mod.

During the Truman era, the room was adorned with dark red draperies and matching carpet, then updated to a less-formal gold and yellow scheme approved by Jackie Kennedy in 1963, according to a White House blog.

Enjoyed by first families since 1825, the space functioned as a breakfast room until Mrs. Kennedy moved the family’s dining room upstairs to the first family’s private residence.

Since then, the room has been used as staging during state dinners, and to house any additional members of staff. Presidents have also used the dining room for lower-key official meals, including lunches with foreign leaders."

Anne Susan Diprizio, 44, of Prattville, Alabama, was trying to officiate the wedding of a same-sex couple inside the office just after the couple received their marriage license.

Same-sex couples married in some Alabama courthouses today, but many counties refused to allow the unions despite rulings on Monday from a federal judge and the U.S. Supreme Court to permit them.

As of Friday, the Autauga County Probate Office ceased all marriages inside the office. Probate Judge Al Booth told the Montgomery Advertiser newspaper that the decision to stop performing the ceremonies was related to work flow, not the recent federal court order lifting the state’s ban on same-sex marriages.

Autauga County Sheriff Joe Sedinger tells ABC News that Diprizio's attempt to perform a marriage was the only reason she was arrested for disorderly conduct and not with the fact it was a same-sex marriage.

On Tuesday, Diprizio got down on her knees and refused to leave the office when asked by deputies, according to the Sheriff's department.

Courtney Cannon and Morgan Plunkett of Autauga County received a marriage license from the probate office. The couple said they planned to go to the Montgomery County Probate Office to get married and didn't know the local probate office had stopped performing marriage ceremonies, according to the Advertiser.

Cannon told the Advertiser that Diprizio offered to perform the ceremony inside the probate office for the couple of three and a half years.

“I don’t even know her name, but she said she was an ordained minister and wanted to marry us,” Cannon said of Diprizio, according to the Advertiser. “She was standing up for our rights to get married. Judge Booth called the deputies after he told her to leave.”

Cannon, Plunkett and Diprizio could not be reached for comment by ABC News.

Sheriff Sedinger tells ABC News he and his colleagues were ""just doing our duty"" in arresting Diprizio.

""She was refusing to leave, so we arrested her for disorderly conduct,"" Sedinger said.

Diprizio's bond was set at $1,000 and she was released.

""I asked to speak with Judge Booth but he wouldn't see me,"" Diprizio told the Advertiser, adding that she would offer to perform marriage ceremonies again. ""I wanted to let him know that I will be back. They charged my with disorderly conduct, which I disagree with, I was not disorderly, I was very respectful."""

The engineer, Steven Smalls, recounted the ill-fated train's final minutes, and how he helped as many as seven people to safety from the burning train, when investigators interviewed him Friday, NTSB vice chairman Robert Sumwalt told reporters.

Smalls told investigators that he made all of the necessary checks before leaving Grand Central Station Tuesday on the evening route, which was his fourth and final run of the day, Sumwalt said.

As the train approached the scene of the crash that was to kill six people and injure at least a dozen, Smalls said he saw what he thought was a reflection at the crossing gate before realizing it was the “front end of a vehicle that was on the edge of the track,” which prompted him to “immediately” pull the emergency brake, Sumwalt added.

When the train hit the car, it was moving at 49 miles per hour, Sumwalt said. Smalls felt the collision and saw the car disappear underneath the front of the train.

He called in the crash on his radio, saying, “Emergency, emergency, emergency!” according to Sumwalt.

Smoke started flowing into the engineer’s compartment and Smalls told investigators he went into the first cabin of the train, helping five or six passengers out before getting out of the car.

""When smoke got too dense he exited the train,"" Sumwalt said.

After exiting, Sumwalt added, Smalls recounted seeing another passenger who was unable to walk crawling towards the door, so Small scooped him out “in a fireman’s pose.”

Additionally, the NSTB investigators met with the train’s conductor today, who was in the sixth car of the eight-car train at the time of the crash. The conductor felt the collision and, after hearing Smalls’ emergency call, made an announcement to passengers over the public address system to confirm the train had hit a car.

Sumwalt detailed the emergency evacuation procedure and told how 12 pieces of 39-foot sections of the third rail piled up in the first cabin of the train after the crash.

Five passengers from inside the train's front cabin died in the crash, as did the driver of the Mercedes SUV that was on the train tracks."

The team's manager, Darold Butler, has been suspended from Little League activity, and Illinois District 4 Administrator Michael Kelly has been removed from his position.

The organization found that the Jackie Robinson team used a falsified boundary map, and that team officials met with neighboring Little League districts in Illinois to claim players and build what amounts to a superteam.

As a result, the United States championship has been awarded to Mountain Ridge Little League from Las Vegas.

""For more than 75 years, Little League has been an organization where fair play is valued over the importance of wins and losses,"" Little League International CEO Stephen D. Keener said in a statement. ""This is a heartbreaking decision. What these players accomplished on the field and the memories and lessons they have learned during the Little League World Series tournament is something the kids can be proud of, but it is unfortunate that the actions of adults have led to this outcome.

""As our Little League operations staff learned of the many issues and actions that occurred over the course of 2014 and prior, as painful as this is, we feel it a necessary decision to maintain the integrity of the Little League program. No team can be allowed to attempt to strengthen its team by putting players on their roster that live outside their boundaries.""

Jackie Robinson West drew significant attention as it advanced to the tournament's title game, where it fell to Seoul, South Korea. In a sport that increasingly struggles to attract African-Americans, the team representing Chicago's South Side emerged as a force, beating Las Vegas 7-5 in the U.S. title game.

The Chicago players were lauded for not just their prowess on the field but also for their sportsmanship, and they later were honored by President Barack Obama at the White House.

Little League embraces policies designed to preserve traditional community-based leagues in which classmates play with classmates, friends with friends.

""Little League takes these matters very seriously and has spent countless hours gathering information about the many issues facing Jackie Robinson West Little League and Illinois District 4,"" Keener said. ""During our review, it became clear that both Jackie Robinson West officials and District Administrator, Mike Kelly signed documents to make players eligible who should not have been.""

The national organization said it was Kelly's responsibility to verify player eligibility based on player information that is gathered and signed by the league president, player agent and team manager."

Taya Kyle started to get worried when her husband didn't respond to a subsequent text message, and she said she learned her husband had been killed when a police officer showed up at her house shortly afterwards.

Pausing at points to wipe away tears during the first day of testimony in her husband's murder trial, Taya Kyle told the court, ""I'm not nervous. I'm just emotional.""

Eddie Ray Routh, now 27, the man accused of murdering Chris Kyle, 38, and Chad Littlefield, 35, Kyle's longtime friend, took notes throughout Taya Kyle's testimony.

#snipertrial Very difficult. Taya says she talked to Chris from range. Could tell he was irritated by something. pic.twitter.com/WclnF4imI5

Kyle said that her husband had never met Routh before Feb. 2, 2013, the day that they went to the Rough Creek Lodge gun range in Glen Rose, Texas, and he had decided to meet with him at the urging of Routh's mother.

Since retiring from the military in 2009, Kyle, who is recognized as the deadliest sniper in American military history, worked with veterans and regularly brought them to gun ranges.

Taya Kyle said that her husband believed that a week spent outdoors was more beneficial than a week in a hospital.

The 40-year-old mother of two, the first witness called in Routh's murder trial, revealed that Kyle, himself, had some difficulty adjusting to civilian life after a career spent largely overseas, noting that he drank and had night sweats. He eventually began to put on a little weight but he ""still looked great,"" she said in court.

Testifying later was Chad Littlefield's mother, Judy Littlefield, who appeared so overcome with emotion that, at first, she seemed barely able to speak.

If her son was alive, she said, today would have been his 38th birthday. He was ""a very good son,"" she added, noting that he called to check on her every day.

#snipertrial Judy Littlefield, Chad's mom. He would have been 38 today. She can barely say it's birthday. pic.twitter.com/Z2h6tniTd3

""Chad didn't talk much but was always watching to make sure people were safe,"" Judy Littlefield said.

She added that her son was not a veteran and first met Kyle when they were on the sidelines of their kids' soccer game.

The decision to have the women testify so early in the trial came largely because the judge ruled that no witnesses can be in the courtroom until after they have testified so they will not be affected by other testimony.

The trial began this morning with opening arguments from both sides, with District Attorney Alan Nash detailing Routh's alleged actions on the day of the shooting and defense attorney Tim Moore setting up his planned insanity defense. Routh faces life in prison if he is found guilty.

After both women finished their testimony, the manager of the shooting range, Frank Alvarez, told the court about the moment he was called to the range and saw people trying to resuscitate Kyle and Littlefield.

The prosecutor then began showing photos of the crime scene, including one that showed Kyle's dead body, during which Taya Kyle was seen shaking her head.

The man who first found Kyle and Littlefield's bodies, a responding police officer and a paramedic from the local fire department all testified this afternoon."

A decision was made to close the embassy until further notice because of violence and civil unrest stemming from the Houthi rebel takeover in Sana’a, officials said.

The evacuation lasted about six hours on Tuesday as various convoys made their way to the airport, but the State Department spokesman acknowledged today that not everything went as planned.

“Upon our departure, our vehicles and equipment were seized, reportedly, by the Houthis,"" State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said at a briefing to reporters. “We are looking into this. Clearly, it is unacceptable, and we would reiterate that in order to return to Sana'a, respect for property, respect for our facilities is -- is an essential component of that. So, we certainly are requesting they be returned.”

The vehicles were mostly armored SUVs, officials said.

Initially there were reports that the Houthis confiscated Marine weapons, but the Marines later disputed that account.

The Marine Corps said, “No Marine handed a weapon to a Houthi, or had one taken from him.""

""The Marine Security Force left the American embassy in Yemen for the movement to the airfield as part of the ""ordered departure"" with only personal weapons, according to a Marine statement. “All crew served weapons were destroyed at the embassy prior to movement. None of them were 'handed over' in any way to anyone. The destruction of weapons at the embassy and the airport was carried out in accordance with an approved destruction plan.”

Now that U.S. personnel have been removed, the concern has shifted to maintaining a counter-terrorism relationship with the fractured Yemeni government. The former president of Yemen, currently under house arrest, had been a critical partner in attacking al-Qaeda operatives in the region. Though the Shia dominated Houthis are not allied with al-Qaeda, there is a serious concern in Washington that they could end the partnership.

Yet, Pentagon officials expressed confidence that the missions will continue in the near future.

“We still have special operations forces in Yemen, we continue to conduct counter-terrorism training with Yemeni security forces, and we are still capable inside Yemen of conducting counter-terrorism operations,"" Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said Tuesday.

Meanwhile, the State department has not said where its embassy staff will be based in the interim and would not disclose who is responsible for guarding the building while the Americans are gone."

The sharp photos released today by NASA were taken on January 24 with the Hubble telescope. They show three of Jupiter's biggest moons, Europa, Callisto and Io, moving together across the face of the gas-giant planet.

The three moons are known as Galilean moons since they were discovered by the scientist during the 17th century. With orbits ranging from two to 17 days, it's common for at least one of the moons to be seen orbiting the Jupiter. However, the convergence of the three is an occurrence so rare that NASA said it happens only once or twice per decade.

The fourth Galilean moon, Ganymede, was outside the Hubble's view and was not part of the celestial sight.

Of Jupiter's moons, the most interest has centered around Europa, which is thought to have elements that could make it hospitable to multi-cellular life.

Getting a closer look could soon be a reality. The $18.5 billion NASA budget recently proposed by the White House for next year includes money earmarked ""for Planetary Science including formulation of a mission to Jupiter’s moon Europa.""

Under its icy shell, Europa is believed to have an interior ocean that could perhaps be 10 times deeper than those on Earth, and include two to three times the volume of all liquid water on our planet."

Diane Foley, whose son James Foley was shown in an Aug. 19 ISIS video being killed by the group's spokesman ""Jihad John,"" has spoken out before -- but Mueller's possible fate renewed her ire over what she feels was the government's inattention to the crisis.

""Kayla, along with our son and others were held for nearly two years and there were many opportunities along the way: several times when the captors reached out, several times when returning hostages brought sensitive information. And yet nothing was done to save our young Americans. So that's the part that deeply concerns me,"" Foley told ABC News in an interview, parts of which aired on ""World News Tonight.""

While Jordan did conduct airstrikes in Raqqa, ISIS has offered no evidence yet of her death, much less on that date or in a coalition bombing run.

Many counter-terrorism officials focused on ISIS remain deeply skeptical, while the Muellers in seclusion have signaled they do not know whether they should accept their daughter's death or not.

For much of 2013 and 2014, Diane Foley and hostage negotiators working for her family knew the likely locations of the western captives held by ISIS in Syria, even as they were moved from time to time. But the U.S. didn't launch a mission until July 3, when a squadron of operators from the elite Delta Force hit an oil refinery site near Raqqa, discovering it was a ""dry hole.""

Kayla Mueller had been among those held there, counter-terrorism sources have told ABC News.

""I certainly applaud the young, courageous soldiers who went on that mission. It was much too late and the intelligence obviously was poor -- it wasn't good enough for those courageous soldiers -- so they went in for nothing,"" Foley said.

A counter-terrorism official with knowledge of the planning and execution of the July 3 rescue operation said Diane Foley's assessment was correct.

""Washington took too long. We missed the hostages by two days. We could have had all the hostages -- all of them,"" the counter-terrorism official told ABC News last week, still upset over the outcome.

Since then, three American, two British, two Japanese and a Jordanian hostage have been executed in gruesome ISIS videos.

A spokesman for the National Security Council declined to address Foley's criticism directly but said the White House is conducting a review due this spring ordered by President Obama of the government's hostage policy, which generally falls under classified portions of National Security Presidential Directive-12."

Police say Artrai Alexander, 40, robbed a store then carjacked a white Dodge Challenger Wednesday, before leading cops on a high-speed, eight-mile pursuit. The chase ended in a major accident. The Challenger smashed into a minivan being driven by Jessica Liesmann.

Instead of waiting for police to arrive, Liesmann took matters into her own hands. Liesmann and her boyfriend Charles Cook stormed out of the minivan and confronted Alexander, holding onto the straps of his overalls and wrestling him to the ground before officers arrived.

Liesmann, on her way to pick up her daughter and with her 13-year-old son in the back seat, says the crash set off her maternal instinct.

“There’s no thinking, it’s just a reaction,” she said.

""You probably injure my son and you wreck my car, you’re gonna pay.""

Even Liesmann’s boyfriend was stunned by her response.

“I knew she had it in her, but I’m surprised she got out,” Cook said.

Alexander is being charged with aggravated robbery and evading arrest, according to the Dallas Police Department. He is being held on $75,000 bond and has not yet entered a plea, police said."

A surveillance camera in the hospital lobby caught the dog entering through the automatic doors and wandering around.

The dog, named Sissy, belongs to Nancy Franck, 64, who has been at Mercy Medical Center for about two weeks following surgery. Her husband, Dale Franck, 66, had been taking care of Sissy and her brother Barney, also a miniature Schnauzer, back home.

“She was on a mission that night to see her mom,"" Dale Franck told ABC News today, ""but she couldn't find the right elevator to take.""

He said he noticed Sissy was missing around 1:30 a.m. this past Saturday, and he was worried sick.

""I kept checking everywhere, calling out, 'Sissy! Sissy!'"" he recalled. ""I was pulling my hair out.""

He finally got a call at 5:30 a.m. from security officer Samantha Conrad at the hospital, saying she had found his dog, he said.

""She found my number and house address from her tag on her collar,"" Dale Franck said. ""I was so relieved, and I asked my daughter go and pick her up.""

The security officer and the hospital did not immediately respond to ABC News' calls for comment.

Dale Franck's daughter got permission to take Sissy up to Nancy Franck for a few minutes, he said.

""She told her mom, 'I got a surprise for you!'"" Dale Franck said. ""My wife was like, 'How'd you get her in here? Did you sneak her under your coat?""

His daughter said that the ""little spoiled brat"" ran away from home because she wanted to see her mom, Dale Franck said, though it's unclear how the dog actually got there.

""Nancy and Sissy were able to love each other for a few minutes, and then she went back with me,"" Dale Franck said. ""She's my baby, and though it sounds funny now, it wasn't funny when she was missing. I was worried sick. I'm glad she's OK.""

He has one theory about how Sissy might have gotten 20 blocks to his wife.

""The only thing I could think of was that Sissy used to ride with me to pick up my wife from work next door to the hospital,"" Dale Franck said. ""But we've never walked that route before.""

Nancy Franck has been battling uterine cancer, and though doctors believe most of the cancer is gone, she is undergoing chemotherapy to make sure, Dale Franck said.

""She has a close relationship with Sissy,"" he added. ""Sissy's 11 now, and we bought her when she was just about 8 weeks old. She came up to me, scratched my leg and fell asleep on my shoulder. I'd say we didn't pick her, she picked us."""

John Kitzhaber is showing no sign of stepping down, despite a criminal investigation involving him and his fiancée, and other politicians calling for him to resign.

Kitzhaber, 67, and his live-in fiancée, Cylvia Hayes, are being investigated for possible corruption. Hayes is under scrutiny for allegedly using her relationship with Kitzhaber to land contracts for her business as a clean-energy consultant.

""He was upset,"" Oregon Senate President Peter Courtney told reporters of a meeting with Kitzhaber on Thursday. ""He was defiant. He's struggling.""

Kate Brown, Oregon’s secretary of state, said Kitzhaber asked her to return abruptly from Washington, fueling speculation that he would step down. But when she arrived, she claimed he acted confused and vowed not to resign, while wanting to discuss her transition.

""This is clearly a bizarre and unprecedented situation,"" Brown said in a statement.

The state attorney general's office on Thursday ordered Hayes to release emails from private accounts that discuss state business following a public records request. Hayes, through a lawyer, opposed the request. She has seven days to comply or appeal.

Questions about Hayes have swirled for months, but the pressure on Kitzhaber intensified in recent weeks after newspapers raised questions about whether Hayes reported all her income on her tax returns.

In October, Hayes admitted that she and a former boyfriend bought land years earlier with plans to illegally grow marijuana. She also confessed to once marrying an immigrant in exchange for cash so he could remain in the country.

Neither the governor nor Hayes has been charged with any wrongdoing. But earlier this month, Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum said she was launching a criminal investigation.

Kitzhaber has said he and Hayes took steps to avoid conflicts of interest.

Anne Arundel Community College business professor Shad Ewart is one of the first in the country to offer a course on business opportunities in the marijuana industry along with the University of Denver and Oaksterdam University in Oakland, Calif.

“I almost felt like we were doing a disservice to our students by not having a class like this,” Ewart said. “It just seemed to be a topic that was ripe.”

As it turns out, it’s a topic that’s ripe among men and women of all ages. Students in the class range from 18 to 64 years old. Whether they’re just starting college or have been in the workforce for decades, all agree it’s time to be blunt about the marijuana industry.

“The energies inside this class allow all of us to connect ideas,” said 18-year-old Ky Hoffman. “Already it’s opened all of our minds to all of the possibilities in the future with marijuana in general. There are so many opportunities that are going to be there in the future.”

The class, titled “Entrepreneurial Opportunities in Emerging Markets: Marijuana Legalization,” which began at the beginning of the month, looks at job creation as an outgrowth of marijuana legalization, according to the college.

Wednesday, the class welcomed two guest speakers from Bay Area Remedies to discuss the business opportunities one can find beneath the smoke.

“The growing part and the dispensing part are going to be the most highly regulated parts of the industry and the other parts are far much easier,"" Ewart said. “I mean anyone can sell light bulbs, anyone can sell nutrients, anyone can sell soil.”

Last year, Maryland became the 18th state to decriminalize small amounts of marijuana, while four states- Washington, Oregon, Alaska and Colorado- made marijuana legal for recreational use.

Although the personal use and possession of marijuana is currently illegal in Maryland, many students are looking to combine interests and work to create something bigger.

“Look at the mix of people,” said Katherine, who asked that her last name not be used. “You have the young, energetic, committed students, you have older people who are probably more into the investment side, and it’s the combination that really makes it work.”

Professor Ewart says there’s a strong interest among students for this particular industry and he would prefer to “coach people up now in anticipation of something that may or may not happen down the road.”

“This college has a mandate from our president to be innovative,” Ewart said. “Everybody says they’re innovative. I think we’re actually being innovative.”"

While Spidey has always been a Marvel character, a 13-year-old licensing deal allowed only Sony to release movies featuring the web-slinger.

The results of late have been mixed: While the franchise has generated $4 billion for the studio, both the box office receipts and comic fan cred of a recent pair of reboot films paled in comparison to the Marvel Studios movies released by Disney, which include blockbusters like ""The Avengers,"" ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier,"" and ""Guardians of the Galaxy.""

The new deal will see the producer behind those and other hits, Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige, produce new Spidey movies for Sony but, even more exciting for fans, the deal will let Spidey join Iron Man, Captain America, The Hulk and his fellow Avengers on the big screen for the first time.

""I am thrilled to team with my friends at Sony Pictures along with Amy Pascal to produce the next Spider-Man movie,"" Feige aid in a statement. ""Marvel's involvement will hopefully deliver the creative continuity and authenticity that fans demand...I am equally excited for the opportunity to have Spider-Man appear in the MCU, something which both we at Marvel, and fans alike, have been looking forward to for years.""

The first Spider-Man film that will be co-produced by Feige under the new Sony deal will be released on July 28, 2017.

However, before that, Spidey will most likely appear in the Disney release ""Captain America: Civil War,"" set for release on May 6, 2016.

The web-slinger and his alter-ego Peter Parker play a major role in the Civil War comic series' plot, which sees Cap and Iron Man at each other's throats regarding a government program to register superheroes.

The July 28, 2017 Sony Spidey release has led Marvel Studios to also announce some new release date changes for its upcoming Disney flicks.

Marvel's ""Thor: Ragnarok"" will now hit theaters November 3, 2017; ""Black Panther"" will make its way to theaters on July 6, 2018; ""Captain Marvel"" will be released November 2, 2018; and Marvel's ""Inhumans"" will now be released July 12, 2019.

Release dates for ""Avengers: Infinity War Part 1"" and ""Avengers: Infinity War Part 2"" haven't changed -- they hit theaters on May 4, 2018 and May 3, 2019, respectively.

Disney is the parent company of ABC News."

Dr. Frank Esper, an infectious disease doctor with the UH Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital in Cleveland, stressed that each vaccine component is there for a reason and has been thoroughly tested for stability, safety and effectiveness.

“Nothing is thrown in there randomly,” he explained. “And everything is present in small amounts.”

Here, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention breakdown of the most common vaccine ingredients and why they’ve been added.

Live Virus

The MMR and some other vaccines do contain live virus, but Esper said they have essentially been neutered in the lab by chopping out the genes that cause dangerous infection. They’re included so the body learns what the real virus looks like and can mount an immuno-response against it.

Aluminum

Found in gel or salt form, a minuscule amount of this metal is added to vaccines as “adjuvant,” meaning it helps promote a quicker, more potent immune response to the vaccine. Esper said this ingredient has tested well in numerous safety trials.

Formaldehyde

A tiny amount of this preservative added into a vaccine kills unwanted viruses and bacteria that might contaminate the vaccine during production. Most formaldehyde is removed from the vaccine before it is packaged, according to both the CDC and the Food and Drug Administration.

Thimerosal and Mercury

It is true that mercury is toxic in high doses. But the mercury-containing preservative thimerosal was present in vaccines in smaller amounts than naturally occur in water or soil to prevent contamination and bacterial growth, Esper pointed out. In any case this is a moot point: The compound was removed from virtually all childhood vaccines more than a decade ago.

Other Ingredients

Some vaccines contain antibiotics to prevent contamination or monosodium glutamate (MSG) to protect against light, heat and humidity. Some flu and yellow fever vaccines also contain egg proteins as part of the preparation process and should be safe for anyone who can eat eggs."
17B89CG,2015-02-20 00:00:00,Selling the 'Fantasy': Why Young Women Would Join ISIS - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/International/young-women-join-isis/story?id=29112401,"British authorities’ desperate race to track down three teenage girls who they suspect are on their way to Syria to possibly connect with the terror group ISIS has reignited a question raised when a young American woman put herself in a similar position –- namely, why?

Commander Richard Walton of Britain’s Counter Terrorism Command said today that the two 15-year-olds and one 16-year-old are hardly alone in their quest to join jihadists and that British authorities “are concerned about the number of girls and young women who have or are intending to travel to the part of Syria that is controlled by the terrorist group calling themselves Islamic State [ISIS].”

So why would young women travel halfway around the world to a combat zone to link up with a terrorist group that has boasted about countless atrocities, including those committed against women?

Mostly for the same reasons that young men do, according to academics.

“ISIS has been on a very strong female recruitment drive, and women are joining ISIS for a variety of reasons, many of which are the same as men,” Jayne Huckerby, Director of the Duke International Human Rights Clinic, told ABC News in January. “Feelings of alienation, feelings of inequality. [For] adventure. In some cases, romance. And in many cases too, these women are responding to quite a deliberate call from the Islamic State [ISIS] to have women come and participate in a form of state-building and to make a new country in which they can practice their religion.”

“Women see themselves playing a number of roles in the group. They see themselves as recruiters for other young women. They see themselves as a very important part of the propaganda machine of ISIS,” Huckerby said.

Katherine Brown, a lecturer in Defence Studies at King’s College London, wrote for the BBC in August, “Women are joining [ISIS] because it provides a new utopian politics – participating in jihad and being part of the creation of a new Islamic state.”

“There is a great deal of romanticism in women’s accounts about being part of this political project with a new version of a political Islamic ‘good life’ built upon a particular idea of Islam and Sharia law,” Brown wrote. “The perceived failure of Western states to give Muslims a sense of belonging, purpose and value as Muslims and citizens is striking in the online accounts of these women jihadis.”

Mia Bloom, Professor at the Center for Terrorism and Security Studies at UMass Lowell, said ISIS has been selling the girls a “fantasy” escape.

“Most of the girls are drawn by a combination of fantasy and the feeling that by joining ISIS, they will be empowered, have an exciting life, and do something meaningful with their lives,” Bloom told ABC News today.

The ISIS recruitment drive for women has also played out in the same arena as it has for men: online.

Twitter accounts supposedly belonging to women living under ISIS rule describe their day-to-day lives in a positive light and beckon other Western women to join.

“[ISIS] pays for our houses, we get money monthly, food aid, travelling aid, soldiers protecting our borders, everything,” one such account said this week, according to the SITE Intelligence Group. “…[W]ith every child we get extra money, No kafir [disbeliever] country does!”

Brown wrote that the women online “offer the women advice, support, help with travel, and are a source of propaganda for [ISIS], presenting idealized notions of an Islamic life and jihad.”

“Online networks facilitate their travel and help coordinate them with expat communities once they arrive,” she said.

Bloom also noted that male members of ISIS work to woo women online so they’ll to travel to the Middle East, where the men can marry one or more of them, or the women can be used as lures for other male recruits.

“It’s all about the social media that is being used to lure these young women,” she said. “Then the women are used as a reward. They are ranked according to value in terms of blondes and converts will be more desirable… By marrying them [the women] off and encouraging children immediately, it retains the men and makes it less likely that they will go back to their home countries.”

Huckerby spoke to ABC News in January when a 19-year-old American woman, Shannon Conley, was sentenced to four years in prison for attempting to go to Syria to join ISIS. The FBI had said Conley fell in love with a member of the group online and planned to travel to the Middle East to marry him.

FBI agents reportedly met with the Colorado woman repeatedly beginning in late 2013, trying to talk her out of supporting the terror group. But the AP reported that Conley flatly told the agents she was going to wage jihad in the Middle East, even if it was illegal.

Judge Raymond Moore said the four-year sentence was meant to deter others from following in Conley’s footsteps."
17CdA4g,2015-02-20 00:00:00,Changing the Face of Modeling Through Imperfections with Pride - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/changing-face-modeling-imperfections-pride/story?id=29086195,"New York Fashion Week this year hosted a new crop of models who are revolutionizing the runway, embracing what some might call “imperfections” with pride.

Winnie Harlow is one of those models.

The 20-year-old darling with prominent vitiligo, the same skin disease Michael Jackson said he had, was chosen as the face of both Diesel and Desigual.

This time last year, Harlow was an unknown, until her Instagram account caught Tyra Banks’ eye, who cast her on “America’s Next Top Model.” Although she didn’t end up winning her season, Harlow was still thrilled for the exposure.

“I wanted to be on the show as a platform to show the world me and see what could come out of that,” Harlow said. “But I didn’t think that I was going to win because of course it’s a reality show, so I thought there was going to be strategies and what not what have you.”

Her road to success was rocky at best. Harlow said she was bullied in school.

“It started in middle school I would say, they would call me names like cow, zebra, there were a few physical altercations,” she said. “As I got older and started accepting myself and loving all of my flaws, I was like ‘I can do this.’”

It was after she dropped out of high school, Harlow said, that she said she started to “focus on my own opinions” of her appearance, and embraced it.

The rise of the so-called “flawed model” is a major turn from the era of classic beauties, such as Christie Brinkley, Cindy Crawford or Naomi Campbell.

“Ten years ago models like that would not have been on the runway because our definition of beauty was much narrower,” said Robin Givhan, an award-winning fashion critic for The Washington Post. “There are models who are at the top of the industry who have sort of a quirky look. ... There’s room being made for women and for men who designers feel have an IT factor that makes them compelling on the runway.”

There was a resounding theme of “inspirational” at this year’s Fashion Week. The FTL Moda show featured gorgeous models in wheelchairs, and the first-ever male amputee to walk at New York Fashion Week. At the Carrie Hammer show, actress Jamie Brewer made history as the first person with Down syndrome to walk the runway.

“I think we should celebrate the moment but not necessarily assume the moment is going to lead to a new era,” Givhan said. “I think for designers who are always trying to push the edges of their creativity I think they’re always searching for something that is different and something that will surprise us and something that will make them stand out.”

Another rising star in the fashion world is 23-year-old Shaun Ross, who is albino. He has worked with some of the biggest names in the business, including Givenchy and Alexander McQueen, and being featured in publications GQ and Vogue Italia.

“I know there are going to be people out there that are going to make fun of me,” Ross said. “There are going to be people out there who are not going to see this vision eye to eye the way I do, but I know that I have everything that it takes to make people see things differently.”

It’s that confidence that has propelled him to career highs, including a collaboration with Beyonce. Ross played a memorable role in her music video for “Pretty Hurts,” depicting a brutal beauty director."
17CjX7A,2015-02-21 00:00:00,Kurt Busch suspended indefinitely - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/kurt-busch-suspended-indefinitely/story?id=29116354,"Earlier Friday it was ruled that Busch smashed his ex-girlfriend Patricia Driscoll's head against his motor home wall Sept. 26 at Dover International Speedway, according to the conclusions of a Kent County (Del.) family court commissioner who granted Driscoll's request for a protective order Monday.

""Given the serious nature of the findings and conclusions made by the Commissioner of the Family Court of the State of Delaware, NASCAR has indefinitely suspended driver Kurt Busch, effective immediately,"" NASCAR said in a statement. ""He will not be allowed to race nor participate in any NASCAR activities until further notice.

""Kurt Busch and his Stewart-Haas Racing team are fully aware of our position and why this decision was made. We will continue to respect the process and timetable of the authorities involved.""

Busch on Friday night filed paperwork for an appeal on his suspension, which will be heard at noon ET Saturday in Daytona, NASCAR spokesman David Higdon said.

""We are extremely disappointed that NASCAR has suspended Kurt Busch,"" Busch's attorney, Rusty Hardin, said in a statement Friday afternoon. ""We assure everyone, including NASCAR, that this action against Mr. Busch will turn out to be a travesty of justice, apparent to all, as this story continues to unfold.""

Hardin, who cannot represent Busch in the NASCAR appeal because the appeal process does not allow for lawyers to represent NASCAR members, reiterated his hope that the family court commissioner reconsiders his opinion based on additional evidence that would show Driscoll is not credible.

""It is important for everyone to remember that the commissioner's report has to do with a civil, family law matter and no criminal charges have been filed against Mr. Busch,"" Hardin said. ""We ask everyone's patience as this case continues in the court of law and are confident that when the truth is known Mr. Busch will be fully vindicated and back in the driver's seat.""

NASCAR appeals are heard by a three-member panel selected from a list of former drivers, racing promoters and racing executives in the NASCAR rule book.

During the appeal, NASCAR will present its evidence, Busch will make his argument and then they both are permitted opportunities for rebuttal. Both sides can bring witnesses but not legal counsel, and the panelists can summon any NASCAR member from whom they want to hear.

If Busch loses the appeal, he can make one last appeal to former Gulfstream president Bryan Moss, NASCAR's final appeals officer. NASCAR chairman Brian France also has the ability to lift the suspension at any time.

It wasn't immediately clear if Busch wins his appeal whether he could still drive for SHR, which gets a significant amount of financial support from Chevrolet.

In her statement, Driscoll said she did not consider this a ""victory.""

""For victims of domestic violence there are no victories,"" she said. ""My only hope is that the pain and trauma I suffered through this process will help other victims find their voice."
17CkbM7,2015-02-20 00:00:00,3-D Printed Heart Gives New Hope to Woman With 'Backwards' Heart - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Health/printed-heart-hope-woman-backwards-heart/story?id=29107278,"A 3-D printed heart has given new hope to a 26-year-old woman who was born with a “backwards” heart.

Kami Sutton, of Marysville, Washington, has already undergone 19 surgeries to help connect her heart to the rest of her body.

She was born with a congenital heart defect that resulted in her heart being on the right side of her body instead of the left side. Additionally, Sutton’s left and right pumping chambers were reversed and her heart was not initially connected to her lungs. She also had a hole in her heart between the two chambers.

While surgeries and a pacemaker have helped keep Sutton alive, her heart has been weakened by constant stress and overexertion.

Last year, Sutton started working with Dr. Stephan Seslar, a congenital heart disease specialist and electrophysiologist at Seattle Children’s Hospital and University of Washington Medical Center, to see if a new pacemaker would work better.

Seslar is now attempting hoping to use a bi-ventricular pacemaker that will help Sutton's ventricles beat at the same time. But the unusual shape and placement of Sutton’s heart remains a huge hurdle.

“Kami’s heart is truly one-of-a-kind,” Seslar said on the Seattle Children’s Hospital website. “Operating on her without understanding the anatomy of her heart better could be very dangerous.”

To help doctors plan out Sutton's surgery, Seslar created a specially designed 3-D model of Sutton's heart. It’s an idea she initially suggested to Seslar, who had already been working on similar models.

“His eyes got really wide,” Sutton remembered of the moment she asked if he could use a 3-D model of her heart. “When I suggested it, he got really excited.”

To create a model of Sutton’s heart, she underwent a CT scan so that the exact measurements of her heart could be diagrammed. Seslar then worked with a materials engineer to create a special material that would mimic heart tissue.

“Our first attempts produced stiff models that did not feel like human hearts,” Seslar said on the Seattle Children’s Hospital website. “This model is soft and wet like a real heart inside a person. ... We know ahead of time where to maneuver, it allows us to develop a game plan and potentially reduce the surgery time.”

Sutton, who works as a grassroots coordinator for the American Heart Association, hasn’t seen the model of her heart yet, but said she feels privileged to benefit from the new technology.

“Technology caught up with me just in time and gave me another chance besides the big [transplant] surgery,” Sutton said of both this experience and her past surgeries.

Sutton is on the heart transplant list, but her previous surgeries means she needs a very particular kind of organ that will not be rejected by her immune system. However, she said if the pacemaker works she may not need the new heart."
17CKTEv,2015-02-27 00:00:00,Things You Should Know About Cholesterol - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Health/things-cholesterol/story?id=29254919,"Cholesterol seems to be one of those words that’s in everyone’s vocabulary, but many of my clients are incredibly confused about what cholesterol is, and how it affects their health. It also happens to be buzzing in the media at the moment, thanks to a new report from the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee, a group of top nutrition researchers who advise the government about what and how Americans should be eating.

If you’re feeling a little perplexed by all this cholesterol talk, here’s a simple breakdown of what you really need to know.

There are two types: dietary cholesterol and blood cholesterol. Dietary cholesterol is the cholesterol found in foods, and only foods of animal origin contain it, because animals’ bodies naturally produce this waxy, fat-like substance. So when you eat an animal-based food (think eggs, dairy, meat, seafood) you’re ingesting cholesterol that an animal’s body produced. Plant-based foods do not contain any cholesterol, so if you see a jar of nut butter marked “cholesterol free” know that they didn’t remove the cholesterol—it just wasn’t there to begin with.

16 Most Misleading Food Labels

Even if you ate zero animal foods, you’d still have cholesterol in your body. That’s because your liver produces cholesterol and it’s needed for several key functions, including the making of hormones, vitamin D, and substances that help you digest food. While cholesterol is vital, it isn’t considered to be an essential nutrient, meaning something you must obtain from foods, like vitamin C or potassium. That’s because your body produces all of the cholesterol it needs.

The two types of blood cholesterol you hear about most often are HDL (the “good” kind; think happy cholesterol) and LDL (the “bad” kind; think lousy cholesterol). HDL and LDL are actually carriers of cholesterol called lipoproteins. HDL is good because it carries cholesterol away from arteries and back to the liver, where it can be removed from your body. LDL—the bad type—has the opposite effect. Too much LDL can lead to a build-up, which clogs and narrows arteries, and creates inflammation. This chain of events can lead to a sudden rupture, which sends a clot into the bloodstream, causing a heart attack and/or stroke.

9 Subtle Signs You Could Have a Heart Problem

The old thinking was that consuming dietary cholesterol added to the cholesterol that your body naturally produces, thus raising the amount in your blood. This was perceived to be risky, because too much blood cholesterol has been shown to up the risk of heart disease, the top killer of both men and women. One often-cited statistic is that every 1% increase in total blood cholesterol is tied to a 2% increase in the risk of heart disease.

For many years, the Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommended that dietary cholesterol should be limited to no more than 300 mg per day. To put that in perspective, one egg yolk contains about 185 mg, three ounces of shrimp contains about 130 mg, two ounces of 85% lean ground beef about 60 mg, and one tablespoon of butter about 30 mg. The brand new report eliminated this cap, however, because the committee believes that the research shows no substantial relationship between the consumption of dietary cholesterol and blood cholesterol levels. As such, they concluded, “Cholesterol is not a nutrient of concern for overconsumption.”

Nearly every media outlet covered the release of the report from the Dietary Guidelines committee, zeroing in on the omission of cholesterol limits—but that doesn’t mean it’s now healthy to go out and down cheeseburgers and pepperoni pizzas. The committee is still concerned about the relationship between blood cholesterol and saturated fat from foods like cheese.

You may have heard about another recent report, which concluded that a lower intake of saturated fat wasn’t linked to a lower risk of heart disease. That’s true, but it’s not the whole story, because the risk really lies in what you replace the saturated fat-laden foods with. When people curb saturated fat, but eat more carbohydrates, they lower protective levels of “good” HDL cholesterol, and drive up triglycerides (a type of blood fat), a combo that may actually up the risk of heart disease. But numerous studies have shown that replacing foods like butter and cheese with plant-based fats like almond butter, avocado, and olive oil can help lower heart disease risk.

Bottom line: the number one message from the new Dietary Guidelines report is that we all need to be eating less sugar and processed foods, and more plants, including vegetables, fruits, whole grains, beans and lentils. So if you have cholesterol from something like eggs, pair them with other whole, nutrient-rich plant foods, like veggies and avocado, combined with some fruit, black beans, sweet potato, or quinoa. That’s good nutrition.

The complaint, obtained by ABC News, seeks half a billion dollars in damages on behalf of the city of Stratford, located in Ontario, Canada and alleges Trinity Industries of Dallas, the manufacturer of the ET-Plus guardrail system, ""misled its customers"" by not disclosing ""secret” modifications it had made to its product.

""Trinity was aware of multiple serious failures of their secretly modified ET-Plus guardrail end terminals, but continued to manufacture and sell the modified version without disclosing the changes, resulting in tens of thousands of the units being installed across Canada,"" the complaint reads. ""It is believed that there are tens of thousands of these defective, secretly modified, ET-Plus guardrail end terminals on the highways, as well as provincial and municipal roadways, across Canada.""

The ET-Plus guardrail system, which is used in states throughout the U.S., was the subject of an ABC News ""20/20"" investigation last year. ABC News obtained an internal Trinity email from 2005 in which a Trinity official estimated that making a modification to its widely-used guardrail system -- reducing a piece of metal in the end terminal from five inches to four -- would save the company $2 per end terminal, or $50,000 a year.

Trinity made the modification that year without alerting U.S. federal or state officials and critics have since blamed the change for rendering the end terminal defective when hit, sometimes impaling vehicles and causing severe injury or death. The company has maintained that the modified ET-Plus is safe and continues to meet federal standards.

News of the complaint from Stratford, which happens to be the hometown of pop star Justin Bieber, was first brought to light by Trinity itself in an annual shareholders report just filed by the publicly-held company in which it disclosed pending litigation.

""The Statement of Claim in this litigation generally alleges that Trinity Industries, Inc., Trinity Highway Products and Trinity Industries Canada, failed to warn of dangers associated with undisclosed modifications to the ET Plus guardrail end terminals, breached its implied warranty, breached its duty of care, and was negligent,"" the Trinity earnings report reads.

Trinity spokesman Jeff Eller would not comment on the complaint and told ABC News the company has not yet officially been served.

The Canadian complaint is the second of three class action lawsuits filed against Trinity surrounding the ET-Plus system. In November, a class action complaint was filed in Illinois on behalf of the counties in that state, alleging fraud on the part of Trinity for not disclosing the modifications. And earlier this week, a class action complaint was filed in Wisconsin, also alleging the company was fraudulent in selling the altered ET-Plus to transportation departments.

While three Canadian provinces - Quebec, Alberta and Nova Scotia - have suspended the use of the ET-Plus on its roadways, the province in which the city of Stratford lies, Ontario, Canada's second largest province, has not removed the ET-Plus from its list of approved products. According to the complaint, officials there are “actively monitoring the developments in the United States.”"
17DZ1gy,2015-02-20 00:00:00,The Story Behind Florida Obituary Saying Man Died Due to 'Uppercut From Batman' - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/US/story-florida-obituary-man-died-due-uppercut-batman/story?id=29113866,"Only the good die young. That phrase rings true for a Florida family that lost Stephen Merrill, 31, who loved superhero comics so much that they wrote in his obituary on Sunday that he passed away due to an ""uppercut from Batman.""

Merrill, a father of a 7-year-old boy, died unexpectedly at home in Winter Haven, Florida, on Feb. 12, and the family didn't know the cause of death when they wanted to submit an obituary before his funeral, his sister Kimberly Merrill told ABC News today. Their dad suggested they just make up something ""exotic,"" she said.

""One of Stephen's friends Brandon Moxam suggested to say he died from Batman's uppercut because he was a huge Batman fan,"" his sister said. ""Everyone laughed, and we knew that was what Stephen would've wanted us to say.""

The Ledger, based in Lakeland, Florida, was resistant to publishing the obituary at first, but after Stephen's close friend Andrew Albreacht told the manager of the obituaries department it would mean the world to them to honor Stephen in this way, the newspaper finally agreed, his sister said.

The funeral on Tuesday was just as unconventional as Stephen's obituary, his fiancee Stephanie Vella told ABC News.

""It was more of a celebration of his life rather than a funeral,"" Vella said. ""A bunch of us wore superhero t-shirts or bright colors, we told funny stories about Stephen and of course, we played some music from some of his favorite superhero movies like 'Star Spangled Man' from 'Captain America' and the 'Evolution of Batman.'""

There was even a ""Captain America"" shield flower arrangement made from roses and carnations, Vella said.

""Stephen was the family's superhero,"" Vella said. ""He was the glue that held the family together. He had so many legitimate reasons to not be positive, but he always remained so positive. He was so kind and caring.""

Merrill was diagnosed with testicular cancer near the end of June 2013, and has gone in and out of remission and the hospital for the past two years, Vella said, adding he was just about to start aggressive chemotherapy before his death. But despite all this, he remained a ray of light to the family, she said.

""He was a big kid,"" she added. ""There was nothing he liked better than playing 'Lego Batman' with our son Noah on the Xbox. Noah is also a huge fan of superheroes and Legos, and he always loved telling people his daddy worked at Legoland.""

Vella said every day is a struggle for her.

""I want to tell him, 'Babe, I know you’re looking down on all of us right now, and before you passed you questioned if you had done enough with your life and what your legacy would be,'"" Vella said. ""But this is your legacy. Look at how many lives you've touched, people you've made laugh and the mark you've left on this world.""

Vella said she is having a ""Batman"" tattoo designed for her to pay tribute to Stephen.

The family has since found out the cause of death, but the family has asked ABC News not to disclose it."

Nemtsov, a prominent opposition leader, was shot multiple times in the back as he walked by a bridge near the Kremlin late Friday night, according to Russia's Investigative Committee.

Russian news reports said that Nemtsov was walking with a female companion when a white car pulled up and fired on him before fleeing the scene.

Unidentified killers fired ""at least seven or eight shots"" at Nemtsov when the politician was walking on Bolshoy Kammeny Bridge in central Moscow, Russian Investigative Committee spokesman Vladimir Markin said.

""Witnesses to the killing are being questioned, and the crime scene is being carefully examined,"" Markin said.

Nemtsov was a former deputy prime minister under Boris Yeltsin during the 1990s, but fell out with the Russian president and formed Russia's People's Freedom Party.

The reason for the attack remains a mystery. A Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said President Putin was aware of the news and called it a provocation. ""Putin noted that this cruel murder has every sign of being a contract one which has solely provocative nature,"" Peskov said, according to the Interfax news agency.

""The president has ordered the leadership of the Investigative Committee, the Interior Ministry and the Federal Security Service to form an investigative group and keep the investigation of this crime under personal control,"" Peskov said.

""The Russian president expresses deep condolences to relatives and friends of Boris Nemtsov, who died tragically,"" Peskov added.

The former U.S. Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul tweeted: ""I cannot believe that they have killed my friend, Boris Nemtsov.""

Nemtsov's death comes just days before he was expected to take part in a large anti-Putin protest planned on Sunday.

Nemtsov was one of the organizers of large street protests against President Putin in recent years, always marching at the front of the crowd and addressing them from the stage.

He was the author of several reports on corruption in Russia, including attempts to estimate President Putin's wealth and the amount of money stolen during preparations for last year's Winter Olympics in Sochi.

""I was born in Russia and will die in this country,"" he told ABC News' Brian Ross in December 2013 when asked if he was afraid of being targeted for his opposition to President Putin.

""Everybody who against him must be very careful,"" he said.

Asked what motivated him, Nemtsov replied: ""I think that we must replace him because he did everything against an interest of my country; corruption, dependence on oil and gas, absence of technology, monopolization. He doesn't want to invest money to middle class. He forgets about health care and the population.""

""Russian authorities should thoroughly and impartially investigate Nemtsov's killing,"" said Tanya Cooper, Russia researcher at Human Rights Watch. ""The authorities need to consider all possible motivations for his killing, including Nemtsov's political activity.""

In an interview published today, Nemtsov told the Financial Times he believed U.S. sanctions on Russia were beginning to have an effect on Putin's popularity. Stagnant wages and soaring inflation topped the agenda when he met with residents of Yaroslavl, a town northeast of Moscow, last week.

""They believed that the embargo on imported foods is America's fault, and they were surprised when I told them no, that was not Obama, it was Putin,"" Nemtsov told the Financial Times. ""This is what we need to make people aware of the crisis. Putin's rating will not stay at above 80 per cent forever. It will start coming down, very gradually. And once it does, the fear will diminish, too, and at some point some big business will start supporting and financing us.""

Before police found the car, Kvapil told ABC News that he thought his race team was playing a joke on him when they called him about it.

""When I got texts and voicemails this morning [Friday] from the guys, I kind of thought they were messing around,"" said Kvapil.

Surveillance video shows a black pickup truck speeding off with a 15-foot trailer, which had the car inside. Team Xtreme racing owner John Cohen said today he believed the thieves were only after the trailer and did not realize the car, an extra engine, and $100,000 worth of spare parts were also inside.

""When you get a car stolen, you don't go out and buy another one,"" Cohen had said before the car was found.

Despite finding the car, Kvapil will not be able to race in Sunday's Sprint Cup race. His team was forced to withdraw when it missed NASCAR's mandatory inspection on Friday."

Police and other officials still have not formally identified the slain 22-year-old believed behind attacks at a free-speech event and a Jewish synagogue that left two people dead and five wounded.

There are no signs the gunman was part of a wider terror cell, Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt said, despite the arrests of two alleged accomplices. However, Thorning-Schmidt added, according to The Associated Press, the attacks appeared to be terrorism based upon the targets.

""We have no indication at this stage that he was part of a cell,"" she said. ""But we will of course in the coming time evaluate our fight against radicalization. We are already doing a lot.""

The suspected gunman had a history of violence and may have been inspired by Islamic terrorists -- and possibly by the Charlie Hebdo massacre in Paris, police said.

Danish police on Sunday also arrested two men suspected of helping the person blamed for the attacks, they said in a statement.

The two alleged accomplices were arraigned today and ordered jailed at a custody hearing held behind closed doors. Michael Juul Eriksen, the defense attorney for one of the two suspects and the man who identified El-Hussein to ABC News, told public broadcaster DR that the two were accused of giving the gunman shelter and getting rid of a weapon.

Police said they were searching for people who witnessed the first shooting, which occurred Saturday at a cultural center hosting a seminar on free speech attended by an artist who had depicted the Prophet Muhammad. Documentary filmmaker Finn Noergaard, 55, was killed in that attack.

Shots were later fired near a synagogue, with a civilian security guard killed, police said. He was identified as Dan Uzan, 37.

Hours later, a gunman -- believed by police to be the same man who launched the earlier attacks -- was killed in a gun battle with a SWAT team.

Police added that the suspected gunman went to an Internet café between the two attacks, though they did not divulge what he did during his time there.

A survivor of Saturday’s attack at the Copenhagen café credited security guards with helping to contain the situation.

When the gunfire started, Helle Merete Brix said, the Swedish state security guards and Danish intelligence officers there ""reacted very quickly.""

""They were in the lobby and, if they hadn't shot back, he could have shot his way through and something like Charlie Hebdo could have happened,"" she said, referring to the attack on the office of the satirical Paris newspaper last month in which 12 people were killed.

Britt Aboutaleb, the managing editor for Yahoo Style, gave ABC News a few hints about what to expect this year on the red carpet.

Here are five trends that she predicts will be big.

1. White: ""White has been huge this season—it's fresh, youthful, easy to wear, and frankly looks great against a red carpet.""

2. Metallic: ""We've seen sequins, fringe, hardware, and an array of metallic fabric on the red carpet. Nothing screams celebration like gold and silver, and again, there's a flattering shade for everyone.""

3. Old-Hollywood Hair: ""Actresses typically play it safe for the Oscars and that means long soft curls that pay homage to Veronica Lake.""

4. Fashion Forward Looks: ""Again, actresses like to play it safe on Hollywood's biggest night, but a handful of nominees are also die-hard fashion fans. Julianne Moore, Felicity Jones and Rosamund Pike all take risks on the red carpet and could break from tradition.""

5. Scruff: ""Will the men shave for the year's fanciest party? Based on the red carpets so far this year, the answer is no. Facial hair has never been so black tie appropriate."""

Helle Merete Brix, one of the organizers of the meeting Saturday titled ""Art, Blasphemy and Freedom of Expression,"" where one person was killed and three police officers wounded after a gunman opened fire, called the experience ""surreal.""

When the gunfire started, she said, the Swedish state security guards and Danish intelligence officers there ""reacted very quickly.""

""They were in the lobby and if they hadn't shot back, he could have shot his way through and something like Charlie Hebdo could have happened,"" she said, referring to the attack on the office of the satirical Paris newspaper last month in which 12c people were killed.

When the shooting started she said, in an interview with ABC News' Terry Moran, no one quite knew for a moment what was happening.

""I was conducting the meeting,"" she said. ""I was talking about freedom of speech. We heard all this noise. The next thing that happened the security guys told everybody to run out as fast as you can.

""I had this surreal experience, what was going on, when the security guard started shouting I thought my god this is an attack,"" she said.

The guards told them all to go into a storage room, where she said they dove under a table.

""We held hands and told bad jokes,"" she said. ""There was a lot of beer.""

Like Swedish artist Lars Vilks, one of the co-hosts of the event who has faced numerous death threats after drawing a cartoon of the Prophet Muhammad in 2007, she said she knew there was danger.

""Even though we knew there was a risk, we didn't expect anything like this to happen -- then this horror and death,"" she said.

She said it is too important to stand up for the value of free speech.

""We're fighting a battle, but freedom of speech is the core value of western society,"" she said. ""Without freedom of speech, other values aren't worth much. You can discuss and disagree in a civilized matter.""

Hours after the shooting at the cafe, a gunman -- believed by police to be the same man -- opened fire near a synagogue in the city, killing one man and wounding two police.

Officers later confronted the suspect in the Noerrebro district of the city, and he was killed in a shootout, police said.

""I don't feel responsible, but I feel a lot of sorrow that this happened,"" she said. ""There's only one person to blame and that's the guy who fired the shots."""

In a new public service announcement released today, Kate makes an appeal on behalf of Place2Be as the charity launches its first Children's Mental Health Week in the U.K.

In the video that's just about two minutes long, Kate talks about the challenges to children's mental health -- including bullying, bereavement, domestic violence and family problems.

Without support, she says, those challenges can become traumatic, leading to mental health problems in children such as anxiety, depression, addiction and self-harm.

""The stigma around mental health means that many children do not get the help that they so badly need. This needs to change. That is why the charity Place2Be is asking us all to talk openly this week,"" Kate, 33, said. ""We need to help young people and their parents understand that it's not a sign of weakness to ask for help.""

She also said a child's mental health was ""just as important as their physical health and deserves the same quality of support,"" noting that ""no one would be embarrassed"" to seek help for a child with a broken arm.

""We really should be equally ready to support a child coping with emotional difficulties,"" Kate, wearing a long-sleeved, belted, blue print dress and with her hair down, added.

Kate also said she and her husband, Prince William, sincerely believe early action can prevent problems in childhood from becoming more serious later in life.

""That is why we're both supporting Place2Be this Children's Mental Health Week, and I hope you'll join us,"" she said.

Kate is pregnant with the couple's second child, due in late April. They don't know the child's gender as they want it to be a surprise. Their first child, George, is 19 months.

Place2Be is a charity that provides emotional support to children more than 230 schools across the United Kingdom. Kate is the organization's royal patron.

According to Place2Be's website, depression and anxiety have increased among teenagers by 75 percent in the past 25 years, and three children in every classroom have a diagnosable mental health problem. The organization also said children were less likely to suffer from serious mental health difficulties later in life if they receive support at an early age.

Children's Mental Health Week officially launches on Monday."

The three girls -- Shamima Begum, 15, Amira Abase, 15, and Kadiza Sultana, 16 -- were last seen February 17 when they boarded a flight from London's Gatwick airport headed for Turkey. The surveillance video shows them waiting at a bus station on the European side of Istanbul later that same day, reports to the BBC.

Time codes on the surveillance video suggest the girls were at the bus station for about 18 hours, reports the BBC.

The girls' relatives have made emotional pleas for them to return home.

""If you're watching this, baby, please come home,"" said Renu Begum, an older sister of one of the missing girls, Shamima Begum, told the BBC last week. ""Mum needs you more than anything in the world. You’re our baby and we just want you home, we want you safe. Just contact anybody let them know that you need help.""

Abase Hussen, the father of Amira Abase, told the BBC his daughter told him she was going to a wedding when she left the family home.

A relative of Kadiza Sultana said ""everyone's hurting... especially mum.""

""Find the courage in your heart to contact us and let us know that you're safe and you're OK,"" the relative said.

17ifl6g,2015-02-17 00:00:00,'American Sniper' Trial: The Bizarre Message the Alleged Killer Left for Chris Kyle - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/US/american-sniper-trial-bizarre-message-alleged-killer-left/story?id=29000025,"The ""American Sniper"" jury heard voice mail messages that accused killer Eddie Ray Routh exchanged with Chris Kyle before they met to go for a fatal trip to a Texas gun range.

Four voice mails were played for the court and, while three were perfunctory, one gave some insight into Routh's apparent state of mind leading up to the Feb. 2, 2013, shooting.

""Kind of a sad day when it rains. It's a good sad. Rain will come and rains will leave. I guess that's what they do,"" Routh was heard saying on the tape.

Jeff Shaffer, a former Secret Service agent who now specializes in cybersecurity and computer forensics, analyzed the calls and said Kyle and Routh spoke several times, with those calls lasting between two and 15 minutes each.

Kyle's call logs show that in addition to receiving two calls from his wife, Taya, he had missed calls from people close to Routh.

Routh's girlfriend, Jennifer Weed, tried to call Kyle at 1:37 p.m. and 6:14 p.m. on the day of his slaying, along with Routh's mother, who called the former Navy Seal at 6:06 p.m.

Kyle regularly worked with veterans after retiring from the military and he offered to try to help Routh, a former Marine, after Routh's mother reached out to him.

The phone records came this afternoon as part of the fourth day of the double murder trial, following the testimony of three law enforcement officials involved in the case.

The Texas jailer who transported Routh after the slaying of Kyle and Kyle's friend Chad Littlefield said the suspect was irritated during the drive.

Sgt. Kenny Phillips of the Erath County Jail testified this morning about Feb. 2, 2013, when he transferred Routh from one jail to another after he was arrested in the shooting deaths of Kyle and Kyle's friend Chad Littlefield.

Phillips said Routh, now 27, asked for a cigarette during the drive.

""I would call him under the influence maybe,"" Phillips said in Erath County court this morning, noting that Routh's attitude changed “a great deal"" during the ride.

#snipertrial sgt Kenny Phillips brought Routh from Lancaster to Erath Co jail. pic.twitter.com/pNHJgs5fSH

Phillips said Routh ""was in a detox situation for a while.”

Routh's use of marijuana on the morning of the shooting had come up in the trial last week, with his uncle testifying that they smoked together before he went to the gun range with Kyle.

Today marks the fourth day of the murder trial and, like last week, the families of both Kyle and Littlefield are in the courtroom.

Routh was seen taking notes throughout this morning's testimony. He faces life in prison if he is found guilty. He has entered a not guilty plea and his defense team will be arguing that he was insane at the time of the shooting."

Elite runner Hyvon Ngetich was leading the pack 23 miles into the Austin Marathon this weekend, but then her body just couldn't go any further. Ngetich found herself on all fours, but she refused to accept a wheelchair and crawled the final few miles to the finish line, she told local TV station KHOU.

""You ran the bravest race and crawled the bravest crawl I have ever seen in my life,"" race director John Conley told her afterwards. ""You have earned much honor.""

When asked why she didn't quit, Ngetich, a native of Kenya, said, ""Running, always you have to keep going, going.""

But Dr. Laura Goldberg, a sports medicine specialist at Cleveland Clinic and medical director of the Cleveland Marathon, said sometimes runners just need to stop.

""For the non-elite crowd, there should never be a reason why runner a should crawl to the finish,"" Goldberg said. ""I get nervous about hearing this story, how it translates through the general population.""

She said dehydration, overheating and muscle cramping could have all led Ngetich to crawl to the finish line, but non-elite runners shouldn't follow her example no matter how miraculous her perseverance.

Here's what to look for:

-Your mental status has changed. While it's normal for runners' thinking to change slightly during a marathon due to exhaustion, if you forget where you are or why you're running, stop, Goldberg said. This can be a sign of overheating, an electrolyte problem, dehydration or something else, said Dr. Carl ""Chip"" Lavie, a cardiologist at the Ochsner Center in New Orleans.

-You've stopped sweating or you have chills. This means your body isn't able to regulate its temperature properly. ""Sweat is a way to let off heat,"" Goldberg said.

-Cramping is all over. Runners are used to cramps, but if it's a body-wide feeling, don't push through it, she said.

-Your heart is racing faster than usual. This can be a sign your heart is in trouble, and you could pass out even if you're an elite runner, Lavie said.

-You're experiencing chest pain, shortness of breath or feeling faint. Again, your heart is telling you it's in trouble, and you should stop, he said.

Though distance runners are used to pushing through pain, Lavie said they should recognize when it's time to stop."

On Sunday, core-ISIS officially anointed its Libyan affiliate by releasing a savage new video of camouflage-clad jihadis dramatically slicing the necks of 21 Coptic Christians from Egypt who were abducted in Libya.

The video had similar graphics and cinematic flourishes to ISIS' other major pieces of propaganda from Syria and Iraq, including track and crane camera moves as the victims in orange jumpsuits compliantly knelt in the wet sand of a Mediterranean beach for their final living moments as stars of the Libyan ISIS affiliate's debut.

While ISIS has increasingly been publicizing its presence in Libya -- and worrying many U.S. counter-terrorism officials, who say Western leaders have been too distracted by such hostage execution videos themselves -- the group's expansion is meeting resistance from the clearly dominant jihadi groups there with ties to core-al Qaeda, experts say.

""Because ISIS is so brazen in what they do and their propaganda machine is so prolific with videos like this, it's easy to see where their fighters are and what they're doing,"" Thomas Joscelyn, an ISIS expert and senior fellow at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, told ABC News. ""Al Qaeda and their allies try to hide what they're up to. They don't advertise it with videos.""

Al Qaeda's experienced operatives, whether currently in the group or with experience fighting with them, are plentiful in Libya. Several groups with clear links to al Qaeda in Pakistan were involved with overrunning two U.S. diplomatic and intelligence compounds in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012, which killed four Americans including the ambassador. ISIS is directly challenging them in Libya, Afghanistan, Pakistan, the Sinai and in Yemen.

""The whole Islamic State strategy is to peel away the most extreme among the extremists, the most hardened, violent part of the jihadist world,"" Joscelyn said. ""Al Qaeda, on the other hand, is trying to control and rein in the violence. It's two different models.""

Video Draws Deadly Retaliation

Egypt struck back Monday after ISIS released the video showing the beheading of the 21 Egyptian Coptic Christians. Claiming to target ISIS arms depots and training camps in the east of the country, state TV said Egypt launched airstrikes at dawn in “response to criminal acts of terrorism elements and organizations.”

A spokesperson for Libyan Prime Minister Abdullah al–Thinni, who holds tenuous control over Libya’s internationally recognized government, told the BBC that the Egyptian strikes were part of a coordinated effort with Libya to strike the eastern city of Derna, home to extremists loyal to the Islamic State.

It’s the first attack inside Libya that Egypt has publicly acknowledged -- in spite of accusations from Islamists in Libya that Egypt has carried out strikes on jihadists on behalf of Libya’s air force.

""Eight strikes have been conducted so far. The plan is to target all IS [ISIS] locations in the country wherever they are,"" said Mohamed Bzazh, a Libyan government spokesman.

Libyan Air force commander Saqer al-Joroushi told Reuters that Libyan planes had targeted Sirte and Bin Jawad, and on Egyptian state TV, Joroushi said the strikes had killed “not less than 40 or 50” people.

""What happened now is not the first crime, and it's a clear proof and confirmation of the increasing threat of terrorism in Libya,” Bzazah said.

In the nearly four years since longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi was killed in Libya, the country has been plagued by instability giving birth to opportunist militant groups nationwide and two rival governments, one led by the Libya Dawn movement in Tripoli and the second, headed by al-Thinni, operated out of Bayda and Tobruk.

Libya 'Ripe' for ISIS

Over the last year, the combination of Libya’s civil war breaking out and the rapid rise of ISIS in Syria and Iraq means Libya was “a really ripe opportunity for ISIS seeking to expand,” said Christopher Chivvis, associate director of the International Security and Defense Policy Center and a senior political scientist with the Rand Corporation.

Analysts said jihadis loyal to ISIS began to gain a foothold in the country last fall but burst into the limelight at the end of January when five foreigners, including an American, were killed at Tripoli’s Corinthia Hotel by attackers pledging allegiance to the group led by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

Chivvis said there’s no doubt a relationship exists between the Libyan Islamists and to the core ISIS group, which released the weekend video, “but I would be surprised if it was one of direct command and control -- if these groups were taking orders on specific operations directly.”

“More likely,” he said, ""they’re inspired by the idea of what appears to be the most popular and most gruesome jihadists organization today. ... And it’s clear that ISIS is actively trying to encourage them.”

Last month, ISIS spokesman Abu Muhammad al-Adnani challenged al Qaeda on its home turf by welcoming in an audio speech the pledges of fealty made by some Taliban commanders.

""The factions will assemble against you and the rifles and bayonets will multiply against you. But you are up to it, with Allah’s permission. So unsheathe your swords and take out your spears,"" al-Adnani advised them."

In the suit, which Nina Pham plans to file Monday, the 26-year-old nurse alleges that Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital didn't train the staff to treat Ebola and didn't give them proper protective gear, which left parts of their skin exposed, her lawyer Charla Aldous said.

""One of the most concerning things about the way [the hospital] handled this entire process is you've got a young lady who has this disease which she should not have. And if they properly trained her and given her the proper personal protective equipment to wear, she would not have gotten the disease,"" Aldous said.

""This is not something that Nina chose,"" Aldous said, but ""She's hoping that through this lawsuit she can make it a change for the better for all nurses.""

Pham is still coping with Ebola's after-effects, including nightmares and body aches, her lawyer said.

""She has not gone back to work yet and she is working on recovering,"" Aldous said. ""I don't know if she'll ever be a nurse again.""

Texas Health Resources spokesperson Wendell Watson said in a statement: ""Nina Pham bravely served Texas Health Dallas during a most difficult time. We continue to support and wish the best for her, and we remain optimistic that constructive dialogue can resolve this matter.""

Last fall, Pham cared for Liberian native Thomas Eric Duncan, who flew to the U.S. and was diagnosed with Ebola at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital.

Pham took care of Duncan when he was especially contagious, and on Oct. 8, Duncan died from the virus.

Pham tested positive for Ebola on Oct. 11, marking the first Ebola transmission on U.S. soil.

On Oct. 16, Pham was transferred to the National Institutes of Health's hospital in Bethesda, Maryland. She was discharged on Oct. 24.

At the news conference announcing Pham's discharge, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the NIH, said she tested negative for Ebola five times, and that it wasn't clear which treatment saved her because they were all experimental.

""I want to first tell you what a great pleasure and in many respects, a privilege ... to have the opportunity to treat and care for and get to know such an extremely courageous and lovely person,"" Fauci said, adding that she represents the health care workers who ""put themselves on the line.""

Pham's dog, Bentley, was also quarantined for several weeks, over fears that he, too, would develop Ebola.

17jsHQ0,2015-02-20 00:00:00,ISIS Recruits: 3 Schoolgirls Flee Home to Join Terror Group - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/International/british-police-hunt-teens-headed-join-isis/story?id=29101510,"British Police have issued an urgent appeal looking for three schoolgirls after they were reported missing today, believed to be heading to Syria via Turkey to join Islamist fighters.

The three school friends from East London’s Bethnal Green, ages 15 to 16, left their homes before 8:00 a.m. local time Tuesday and met at Gatwick airport in London where they boarded a Turkish Airlines flight, according to a police news release.

""We are reaching out to the girls using the Turkish media and social media,” Britain’s Counter-Terrorism Commander Richard Walton said, “in the hope that they hear our messages, hear our concerns for their safety and have the courage to return now, back to their families who are so worried about them.""

Should the girls see news reports about themselves, Walton said he hopes they’ll listen to such a “direct appeal.”

“Clearly if these three girls travel to Syria, they’re in grave danger,” he said. “We are aware as many people of the treatment of girls and women currently in that part of Syria. You know the prospect is not good and we want to prevent them from getting there.”

Statements attributed to one major terror group in the region, ISIS, purportedly described the way its fighters treat women -– from buying and selling young girls as slaves to justifying rape of “non-believers.”

The U.S Senior Adviser for Foreign Fighters, Ambassador Thomas Krajeski, said during a news briefing today that young girls traveling to Syria and Iraq were being considered as problematic as those traveling to fight.

“Fighters include people not only picking up a gun, but also going to support Islamists, in some way, including young women who have been attracted to the fight for various reasons and in some cases children,” he said, adding the prospect of fighters returning to their home countries to conduct attacks is of “great concern.”

Krajeski also acknowledged the difficulty of controlling the Turkish-Syrian border. “This is a very difficult border to police,” he said. “The most effective way to do it is to provide border officials with the best possible information. I believe Turks are committed to increasing checks and controls of incoming travelers and border controls.”

At the Scotland Yard briefing, officials said the case of the three missing girls was related to one concerning another 15-year-old girl who was stopped by police in December while allegedly trying to get to Syria to join ISIS. Officials said the three missing girls were friends with the 15-year-old."
17KzbHW,2015-03-03 00:00:00,'Sound of Music' 50th Anniversary: The Real von Trapps Reflect on the Iconic Film - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/sound-music-50th-anniversary-real-von-trapps-reflect/story?id=29272951,"""The Sound of Music"" turns 50 today and is still just as iconic as ever, decades after Julie Andrews starred as Maria in the 1965 classic.

""What blows my mind is how much it's continued and how much people still value the story,"" Myles von Trapp Derbyshire, 30, told ABC News. ""And the people that I meet, how much it's affected their lives. It's great to be part of a story that's proven itself to be timeless.""

Myles is the great-grandson of Maria von Trapp, one of the main, real-life inspirations for the movie, and believes her story ""is about being strong and facing adversity head on.""

""Here we are 50 years later and people are still interested,"" he added. ""Lady Gaga is performing at the Oscars and it's still relevant.”

In the classic movie, Maria leaves a convent during World War II and falls in love with Captain Georg von Trapp. The family, including the children, leave Austria during the war to escape the Nazis.

The film also focuses on the family's musical gifts and occupation as traveling singers. Maria von Trapp, who died in 1987, was the matriarch of the Trapp Family Singers.

Since ""The Sound of Music"" is based on a true story, Myles recalls the times he would visit the actual Trapp Family Lodge in Stowe, Vermont, and how that family landmark came about.

""After they came to the U.S., they were broke, because they had to leave everything behind in Austria,"" Myles told ABC News. ""They decided on Vermont, it reminded them most of Austria with the green mountains and all. They bought a farm and turned that into music camp.""

While Myles may not have too many memories of his great-grandmother, his mother, Stephanie, 55, remembers Maria.

""She was my grandmother,"" she told ABC News. ""[We would visit] once a year. We would go for a family trip to the Trapp Family Lodge, which was her house. It was a big deal, because we would get out of school early! And we'd have a ball.""

With the von Trapp family being the inspiration for the Oscar-winning film, some elements were exaggerated for dramatic effect.

""The whole relationship with Rolf was added, that did not exist,"" he said of one of the von Trapp children having a relationship with a young Nazi in the movie. ""He's a made-up character. My grandfather was actually the eldest child. So the relationship there with one of the Nazis didn't exist. They didn't climb every mountain, they hopped on a train to Italy when it came to the Nazis pursuing my great-grandfather.""

He added, ""The house itself [in Austria, which was a mansion in the film] was not this grand, huge thing. They lived very humbly for several years before they left Austria and came to the US. ... The personalities of Georg and Maria are also actually reversed.

“My great-grandfather was very sweet and kind, Maria was apparently very moody,"" he said, laughing.

Stephanie says Maria “wasn't your snugly grandmother, but she was fun. I'll never forget, she wanted to take us to the local soft serve ice cream place. She was trying to describe how tall the ice cream cone was and she was very excited. She took us in her convertible Volkswagen Karmann Ghia. We got ice cream and I just remember that was awesome.”

What the movie got exactly right was ""they did sing, stuff about my great-grandfather Georg and him being a naval captain, and being knighted is all true.""

Myles von Trapp Derbyshire

Myles doesn't remember the first time he saw it but has an amazing memento that he cherishes.

""There's a picture of me sitting on my grandfather's lap watching the movie when I was 4 years old,"" he said. ""You can see Julie Andrews dancing through the mountains and me on his lap.""

Stephanie von Trapp Derbyshire

Stephanie remembers, and though she's excited now, at 5 years old, she admits she ""didn't get it.""

""I remember going to the theater. I remember thinking, 'Why was this so special?' I didn't quite connect the fact that we were von Trapps and the people in the movie were von Trapps. I didn't get that,"" she said."

A 75-year-old woman's ex-husband surprised her when he proposed to her again after being divorced for 43 years.

The Valentine's Day proposal happened at the Fort Smith, Arkansas, Walmart, where the woman works.

Walmart employee Renate Stumpf can be seen on video being surprised from behind by her ex-husband-now-fiance Louis Demetriades.

""Hey, good-looking,"" Demetriades greeted her while carrying a sign that read, ""Happy Valentine's Day! Will you marry me?""

Stumpf declined the offer at first to tease him, she told ABC News today .

""Forty-three years is a long time, so I wasn't sure at first,"" she said, ""but I will marry him though because he's changed for the better, I've come to realize.""

She added that this was the best Valentine's Day she has ever had and that the proposal ""knocked her socks off.""

Demetriades did not immediately respond to ABC News' calls for comment.

The two first met at an army base in Germany when they were both 18.

""I was working in the kitchen at the army base, and he was a soldier,"" Stumpf said. ""The first time I ever saw him, he asked me if I could fix him a hamburger. He liked who he saw, so he asked to go help me out in the kitchen.""

She told him to get out because she didn't need help, but he kept on coming back and a romantic relationship ensued, Stumpf added.

The two of them had three children together and had a difficult life when they moved to the United States, Stumpf said.

""We had little financial support, I didn't know anything and I could barely speak English,"" she said. ""We started arguing about every little thing.""

After about 13 years of marriage, they divorced, Stumpf said. They eventually remarried, but both their second spouses have recently died.

The two reconnected in December, Stumpf said, after her ""stubborn husband"" tried to get a hold of their daughter through Facebook and called the Walmart to rekindle a friendship.

""When we saw each other again last December, we knew right then we still loved each other for sure,"" Stumpf said. ""That love has never passed.""

The two were thinking about doing the civil wedding today, and a church wedding later, Stumpf told ABC News, but they decided to wait a little and just enjoy each other's company for a bit.

""There's no rush at my age,"" Stumpf said. ""God put us together again, and it couldn't be any other way after all these years."""
17LfLDp,2015-02-17 00:00:00,Federal Judge in Texas Blocks President Obama's Executive Action on Immigration - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/federal-judge-texas-blocks-president-obamas-executive-action/story?id=29011861,"A federal judge in Texas has blocked President Obama's executive action on immigration, giving Texas and 25 other states time to pursue a lawsuit that aims to permanently stop the orders.

U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen’s decision comes after a hearing in Brownsville, Texas, in January and puts on hold Obama’s order, which could protect millions of immigrants who are here illegally from being deported.

Hanen wrote in a memorandum accompanying his ruling that the lawsuit should go forward and that without a preliminary injunction the states will ""suffer irreparable harm in this case.""

""The genie would be impossible to put back into the bottle,"" he wrote, adding that he agreed with the plaintiffs' argument that legalizing the presence of millions of people is a ""virtually irreversible"" action.

The White House released a statement Tuesday criticizing the judge’s decision.

“The Supreme Court and Congress have made clear that the federal government can set priorities in enforcing our immigration laws—which is exactly what the President did when he announced commonsense policies to help fix our broken immigration system. Those policies are consistent with the laws passed by Congress and decisions of the Supreme Court, as well as five decades of precedent by presidents of both parties who have used their authority to set priorities in enforcing our immigration laws,” the statement reads.

“The Department of Justice, legal scholars, immigration experts, and the district court in Washington, D.C. have determined that the President’s actions are well within his legal authority. Top law enforcement officials, along with state and local leaders across the country, have emphasized that these policies will also benefit the economy and help keep communities safe. The district court’s decision wrongly prevents these lawful, commonsense policies from taking effect and the Department of Justice has indicated that it will appeal that decision.”

Cesar Vargas and Erika Andiola, co-directors of the Dream Action Coalition, a political and lobbying voice in immigration issues, also issued a statement saying they weren’t surprised by the judge’s decision.

“The injunction is clearly based more on politics than law, and is now part of an aggressive effort by the rightward fringe of the GOP to scare Dreamers and parents from applying,” the statement reads. “Nevertheless, we will not let this temporary obstacle stop us from holding forums, encouraging people to collect their paperwork and eventually apply; this injunction is only temporary after all.”

The first of Obama’s orders protecting young undocumented immigrants was set to start taking effect Wednesday.

The sites shut down include some of the most important distributors of ISIS messages in a major escalation against ISIS’s propaganda and recruitment efforts, according to J.M. Berger, a terrorism analyst who monitors ISIS online messaging.

""Twitter has been doing a whole lot over the past week. They've slammed them pretty hard, including the official media distribution guys,"" Berger said. He said 13 of the 16 major ISIS distribution accounts were among those shut down.

Top U.S. security officials previously said ISIS has successfully leveraged social media networks, including Twitter, as powerful recruitment tools to draw in fighters from 90 countries. But a person with knowledge of Twitter’s recent suspension spree said it was not done due to U.S. government pressure -– in fact, he said the U.S. intelligence community would prefer the accounts stay open for intelligence gathering purposes.

Instead, the suspensions have been a result of increased media reporting, which in turn spurred public awareness, which has created more user-generated policy violation reports, the person said. It’s against Twitter’s policy, for instance, to make direct, specific threats of violence against others.

The assault on ISIS social media was followed by an apparent threat Monday by supporters of the Syria-based network responsible for killing thousands of innocents while establishing an Islamic ""caliphate"" from Syria to Iraq and elsewhere. The message posted online called out Twitter founder Jack Dorsey by name and used his photo.

The Twitter spokesperson would only say that the company's security team was ""investigating the veracity of these threats with relevant law enforcement officials,"" and that content is constantly reviewed against Twitter's rules.

The sultry Mae West was considered a sex symbol in Hollywood for her steamy scenes with male actors. But the blonde bombshell's 1933 film “I’m No Angel” with Cary Grant set off a firestorm that changed how sex was portrayed in movies for decades.

The year after “I’m No Angel” was a box office smash, the production code, which included “do’s and don’ts” and “be careful’s” for actors and filmmakers, became mandatory in Hollywood as a way to censor films.

The code listed dozens of red flags, but here are just some of things it restricted:

1. Nudity, even in silhouette, was banned.

2. Showing or talking about divorce or adultery in an attractive light was banned.

3. Most curse words were banned.

4. Kisses couldn't be ""lustful."" They couldn't last more than three seconds.

5. Lovers weren't allowed to be horizontal. One partner had to keep one foot on the floor at all times.

6. Beds were not allowed to accommodate more than one person.

7. Even actors portraying married couples had to be shown sleeping in separate beds.

West’s Hollywood film career never recovered after the code was instituted, and within a year after ""I'm No Angel"" was released, the studios introduced a new leading lady: Shirley Temple.

Honest sexuality didn't return to the big screen until studios abandoned the code in 1968. They instead adopted the more permissive advisory rating system, which allowed nudity and casual sex to be portrayed on screen. A form of it is still in use today.

Six months after the new rating system was adopted, the X-rated 1969 film “Midnight Cowboy” was released in theaters.

Oh, how far we’ve come."

The Svalbard Global Seed Vault, more than 807 miles beyond the Arctic Circle in mountainous permafrost, is the ""world's largest, secure seed storage vault."" Since the vault opened in February 2008, crates of seeds are sent there ""for safe and secure long-term storage in cold and dry rock vaults,"" according to a statement from the Norwegian government.

""The aim of back-up of our collection at Svalbard is to conserve viable African rice diversity forever and available for research for the next generation of scientists,"" Marie Noelle Ndjiondjop, head of AfricaRice genetic resources unit, told ABC News.

The first boxes of Nordic forest tree seeds (Norway spruce and Scots pine) were also stored in the vault. In addition to conservation, the purpose of storing the seeds is to monitor changes in genetic diversity and breeding operations, according to the Norwegian government.

So far, 218 seed lots from the Norwegian Forest Seed Center have been selected for the Svalbard seed vault. The oldest one, a pine sample from Tranøy in Norway, is from 1938, the government said.

Nordic cooperation provided the long-term storage of forest tree seeds, including Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Iceland and Norway.

The 27-year-old mother of two was diagnosed with stage IV cancer shortly after the holidays. At first, doctors thought it was lymphoma, which would have been curable. But they soon learned they didn't know where the cancer originated, and it was aggressive, she wrote.

They gave her six months to live without treatment, she wrote on her blog. If she underwent chemotherapy, she could have five years.

""I was doing the math in my head about how old they [her children] would be when I was supposed to die and I just -- it broke my heart,"" she told ABC's Charleston, South Carolina, affiliate WCIV-TV.

Her daughter is 6 and her son is 6 months old. WCIV was there when photographers snapped their first official family portrait as a family of four. Cox said she was hoping to do it before her hair fell out, but she was bald and beautiful for the cameras.

Since Cox started her blog a week ago, more than 12,000 people have viewed the posts about her journey with stage IV cancer. She writes that she hopes to renew others' faith in God through her experience and that she's praying for a miracle.

""I want people to realize how precious life is and how quickly it can be taken away from us,"" she wrote in a post. ""I want them to value their time on this earth with their families. I want them to hug their children a little tighter. I want them to believe in miracles, because I will get my miracle."""
17OYb0U,2015-03-03 00:00:00,Hillary Clinton's State Department Email: What We Know About Her Use of a Private Account - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/hillary-clintons-state-department-email-private-account/story?id=29352617,"Hillary Clinton used a private email account to communicate while serving as secretary of state, The New York Times revealed.

Clinton's team has confirmed that she used a personal email account for government business but maintained that it worked within ""both the letter and the spirit"" of State Department rules. An aide later added that Clinton did not violate any laws and her team has turned over all relevant emails to the State Department for preservation.

The Times reported that she did not have a government email account, which would have ended with a federal government domain -- in this case, state.gov. Such emails are automatically stored on government servers and kept as federal records.

The domain ""clintonemail.com"" was registered the week before she was sworn in as secretary of state in 2009, The Washington Post reported -- but Clinton's team has not confirmed that she used an email at that address.

There hasn't been enough information released yet to determine exactly what rules were broken, if any, but there are clear disclosure and security concerns.

Government email accounts have their messages automatically stored as part of the Federal Records Act, and while it's clear that Clinton's personal account would not have fallen under that umbrella, her team noted that much of her correspondence still was covered, as a result.

""For government business, she emailed them on their department accounts, with every expectation they would be retained,"" Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill said in a statement.

However, as The Times noted, emails to accounts outside the U.S. government would not be covered by the same rules.

Did Hillary Clinton violate federal rules by using only her personal email account as sec of state? My @GMA report: http://t.co/4F8YvPjiqq

Clinton's team now has gone through her personal emails and forwarded any dealing with official business to the State Department for preservation, White House spokesman Josh Earnest reiterated during the daily White House news briefing today.

Earnest deferred numerous questions about the propriety of Clinton's private email use to State Department officials.

Spokeswoman Jen Psaki said that the State Department ""has long had access to a wide array"" of Clinton's records, including emails to people using state.gov accounts as well as diplomatic cables, but she did not explicitly address emails that Clinton sent that involved non-governmental accounts.

Another spokeswoman, Marie Harf, said there was “no prohibition” on using personal email for government business as long as it was preserved. However, she could not say with confidence that Clinton provided the State Department with every relevant email from her personal account.

Harf said no classified business was conducted on Clinton’s email.

We don't know the extent of the security measures taken with her external account and whether they matched the measures taken by her colleagues who used government email accounts. Government accounts have their messages encrypted, for instance.

Harf could not say Clinton’s emails were secure. Asked how the department could guarantee their security, she said, “I don’t know, you’d have to ask her [Clinton].”

According to Merrill, Clinton's spokesman, no. He said that ""secretaries of state before her"" also used their own email accounts while ""engaging with department officials."" That response, however, did not specify whether those secretaries of state used both government and private email accounts or just private email accounts like Clinton did, and it didn't specify whether those secretaries of state were operating under earlier sets of rules governing government employees' email conduct.

Without naming names, a senior state department official reiterated Merrill's claims that Clinton's predecessors practiced a similar private email policy.

""It is our understanding that secretaries prior to Secretary Kerry didn't regularly use an official State Department account,"" the senior state department official told ABC News.

However, two prior secretaries of state either exclusively used government email or used no email at all, and a third avoided private email for classified matters, sources close to them told ABC News.

An official close to Condoleezza Rice, who led the State Department for three years preceding Clinton under George W. Bush, said Rice never used a personal email account for State Department business.

Peggy Cifrino, a spokesman for Colin Powell, the prior secretary of state, said the emails he did send from a personal account were mostly unclassified in nature and that his office has pledged to hand over any required emails in keeping with new policies designed to track electronic communications from senior government officials.

A former State Department official close to Madeline Albright, who preceded Powell as secretary of state in the late '90s, said she didn't use email at all.

The New York Times reported that Clinton's use of a personal account was first discovered during a House committee's investigation into the 2012 attack on the American consulate in Benghazi, Libya. However, the State Department apparently just handed over a selection of about 300 emails to the committee two weeks ago.

Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the ranking Democrat on the Benghazi Select Committee, issued a statement this morning saying that it has been known ""for several years that Secretary Clinton used her personal email account, apparently following the pattern of previous secretaries of state.""

On top of that, anyone who received an email from her after she took over the State Department in 2009 would have recognized at the time that they were receiving an email from a non-state.gov address.

To quote another famous female politician, you betcha. Though Clinton has not yet announced her candidacy, her likely opponent, Jeb Bush, has already slammed her secretive move, saying that it lacked transparency.

Transparency matters. Unclassified @HillaryClinton emails should be released. You can see mine, here. http://t.co/wZbtwd8O2j

Working together, scientists at the University of Washington and the University of Johannesburg in South Africa found evidence that life may have thrived on Earth 3.2 billion years ago, upending the belief that Earth's atmosphere at the time was uninhabitable.

The study is based on an analysis of 52 rock samples collected in South Africa and northwestern Australia and range in age from 2.75 to 3.2 billion years old.

Roger Buick, a University of Washington professor and co-author of the article that was published Monday in the journal Nature, said the rock samples his team analyzed showed that there was plentiful nitrogen 3.2 billion years ago to sustain the most basic life forms, including bacteria, viruses and other organisms.

While life can exist without oxygen, nitrogen is an essential building block for genes.

""People always had the idea that the really ancient biosphere was just tenuously clinging on to this inhospitable planet, and it wasn't until the emergence of nitrogen fixation that suddenly the biosphere become large and robust and diverse,"" Buick told UW Today."

Based in truth, however, does not always mean how it actually went down in real life. As with any film, biopics are subject to the director's interpretation of events.

This year's slew of based-on-a-true-story nominees are no exception. In fact, several of them have drawn controversy precisely for their interpretation.

Here's a quick primer on what you'll find in each of the best picture nominees based on a true story.

Selma

The first Martin Luther King Jr., biopic to hit the big screen, ""Selma"" deals with the period around the three marches led by King from Selma to Montgomery that paved the way for the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Though it opens with King accepting the Nobel Peace Prize in December 1964 and covers just a few short months through the marches in March 1965, the film manages to convey the scope of the Civil Rights Movement.

What you won't see in the film are King's original speeches, since King's estate did not give permission to the filmmakers to use them. Instead, they are connected to an upcoming film project by Steven Spielberg. Working with an original script by Paul Webb, director Ava DuVernay carefully paraphrased King, so that the speeches star David Oyelowo delivers in the film have King’s rhythm and meaning, even though they are not his actual words.

The film has been criticized by some, notably Lyndon B. Johnson's former aide Joseph Califano Jr., for the way it depicts the former president as sometimes impeding the movement.

""They had one of the most productive relationships in history, but it was sometimes a rocky road to get there,"" DuVernay told ""60 Minutes."" ""It happened. It was a triumphant time for our country but we tried to show the complexity and the humanity within their relationship.""

The Imitation Game

""The Imitation Game"" tells the story of British mathematician Alan Turing, who helped defeat the Nazis by cracking their codes. The film focuses on Turing's code-breaking work and how he was later prosecuted for being gay under a law that criminalized homosexuality in the United Kingdom.

Though the script is based on Andrew Hodges’ ""Alan Turing: The Enigma,"" the film portrays Turing, played by Oscar nominee Benedict Cumberbatch, as indifferent and unapproachable, which is not how friends and colleagues remembered him in the book. The film also depicts Turing as keeping his homosexuality a closely guarded secret, but in reality he was open with friends and colleagues and, according to the book, often made advances at other men.

The biggest liberty the film takes is suggesting that Turing was accused of being a traitor by not turning in a Soviet spy who threatens to expose his homosexuality. Hodges said in real life the two never met and their relationship was invented by filmmakers, which, some say, have tarnished Turing's reputation."

He swirled his glass, sniffed, and took a sip, as if he were taste-testing a fine wine.

But Schneider isn’t a sommelier.

He’s a water judge.

“You can just kind of tell as it goes down, which one feels good, which one’s nourishing,” said Schneider, one of three white-coated judges at the 16th annual “Great American Water Taste Test” in Washington, D.C.

As for the theatrics – “That was mostly for effect,” he admits with a laugh.

Each year, a three-person panel selected by the Natural Rural Water Association assesses samples of America’s finest drinking water based on three criteria: taste, clarity and bouquet.

In the blind taste test, what seems to matter most is “crispness.”

Each judge sipped five different water samples served in wine glasses and carried in on a silver platter. Between swallows, the judges nibbled on saltine crackers as a “palate cleanser.”

“We come into it with a lot of experience, drinking lots of water from sources over the course of our lives,” joked Schneider, who also works for the House Agriculture Committee. “This will certainly make my LinkedIn resume!”

But the judges were there to judge and decisions had to be made.

Their unanimous favorite was the H2O from Easthampton, Massachusetts. Second and third place went to Whittier, Alaska and Buhl, Idaho, respectively.

""I’m really proud of this,” Tom Newton, supervisor of Easthampton Water Works, told ABC News. “I’ve put 40 years of my life into this. I’m retiring this year. This is the victory lap.”"

Considering the vast abyss of space, this was a close encounter. At its nearest point, the newly discovered Scholz's star was believed to have been 0.8 light years from the solar system -- that's about 5 trillion miles.

The only other star that has ever gotten closer to Earth is the sun. Scholz's star and the sun are now 20 light years apart, according to astronomers at the University of Rochester. The findings were published in Astrophysical Journal Letters and were a collaboration from a team spanning the globe.

Eric Mamajek from the University of Rochester and the group closely studied the velocity and the path of the dim star.

""The small tangential motion and proximity initially indicated that the star was most likely either moving towards a future close encounter with the solar system, or it had 'recently' come close to the solar system and was moving away,"" he said in a statement.

""Sure enough, the radial velocity measurements were consistent with it running away from the Sun's vicinity -- and we realized it must have had a close flyby in the past."""

The former rapper, whose real name is Robert Van Winkle, was booked into the Palm Beach County Jail, and charged with burglary residence and grand theft, according to a Chief Sean Scheller at the Lantana Police Department. He was released from jail tonight.

Van Winkle spoke to West Palm Beach, Florida, ABC affiliate WPBF. ""It's just out of proportion I wish you guys would focus on the good things I've done,"" he told the station. Asked if the incident is part of his reality show, he laughed and said, ""I wish it was--there's nothing fun about this. I wish everyone the best and maybe the good news will travel this fast.""

In December, the police investigated a burglary at a home near a residence Van Winkle has been renovating. According to authorities, the missing items -- which included furniture, a pool heater, bicycles and other items -- were found at Van Winkle's property and later returned to the owner.

Scheller told ABC News that Van Winkle was cooperating with investigators.

A rep for Van Winkle did not respond to a request for comment.

Van Winkle, who is perhaps best known for his hit song, ""Ice Ice Baby,"" has a home renovation show on the DIY Network, ""The Vanilla Ice Project.

It was unclear whether this property is affiliated with the show."

Sacks, a professor of neurology at New York University School of Medicine, said in a New York Times article that cancer had been found in his liver nine years after he was first diagnosed with a rare ocular tumor.

The doctor wrote that the initial treatment for the tumor in his eye left him partially blind and noted that most tumors of this kind do not metastasize.

""I am among the unlucky 2 percent,"" he wrote for the New York Times. ""I feel grateful that I have been granted nine years of good health and productivity since the original diagnosis, but now I am face to face with dying.""

Sacks, 81, is best known for his writing on neurological case histories including ""The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat"" and an ""An Anthropologist on Mars."" His book ""Awakenings,"" based on his work in the 1960s with patients who were unable to initiate movement, was turned into an Oscar-nominated movie of the same name starring Robin Williams and Robert De Niro.

Sacks, whose biography will be released this spring, wrote that he feels ""intensely alive"" after his diagnosis.

""Over the last few days, I have been able to see my life as from a great altitude, as a sort of landscape, and with a deepening sense of the connection of all its parts,"" he wrote. ""This does not mean I am finished with life.""

While the famed doctor plans to give up following ""politics or arguments about global warming,"" he said he feels the world is being left in good hands.

""I cannot pretend I am without fear. But my predominant feeling is one of gratitude,"" he wrote. ""Above all, I have been a sentient being, a thinking animal, on this beautiful planet, and that in itself has been an enormous privilege and adventure."""
17Wstik,2015-03-06 00:00:00,"Signing Up for a Mission to Mars, and Planning to Never Return - ABC News",http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/signing-mission-mars-planning-return/story?id=29392141,"Kellie Gerardi is training for the mission of her life, one from which she might never return.

Gerardi is one of thousands of applicants vying for a trip to Mars, courtesy of an audacious new company called Mars One.

Only 100 potential astronauts will be finalists, but there’s a pretty massive catch: It’s a one-way ticket.

Despite the no-return clause, Mars One said 200,000 people from around the world, including Gerardi, have applied to leave everything on Earth behind.

“I know for a fact that no matter what, in my lifetime, I’m going to space,” said Gerardi, who is newly engaged.

The 26-year-old Florida native trained for the mission in the rocky plains of remote Utah, where she spent three weeks at the Mars Society’s Desert Research Station to learn what it takes for humans to survive on Mars, from moving and breathing in a space suit, to eating bizarre cuisines like zebra tarantulas, because bugs would be a food source on Mars.

The commercial space industry has boomed in recent years, with companies like Space-X and Virgin Galactic building their own rockets and spaceships in an effort to make outer space available to everyone who wants to go.

And it’s not just for sport. Some scientists believe settling other planets is the best hope for human survival.

And when it comes to colonizing Mars, Bas Landorp, the 37-year-old CEO of Mars One, and his team of space experts claim they can do what NASA, so far, has not.

“Accept the new reality,” Landorp said. “Literally everybody on the globe will be watching, just like when Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed on the moon.”

“We’re hiring the established aerospace companies from all over the world to design the systems, to build them, to test them, but no new inventions are needed to implement our program,” he added.

But while Landorp said the technology exists to get people to Mars, his company does not have the technology to bring people back to Earth, so the plan is to form a permanent colony with new crews arriving each year.

Of course there are extreme hurdles to overcome. Mars is about 200 million miles away from Earth, which translates to at least seven months of space travel to get there -- and no one has ever been there before.

But for people like Kellie Gerardi, the unknowns are not scary, just part of the dream.

“I think either you get it or you don't,” she said. “I would equate it almost to seeing Mt. Everest for the first time. Here is this hostile challenging environment, and either you feel a yearning to climb it or you don't. And if you don't, I don't know if--that I could ever explain that to you.”

Gerardi is planning her wedding, but says getting married won’t stop her from leaving Earth and her fiancee is supportive of her decision.

“Everyone makes the joke to us, ‘til Mars do us part,’” she said. “I'm getting married next year. I couldn't be more excited. I couldn't be more in love. Do I still see myself going to space in the future? Yes… I would go, and that's a hard reality.”

Another Mars One hopeful is Sue Ann Pien, a 35-year-old tech worker from Los Angeles. She said finding out she was a potential candidate “changed the entire trajectory” of her life, and she started a sort of Earth bucket list.

“I just took off and I went and I experience amazing things around the world that I wanted to do,” Pien said. “I was going up volcanoes in Bali and scuba diving.”"
17YKbBy,2015-03-08 00:00:00,Daylight Saving Time 2015: Tips for Springing Forward - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Health/daylight-saving-time-2015-tips-springing-forward/story?id=29424357,"Daylight saving time 2015 will begin on Sunday, March 8 at 2:00 a.m. That means it's time to spring forward, but the sweet act of moving the clocks an hour ahead can deliver a blow to your sleeping schedule

For most, daylight saving time is an exciting sign of spring that comes with a slightly sleepy Monday. But if you're not a morning person to begin with, your mood and productivity can take a dive. Daylight saving time has been blamed for car accidents, workplace injuries and stock market dips in the past.

That's because people are experiencing more than just jet lag this time of year. They're dealing with a new light-dark cycle.

""It's an interesting paradox, because traveling one time zone east or west is very easy for anyone to adapt to,"" said Dr. Alfred Lewy, director of Oregon Health and Science University's Sleep and Mood Disorders Laboratory in Portland, Oregon. ""But in daylight saving time, the new light-dark cycle is perversely working against the body clock. We're getting less sunlight in morning and more in the evening.""

The body clock is a cluster of neurons deep inside the brain that generates the circadian rhythm, also known as the sleep-wake cycle. The cycle spans roughly 24 hours, but it's not precise.

""It needs a signal every day to reset it,"" said Lewy.

The signal is sunlight, which shines in through the eyes and ""corrects the cycle from approximately 24 hours to precisely 24 hours,"" said Lewy. But when the sleep-wake and light-dark cycles don't line up, people can feel out-of-sync, tired and downright grumpy.

With time, the body clock adjusts on its own. But here are a few ways to help it along.

Getting some early morning sun Saturday and Sunday can help the brain's sleep-wake cycle line up with the new light-dark cycle. But it means getting up and outside at dawn. Sleeping by a window won't cut it, Lewy said. The sunlight needs to be direct because glass filters out much of the frequencies involved in re-setting the sleep-wake cycle.

Resisting the urge to linger in the late sunlight Sunday and Monday also can help the body clock adjust, Lewy said.

While light synchronizes the body clock in the morning, the hormone melatonin updates it at night.

The exact function of the hormone, produced by the pea-size pineal gland in the middle of the brain, is unclear. But it can activate melatonin receptors on the neurons of the body clock, acting as a ""chemical signal for darkness,"" Lewy said.

Taking a low-dose (less than 0.3 milligrams) of melatonin late in the afternoon Friday through Monday can help sync the sleep-wake and light-dark cycles. But be careful: Though melatonin is sold as a dietary supplement, it can cause drowsiness and interfere with other drugs.

Authorities are investigating the death of Ahmed Al-Jumaili, 36, who was killed in the parking lot of an apartment complex late Wednesday night.

Al-Jumaili only moved to America three weeks ago, according to a fundraising page set up by friends.

The Dallas Police Department said that the shooting took place at 11:40 p.m., when Al-Jumaili and his wife were taking photos of the snow. He was transported to a nearby hospital, where he died.

According to ABC affiliate WFAA, witnesses told police that a group of men randomly started firing a gun and some nearby cars were also hit.

Crimestoppers offered $5,000 for information that leads to an arrest.

The fundraising appeal tells the love story of Al-Jumaili and his wife, Zahara, who got married 16 months ago. At the time, they lived in Iraq -- but Zahara made the “painful” decision to move to America and live with her relatives in “what she believed to be a safer place,” the site said.

Less than a month ago, the site added, Al-Jumaili, who stayed in Iraq “to continue working and save finances” reunited with his wife in Dallas.

“It is heartbreaking to know that Zahara won't get to experience life's milestones with her Ahmed. Hard to believe that their time together, as husband and wife, started just 16 months ago, and has now tragically ended so suddenly,” the fundraising site said."

But what is it?

#BlackOutDay is a social media campaign today celebrating black beauty and fighting against negative images and stereotypes perpetuated in the media, YouTube personality Franchesca Ramsey told ABC News today.

Oh my soul. RT@RwhoweR: Why #BlackOutDay is important. pic.twitter.com/ouqzk0gIev

""We're asking black people to share pictures, videos and GIFs of themselves to celebrate our people coming from all different walks of life,"" Ramsey said. ""It's a celebration of black beauty and our individuality.

""Unfortunately, in most popular media talking about black people and our bodies, it's mostly of us breaking the law, being killed or mistreated,"" Ramsey added. ""So it's nice to combat these negative images and stereotypes with positive representations of ourselves.""

A Tumblr friend reached out to Ramesy, she said,  to help promote the social media event created by someone named T'von under the Tumblr username ""expect-the-greatest.""

Other ""Tumblr-famous"" bloggers like V. Matthew King-Yarde, who runs ""WhatWhitesWillNeverKnow,"" helped spread awareness to make sure the campaign would go viral. Yarde also created a logo for the campaign, he said, while fellow friend Marissa Sebastian came up with the hashtag.

Official #BlackOutDay masterpost - Q & A and FAQ, written by event organizers & hashtag originators http://t.co/RPvdzyulEK

T'von was inspired to propose the campaign after feeling like he never saw regular black people being celebrated on his Tumblr dashboard, he wrote on Tumblr.

""I’m really sick and tired of seeing the 'European standard of beauty' prevail,"" he said. ""It’s past time for the beauty of black people to be showcased.""

Why we DONT EVER need #WhiteOutDay pic.twitter.com/Kl1Vx4suEb

""Black History Month is always excellent, but one month isn’t enough to celebrate our heritage and our beauty,"" T'von added of February. ""[...] ALL black people are beautiful and worthy of praise and admiration, and Blackout day is a step towards that.”

Ramsey loved the message T'von wants to send, she said, adding that there's limited representation of black women particularly in entertainment and fashion.

The state's Department of Justice's Division of Criminal Investigation is investigating the Friday shooting of Tony Robinson, officials said today. Wisconsin law requires an outside agency to investigate officer-involved shootings.

""We all deserve to know the facts in this case,"" Madison Mayor Paul Soglin said in a statement Saturday. ""Tony Robinson's family deserves that, our community deserves that, and the Madison Police deserve that. When the answers come, we will be open and transparent in communicating them.""

Robinson, 19, was jumping in and out of traffic on Friday night and allegedly responsible for a recent battery, Madison Police Chief Mike Koval said.

Madison Police Officer Matt Kenny, a 12-year veteran of the department, went to an apartment where he thought Robinson had gone, Koval said. The officer heard a disturbance inside and entered, where an altercation with Robinson began, the police chief said.

Koval said Kenny then shot Robinson, who later died at the hospital.

""Nineteen years old is too young,"" Koval said at a news conference, adding that Robinson was unarmed.

""He was a great kid. He is a great kid,"" said Robinson's grandmother, Sharon Irwin. The family was expected to make a statement during a news conference Saturday afternoon.

Kenny, 45, was also injured, said Koval, but his injuries were not disclosed. The officer was placed on administrative leave with pay pending the outcome of the investigation.

Kenny was involved in a police-involved shooting in 2007 and was exonerated of any wrongdoing, said Koval.

After the Robinson's death, demonstrations condemning the shooting began. A crowd gathered where the shooting happened and then left. Some people then headed to the downtown building that houses the Madison Police Department's Central District offices.

""As a parent, I can only imagine the heartbreak they must be feeling right now in the wake of this tragedy,"" Wisconsin Attorney General Brad Schimel said in a statement. ""Likewise, I am concerned for the officer involved in this incident, who I imagine is experiencing great trauma, as well. They are all in my thoughts and prayers.""

Schimel added that the department will conduct a ""thorough, professional and transparent investigation.""

17ZuBFS,2015-03-09 00:00:00,Ways to Make the Switch to Daylight Saving Time Less Miserable - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Health/ways-make-switch-daylight-saving-time-miserable/story?id=29452350,"You've made it through the endless winter of 2014-15 (almost), and spring is around the corner. The first signpost of the new season arrives in the wee hours of Sunday, March 8, when most of us turn our clocks ahead one hour to inaugurate Daylight Savings Time.

But ""springing forward,"" as fun as it sounds, isn""t all it’s cracked up to be, according to sleep specialist and clinical psychologist Michael Breus, PhD. “Most people actually have a harder time adjusting when we ‘spring forward,’ because we’re losing an hour of sleep,” Breus says. And those of us who are already chronically sleep deprived can’t afford to lose any more. In fact, a survey released this week from the National Sleep Foundation found that, on average, Americans report a sleep debt of about 26 minutes on workdays (that’s the gap between how much shut-eye people say they need and how much they actually get).

But, thankfully, there are steps you can take to make the time change more bearable.

14 Reasons You're Always Tired

""If you’re among the many Americans who are sleep deprived, it probably won’t be difficult for you to fall asleep at the new time,"" Breus says. Just be sure to set your clock ahead before going to sleep on Saturday, March 7. ""That way, seeing the lost hour up front will motivate you to go to bed earlier."" Waiting to change your clocks the next morning and watching that hour disappear can feel like a loss, says Breus.

If you’re among the only marginally sleep deprived, or if you have generally good sleep habits, you can get yourself in gear by pulling back your bedtime incrementally before the time change. “On the Wednesday before the time change, go to bed 15 minutes earlier,"" Breus suggests. ""On Thursday, go to bed another 15 minutes earlier, and another 15 the next two nights so that by Saturday, you’re going to bed an hour early.""

The time change disruption is worse for kids, for whom regular bed times and consistent habits are especially important. ""If they get to stay up until 11pm on Friday night, make it 10pm,"" says Breus. ""Since they’re losing the hour, they need to go to bed earlier."" It’ll pay off come school day.

How to Sleep With Someone Who Snores

You already know that limiting your alcohol intake is generally a smart move, and this weekend in particular, Breus advises capping your nightcap. ""Even though alcohol makes you feel sleepy, it prevents you from reaching those all-important deeper stages of sleep. So if you're already going to be losing an hour of sleep, the last thing you need is poorer quality sleep."" Abstaining may make for less fun on the weekend, but will help you get back in the swing on Monday.

Breus also suggests going easy on the caffeine. If you feel like that cuppa Joe is necessary to jump-start your acclimation, just be sure to stop sipping by 2pm so as not to interfere with your new, earlier bedtime.

The Best and Worst Foods for Sleep

Not all of us have the most flexible work schedules, but Breus advises seeking leniency this one day out of the year. ""Ask your boss if you can come in to work a little late the Monday after the time change, or ask if you can work from home."" For one, this allows you to reap the health benefits of catching up on those all-important lost zzz’s. And if you drive to work, it also allows you to stay off the roads on a particularly hectic and potentially dangerous morning. Research has shown an increase in fatal car accidents on the Monday following the spring time change compared to other Mondays before and after the start of Daylight Savings Time. ""It’s not a bad idea to avoid rush hour on Monday morning when roads will be filled with sleep-deprived people running late for work or school,"" Breus says.

17 Ways Your Job Is Making You Fat

For some folks with a regular fitness routine, switching things up can help you adjust to Daylight Savings Time. ""If exercise chills you out and relaxes you, the extra hour of evening light gives you more opportunity to exercise outdoors,"" Breus says. And regular exercise is a key component to maintaining a healthy sleep schedule. Just remember to preserve a three-hour window between your sweat session and bedtime so you have enough time to wind down, he suggests.

""On the other hand, if you feel energized after your workouts, you should keep doing it in the morning, time change or not, because you don’t want that energy boost to lead to insomnia,” Breus says. You'll just be up in the dark—again.

Susan Ramos, a cousin of the Meyers family, told ABC News that she died at 7:05 p.m. MT.

Meyers was shot Thursday after a confrontation with several people in another vehicle when she was on the way home from giving her daughter a driving lesson at a nearby school, according to the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department.

The other vehicle followed her home, and when she got out of her car, police say someone started shooting.

Meyers' 15-year-old daughter ran into the house before the shooting, and did not witness the incident. Police say one of her brothers came out of the house and fired back at the other vehicle.

The vehicle was described as a four-door gray or silver sedan that may have damage to the front driver's side and may also have been hit by gunfire.

""She had to lose her life for what? I don't understand it and nobody's answered that question,"" Tammy Meyers' husband Robert Meyers said Friday to ABC affiliate KTNV-TV in Las Vegas. ""I don't feel safe, every time you turn around somebody's getting shot.

""This was a mother of four, I loved her, and she was a good woman. And she didn't deserve this because all she's ever done is help people,"" he added.

Family members set up a GoFundMe page to raise money for hospital and funeral expenses.

The page says Meyer’s death was especially painful, coming on Valentine’s Day.

“A day her and her husband cherished every year for the last 25 years where he would always bring her red roses,” it said. “Today, we watched as her husband Robert gave her the last red roses that she will ever receive.”

Sea snails, known as limpets, have microscopic teeth that rival the strength of steel and bulletproof vests, according to a study published in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface.

Known for their conical umbrella-like shells, limpets use their strong teeth, which are fortified with a hard mineral called goethite, to scrape food off of rocks.

While slugs may not seem like the most exciting creatures, Asa Barber, a researcher who worked on the study, said scientists could use the knowledge to create a similar material that could be used on everything from aircraft and boats to dental fillings.

""These teeth are made up of very small fibers, put together in a particular way,"" he told the BBC. ""We should be thinking about making our own structures following the same design principles.""

In what may be the most exciting year ever in science for sea snails, scientists at the University of Utah last month released a study based on sea snails that sheds new light on insulin.

Cone snails have a have a unique high level of insulin in their venom that allow them to render small schools of fish sluggish by either shooting the potent venom into the water or via a harpoon-like sting.

The insulin has just 43 amino acid building blocks, making it shorter than any other known insulin, researchers said, noting that when the insulin mixes with venom, it creates a cocktail that is able to quickly slow down schools of fish and put them in hypoglycemic shock.

Aside from the ick and cool factors of the discovery, researchers said it could also be used to help them better understand how energy is metabolized in humans."

The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department arrested Erich Nowsch, 19, at a house only a block away from where the slain woman, Tammy Meyers, had lived with her family. Meyers' visibly upset husband, Robert Meyers, was standing nearby when the arrest was made after a two-hour standoff and was asked by police to back away from the area.

Police spokesman Christopher Tomaino said Nowsch was believed to be the only shooting suspect in the case but that police were still seeking another person involved.

Robert Meyers told reporters after the arrest that his family knew Nowsch and his late wife had had spent ""countless"" hours trying to help him.

""He knew where we lived,"" he said. ""We knew how bad he was.""

Tomaino said investigators were unaware that Meyers knew Nowsch.

Meyers said his wife and son went looking for Nowsch after the road rage incident because they knew him and where he lived.

Meyers said police have done an ""awesome"" job on the case.

Police revealed this week that Tammy Meyers and her armed son, Brandon, got in a car to look for the driver with whom she had a dispute last Thursday. She had been teaching her 15-year-old daughter how to drive in the parking lot of a nearby school.

After the incident on the road, Tammy Meyers drove home and asked her daughter to tell her 22-year-old son to come to the car. When the mother and son returned home, police said, the suspect's car pulled up. Gunfire erupted and Meyers was fatally wounded.

She died Saturday at the University Medical Center of Southern Nevada.

""The president has been clear that now is not the time for Congress to pass additional legislation on Iran,"" National Security Council spokeswoman Bernadette Meehan told ABC News. ""If this bill is sent to the president, he will veto it.""

Along with Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker, R-Tenn., introduced a bill this week that would allow Congress 60 days to review, and potentially reject, any deal to roll back U.S. nuclear sanctions on Iran.

In a statement issued by his office, Corker called the White House's veto threat ""disappointing.""

The framework for the current negotiations calls for an ultimate deal to ""lift"" nuclear sanctions on Iran, and some observers have concluded that would necessitate an eventual vote from Congress anyway, even if sanctions are only gradually eased in the nearer term.

Negotiations between Iran and world powers including the U.S., UK, France, Germany, Russia, and China have entered their final phase ahead of a March 31 deadline.

Secretary of State John Kerry told The Associated Press the sides had made ""some progress"" after his last meeting with Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif this week."

Cameron Witsman, who was born with a lung defect, became an honorary firefighter on Friday in Eustis, Florida, a town about one hour northwest of Orlando.

Cysts grew in Cameron's lungs before he was born, his mother Caroline Witsman said. The disease is called congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation, Witsman told ABC affiliate WFTV, and when Cameron was four months old, he underwent a double lung transplant.

""If he would not have had the transplant he would not be alive today,"" Witsman said. ""There were quite a few instances where we didn't know, but thank goodness he pulled though all of those.""

Cameron, who has already survived so much, recognizes the importance of serving others; he said what he likes about firefighters is ""helping people.""

So Cameron's new employer, the Eustis Fire Department, put him to the test.

""His dream has always been to be a firefighter,"" said Chief Rex Winn of the Eustis Fire Department. ""And we tried to make that dream come true.""

The 6-year-old was given his own uniform and went to work, shooting down cones with a fire hose and even dragging dummies down the street, all with a huge grin across his face.

""Pretend fires, he runs all these pretend calls at home, so to get this opportunity for him has just been such a blessing, and I'm so thankful,"" his mother said.

""It's just so amazing to see that kind of fire in a young man,"" Winn added. ""That young man's excitement and a dream that we can make happen for him. That's the good part of our job.""

""Cameron wakes up with energy and he never wants to go to sleep at night,"" his mother said. ""He's full of energy, vibrant smart, kindhearted, loves helping people.""

While Cameron's energy is up, he still has a suppressed immune system, according to WFTV, requiring him to be home-schooled and take several medications a day.

""There was a few times where I was called... 'Cameron's doing really bad, I don't think he's going to make it, you need to get here now,'"" Witsman said. ""I can't even put into words how amazing it is that we're here today and we're doing well.""

And the celebrations didn't stop at the fire house. Cameron was the guest of honor at a local parade today, during which he rode on a firetruck and handed out candy.

""It's such a heartwarming feeling. So awesome that they've taken this opportunity to really make his day and make his years,"" Witsman said.

And how did Cameron feel about the new job? ""I'm proud to be a firefighter,"" the 6-year-old said.

18cgYTW,2015-03-12 00:00:00,'Dirty Brigades': US-Trained Iraqi Forces Investigated for War Crimes - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/International/dirty-brigades-us-trained-iraqi-forces-investigated-war/story?id=29193253,"U.S.-trained and armed Iraqi military units, the key to the American strategy against ISIS, are under investigation for committing some of the same atrocities as the terror group, American and Iraqi officials told ABC News. Some Iraqi units have already been cut off from U.S. assistance over ""credible"" human rights violations, according to a senior military official on the Pentagon's Joint Staff.

The investigation, being conducted by the Iraqi government, was launched after officials were confronted with numerous allegations of “war crimes,” based in part on dozens of ghastly videos and still photos that appear to show uniformed soldiers from some of Iraq's most elite units and militia members massacring civilians, torturing and executing prisoners, and displaying severed heads.

“As the ISF [Iraqi Security Forces] and militias reclaim territory, their behavior must be above reproach or they risk being painted with the same brush as ISIL [ISIS] fighters,” said a statement to ABC News from the U.S. government. “If these allegations are confirmed, those found responsible must be held accountable.""

[In an image posted on Instagram, six black-uniformed men who appear to be Iraqi Special Operations Forces from the “Golden Brigades” surround an alleged ISIS suspect who has been dragged with a rope or cable tied to his foot.]

Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, along with international human rights advocates and military experts, called the photos evidence of Iraqi ""war crimes.""

""I guarantee you ultimately we get blamed for it whether we did it or not,"" Leahy predicted.

Under what is known as the Leahy Law, the U.S. is required to cut off funds to any foreign military unit when there is “credible evidence” of human rights violations. In Iraq the responsibility of determination falls to the Department of Defense. In recent Senate testimony, Secretary of State John Kerry confirmed the Iraqi investigation had been ordered and said the Leahy Law applies to units operating alongside the many militias also fighting in Iraq against ISIS.

""I would say that involves the Leahy Law,"" Leahy recently told ABC News after viewing the shocking imagery. “And I'd argue that we should be withholding money.""

According to the Pentagon, the U.S. already has. In a statement to ABC News, the Joint Staff official revealed that in the months since the U.S. began airstrikes and military assistance to Iraq last August, “We have withheld assistance from certain Iraqi units on the basis of credible information in the past. Due to the sensitive nature of our security assistance, we are unable to discuss specific units.”

In Washington today, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Gen. Martin Dempsey told lawmakers the U.S. military is keeping a close eye on the militias as well.

""What we are watching carefully is whether the militias -- they call themselves the popular mobilization forces -- whether when they recapture lost territory, whether they engage in acts of retribution and ethnic cleansing,"" he said.

An Iraqi government spokesperson previously said while the dozens of photos could be ISIS propaganda, a full investigation was warranted.

“Yes, of course we will investigate these pictures,” the spokesperson, Gen. Saad Maan, said in an interview in Baghdad as he viewed a selection of images provided by ABC News.

""We don't have anything to hide,” the general said. “We don't have anything to be in, let's say, in a black corner.""

[A bound and blindfolded detainee appears to be dropped – or possibly hung from the neck according to one analyst -- from what looks like an Iraqi military base guard tower. The image was posted on Instagram.]

The Iraqi military is key to the U.S. strategy to fight ISIS and stop its atrocities, which have outraged the world. The U.S. is shipping almost $1 billion in weapons, as well as providing U.S. military trainers to instruct new Iraqi recruits. A special operations official in Baghdad, however, said it’s the government of Iraq that decides — not the Pentagon — which Iraqi units get U.S.-donated weapons, such as 43,000 M4 rifles and thousands of other light infantry weapons Congress approved for shipment in December. American troops are not known to be operating on the ground in combat in Iraq or Syria. No Americans are shown in the images or footage ABC News has found, nor have any Americans been implicated in any of the alleged atrocities.

Officials from Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International who reviewed the library of horrors assembled in the ABC News investigation said it is rare to see so much visual evidence of human rights abuses.

""Usually when forces commit such crimes they try to hide them. What we are seeing here is a brazen, proud display of these terrible crimes,"" Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East Executive Director at Human Rights Watch, said in an interview as she and the group's lead investigator in Iraq, Erin Evers, surveyed the carnage.

ABC News came upon the first such images last September, when a reporter following personal Instagram accounts of Iraqi counter-terrorism troops spotted a video of a handcuffed prisoner shot in the head by a man in camouflage -- which more than 600 users ""liked."" The English and Arabic captions by a self-identified member of the Iraqi security forces said, “We have arrested this terrorist yesterday and we killed him after completion of interrogation.""

A separate photo posted in September showed the severed head of a long-haired and bearded alleged ISIS fighter lashed to the grill of a U.S.-donated Humvee bearing an Iraqi Army license plate. A second related photo eventually surfaced of what appeared to be an Iraqi Army soldier holding up the same severed head next to the gun truck. Desecration of war dead and extrajudicial killings are violations of the Geneva Conventions.

""You don’t behead someone and place their head on the front of your Humvee. That’s unacceptable -- because it’s a war crime. And it’s an atrocity,"" retired U.S. Army Special Forces Lt. Col. James Gavrilis told ABC News.

As a senior officer in 5th Special Forces Group in Iraq a decade ago, Gavrilis was deeply involved in counterinsurgency during the U.S. war and creating Iraqi counter-terrorism units from Special Forces and special police teams.

""I think it’s horrible. I think this really shows a failure of our policy for Iraq,"" Gavrilis said, confirming that the imagery looked authentic and too plentiful online to be faked.

""Both sides are committing war crimes,"" he said. ""This is widespread, it’s endemic.""

[A man wearing a uniform with a patch that appears to be from the Emergency Response Brigade steps on two severed heads in a photo posted on Instagram.]

In another video posted online in October, two unarmed civilians are shot to death after being questioned, and denying, whether they were part of ISIS. When the camera pans to one man with a gun, he appears to be wearing a uniform and shoulder patch of Iraqi Special Forces, with Iraqi Army officers also nearby observing the atrocity.

Fighters who appear to be a mix of militia and army appearing in a separate 78-second video circulating in January — including some wearing Iraqi flags and Iraqi Special Forces patches — take pictures of a captured teenaged boy who appears terrified. “Didn’t you just shoot?” demands one fighter. The handcuffed boy, shoved to the ground, insists, “No, no, I did not shoot a single bullet.”

The men argue over whether to kill him, some asking the others to calm down, but they shoot him to death anyway as the sound of mortars and gunfire nearby punctuate the crime. “This is to avenge the martyrs,” one man says.

“I've seen all sorts of horrible things over the years... but I have never seen anything this bad in my life,” said Ali Khedery, an American former diplomat in Baghdad who advised five U.S. ambassadors in the Iraqi capital and three generals overseeing Middle East operations at U.S. Central Command.

Khedery recently wrote in Foreign Policy about another video, where a man was beaten and machine gunned to death by a gang who appeared to be both militias and Iraqi Special Forces with U.S.-donated M4A1 rifles. He said the video slaughter of the Iraqis accused by their killers of smuggling weapons for ISIS was far worse, because Iraqi government troops were present.

“It was the shooting of unarmed men. This is a U.S.-backed government. They carried U.S. weapons,” he said.

U.S. and Iraqi authorities say they have been working to fully authenticate the content posted online on sites such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter connected to the Iraqi military. The uniforms and insignia of Iraqi Special Operations Forces under the command of Baghdad’s Counter-Terrorism Forces as well as special police and Emergency Response units from the Ministry of the Interior are clearly identifiable in many of the photos and videos, which include many severed heads and corpses dragged behind humvees.

Gen. Maan, the Iraqi government spokesperson, claimed the patches identifying Iraqi military units could be bought on Iraqi streets and that the gruesome images could be a clever ploy by ISIS to discredit the Iraqi military.

[The patches worn by the men in one of the photos posted to Instagram appear to match the patches of the Iraqi Emergency Response Brigade (E.R.B.), a counter-terrorism unit within the Ministry of Interior.]

""It does not look like ISIS propaganda at all,"" Gavrilis said. ""I don’t know how we could support them, if they are spearheading a lot on the front lines alongside these militias, and if they are conducting these kinds of atrocities as well... These Shi’a militias are just as barbaric as ISIS.""

Some militias take pride in their atrocities and appear to often be calling the shots on the battlefield, not the government forces, BloombergView columnist Eli Lake found when he recently visited the front lines north of Baghdad.

Officials said that the State Department's human rights observers and military intelligence had viewed examples of Iraqi Security Forces posting atrocities on personal social media for over a year. But one knowledgeable U.S. official said that since ABC News began asking about the many disturbing images last fall, the atrocities allegations against Iraq’s fighting forces have grown “more severe” and the “very concerning” allegations are being raised at high levels in Baghdad.

The Pentagon spokesperson told ABC News the U.S. military has ""discussed with Iraqi leaders the paramount importance of maintaining high standards of conduct and protecting civilian populations of all sects.""

""The actions of a small minority, if left unchecked, could do serious harm to the efforts of the Iraqi government,"" the spokesperson said.

With several thousand American troops back in Iraq as trainers, the alleged atrocities by Iraqi troops puts U.S. military commanders in the unenviable position of having to sort out which units are clean or dirty, Gavrilis said.

[The severed head of an alleged ISIS fighter is being held up by a desert camouflage-uniformed individual in front of a Humvee in this image uploaded to Instagram. Patches on his uniform match those often worn by the Iraqi Army.]

The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights last month released a report on Iraq that both condemned ISIS for its campaign of killings verging on genocide, but also criticized Iraqi Security Forces for military operations that ""which may have amounted to war crimes.""

Last March, the State Department's Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor also issued its own damning report on Iraq, stating that government officials under then-Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki committed ""extrajudicial killings"" -- meaning battlefield executions of ISIS suspects and killing individuals in custody without trial.

""Ministry of Interior officials tortured detainees to death, according to reports from multiple government officials and human rights organizations,"" read the annual report. The Bureau explicitly fingered the Iraqi Counter-Terrorism Forces and Interior Ministry's special police units -- which the U.S. established, trained and armed from 2003-2011, and whose troops are seen in many of the atrocities images.

But the State report was issued before the U.S. began airstrikes in Iraq last August to assist security forces in successfully retaking the Mosul Dam, and long before President Obama deployed thousands of American infantrymen, special operations forces and enablers back into Iraq beginning last fall to assist the Iraqis in fighting ISIS. A new report is expected soon, officials said.

Now that the alleged war crimes of the U.S.-backed forces have become public, the Iraqi spokesman stressed that his government will not tolerate “bad behavior.”

Using the Arabic slang for ISIS, Gen. Maan said, ""We do not allow any person to be a savage like Daesh.""

Michelle Parker was last seen on Nov. 17, 2011, the same day the prerecorded episode featuring herself and her former fiance, Dale Smith, aired nationally as they attempted to resolve a dispute over a $5,000 engagement ring.

Investigators have considered Smith, the father of Parker's twins, the lone person of interest in her disappearance, although he has never been charged.

Orlando police on Friday revisited a wooded area near Smith's home where Parker was last seen dropping off their toddlers, and the body of water where her cell phone was found two weeks later. According to authorities, about 30 officers searched for roughly three hours and Parker's family was present during the search.

Although the search teams combed through the wooded area, they came up empty.

""It's agony not knowing what happened to your child,"" Parker's mother, Yvonne Stewart, told ABC News. ""They thought they should go back and take a look at these woods.""

Parker's mother said authorities told her that search teams were looking for a decal that was missing from Parker's Humvee when it was found days later in a parking lot across town.

""I don't want to find her dead. I want to find her alive."" said Parker's father Brad.

Smith's attorney told reporters that his client committed no crime. He has custody of their children.

""We are going to find Michelle,"" said Brad Parker. ""It's just a matter of time."""

The gunman remains on the loose.

Freelance journalist Bradley Rayford was nearby when the shooting occurred.

“As we were about to pack our cameras up, we hear what we thought were fireworks up the street,” Rayford told ABC News. “Turns out, happened three more times. It was gunfire because we saw the muzzle fire from the gun up top of the street.

“It was kind of traumatic. ... I'm still kind of in shock because of it.”

The shooting and its aftermath were captured on social media and streaming video, tense moments experienced in real-time.

St. Louis County Police Chief John Belmar, speaking to media members this morning, said the shots came from an undetermined location north or northwest of the Ferguson Police Department building. The protests followed the resignation of the city’s police chief, Tom Jackson.

“I don't know who did the shooting, to be honest with you,"" Belmar said, adding he could not provide a description of the suspect or gun.

Belmar said his assumption was that, based on where the officers were standing and the trajectory of the bullets, the officers were targeted.

“These were shots that were parallel to the ground, not up in the air, and not at. They weren't skip shots and we have to make an assumption that these shots were directed exactly at my police officers,” Belmar said."

The well-preserved fossilized remains of one of the beastly creatures was found in Morocco and studied by scientists from Oxford and Yale Universities who published their findings in the journal ""Nature.""

Stretching nearly two meters long, the giant lobster-like species, named Aegirocassis benmoulae used its spine-covered limbs to scrape food from the ocean floor.

""These animals are filling an ecological role that hadn't previously been filled by any other animal,"" Allison Daley a co-author of the study and a professor at Oxford University’s Department of Zoology, said in a statement.

""While filter feeding (filtering water to find food) is probably one of the oldest ways for animals to find food, previous filter feeders were smaller, and usually attached to the sea-floor,"" she said. ""We have found the oldest example of gigantism in a freely swimming filter feeder.""

The species also has pairs of swimming flaps on both sides of its body, something scientist said was likely a precursor to the double-branched legs seen today on related arthropods, such as spiders.

The lobster-like animal was a member of a now-extinct family of marine arthropods called anomalocaridids, which first appeared 520 million years ago during the Cambrian era."

Neil Patrick Harris had big shoes to fill, following last year's host Ellen DeGeneres. But from the show's opening to its close, he amazed and kept everyone laughing the entire time. Plus, his predictions were pretty magical.

Here are the Top 5 Moments from the Oscars:

1 - Harris and his Opening Number

Neil Patrick Harris wowed with an opening number for the ages, having Anna Kendrick and Jack Black join him onstage for ""Moving Pictures,"" a montage to past movies like ""Back to the Future"" and ""Singin',"" written by Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez, the duo behind “Frozen’s” “Let It Go.”

Harris opened mimicking iconic dances from these movies, then Kendrick came onstage wearing a gold, Cinderella-inspired gown. The two performed a duet for a few seconds before Black screams, ""Enough!"" the Tenacious D rocker then joined the duo on stage. It was incredible.

Plus, later on in the show, Harris made us laugh yet again as he did a parody of ""Birdman,"" coming on stage in his tighty whities, a.k.a. just his white underwear.

2 - The Passionate Speeches

From J.K. Simmons to Patricia Arquette, the speeches were all moving.

Simmons won the first award of the night for Best Supporting Actor, thanking his beautiful wife Michelle Schumacher.

""I am grateful every day for the most remarkable person I know, my wife,"" Simmons said. ""I am grateful for you love, your kindness, your wisdom, your sacrifice, your patience.""

Then he told his two children and all sons and daughters around the world, ""Call your mom, call you dad. If you are lucky enough to have a mother or father on this planet don't text, call them.""

""If you're lucky enough to have a parent on this Earth, call them."" -J.K. Simmons #Oscars pic.twitter.com/TLAmp6FV3e

Patricia Arquette spoke about women's rights and equality.

""We have fought for everybody else's equal rights. It's our time to have wage equality once and for all and women's right for everyone in America,"" she said, as Meryl Streep and everyone in the audience stood up and applauded.

""It’s our time to have wage equality — once and for all."" -Patricia Arquette #Oscars pic.twitter.com/y5umVEiJcs

Dana Perry spoke about suicide in her speech following her win for Documentary Short Subject.

""I lost my son. He was 15 when he killed himself and since that happened, what I said I think I said something like, we need to talk about suicide out loud to try to work against the stigma and silence around suicide because the best prevention for suicide is awareness and discussion and not trying sweep it under the rug,"" she said.

Finally, when Graham Moore won for his work on the screenplay for the ""The Imitation Game,"" he gave the world an insight into his inspiration and motivation for the film.

""When I was 16 years old, I tried to kill myself. I felt weird and different and felt like I didn't belong. Now I'm standing here this is for any kid out there who doesn't feel like they belong, because you do,"" he said. “Stay weird, stay different.”

3 - The ""Glory"" Performance That Had Everyone in Tears

Common and John Legend took the stage and performed ""Glory"" from ""Selma,"" which many in the audience in tears, including Chris Pine and David Oyelowo, the film's star. The song then won for Best Original Song.

Common said, ""Recently John and I got to go to Selma and perform on the bridge that Dr. King marched on 50 years ago. ... It was once a landmark of a divided nation, now a symbol for change. ... The spirit of this bridge was built on hope.""

4 - John Travolta Continues His Awkward Oscars

One year after flubbing Idina Menzel's name, Travolta took the stage again with the ""Frozen"" star and got it right. But he also grabbed and touched her face a little too much, which forced Neil Patrick Harris to comment at the end of the show.

""Travolta will be back next year apologizing to Menzel again for all the face touching,"" Harris said.

There was also this unique moment on the carpet where he posed for an awkward photo with ""Avengers"" star Scarlett Johansson, he snuck up behind her and kissed her on the cheek.

5 - ""Sound of Music"" Tribute

Lady Gaga stunned yet again as she sang songs from ""The Sound of Music.""

But just a couple dozen miles away in a northern Virginia mosque, one Muslim leader is already fighting that battle.

“I'm not going to be able to save every kid, but I have a responsibility to save kids here as much as I can in this mosque,” Imam Mohamed Magid of the All Dulles Area Muslim Society, or ADAMS, said. “We teach them here in this mosque, being a Muslim it means to believe in all aspects of life of being a good citizen and being a good individual.”

Magid has made efforts to integrate young Muslims into their community at a time where ISIS militants continue to ramp up their recruiting efforts online, he told ABC News chief global affairs correspondent Martha Raddatz in an interview.

“ISIS is very savvy in the Internet,” Magid said. “They see the traffic, who's coming to watch and so forth and during that time that’s where they catch the young person when he shows curiosity.”

U.S. officials estimate more than 20,000 foreign fighters have flocked to Iraq and Syria to fight in radical groups, with more than 150 Americans among them.

“They start offering [recruits] their narrative that ‘the Muslim world is being humiliated and look at all the suffering. Come and we'll give you a sense of purpose, come join us, we'll make you a great hero,’” Magid said. “The nature of a cult is justification.”

While most of his work has centered around preventative measures with youth, from civic engagement at the center to sports clubs, Magid said he recently changed one young man’s mind who had already been contacted by ISIS.

Magid said he is now confident the young man will never join the group.

“He came to realize this is not what the prophet teaches, and now he resents them, he wants them to be defeated,” Magid said. “Now that kind of young person could be the person to deradicalize and change the mind of other young people.”

The biggest obstacle for young Muslims, Magid said, is isolation.

“They isolate the person from his family: ‘Your parents are not good Muslims, don’t listen to them, your local Imam is not a good man,’ and then they become a cult where they are completely isolated from any opportunities, any possibilities to counter the narrative,” Magid said.

It’s one reason he started a workshop for parents centered around promoting Internet safety.

“We need the parents to be savvy and understanding their place in the virtual space,” Magid said. “The best line of defense in this whole issue is parents, family. Complete awareness about your children, for instance, what they're doing, who they are, friends they have in the virtual community, that’s very important.”

Abdullah Baig, who is an 18-year-old member of ADAMS, said young people in the Sterling, Virginia, mosque talk about compassion, loving one another and being kind to one’s parents as being central tenants of Islam."
18ghHUI,2015-02-24 00:00:00,North Carolina Powerball Winner Claims Third of $564 Million Prize - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Business/north-carolina-powerball-winner-claims-564-million-prize/story?id=29164478,"A North Carolina woman was presented today with one of three winning tickets for one of the biggest Powerball lottery drawings.

Marie Holmes, 26, a single mother of four children ages 9 months to 7-years old, is the state's biggest Powerball winner.

The $564.1 million jackpot, which has a cash value of $381 million, is the fifth largest lottery prize in U.S. history. The jackpot had increased over two months without a winner, starting at $40 million.

""This is going to make a huge difference for them,"" Holmes said of her children. ""They are going to be able to go to school and not worry about paying for it. They are going to live a comfortable life without struggling.""

Holmes, who said she is a ""full-time mother,"" said she's planning to continue her education in the nursing field while caring for her children. From Shallotte, North Carolina, she previously supported her children while working at Walmart, Food Lion, KFC, McDonald's and Subway restaurants.

""It was seven of us living in one home,"" she told reporters at a news conference. ""It wasn't comfortable but we made do. Everybody in that household will have their own place, because I don't plan on staying there.""

The occasional lottery player said the farthest she has traveled in the U.S. is Seattle and New York, but she's never left the country. She also said she is speaking with a financial adviser about the money, but she hopes to travel and give some money to a church, which she declined to name. She also hopes to give to an organization dedicated to cerebral palsy, because one of her children has the neurological disorder that affects muscle movement.

The Brunswick County resident presented one of the three winning tickets for the $564.1 million jackpot, the third-largest Powerball jackpot ever.

The largest Powerball jackpot was recorded on May 18, 2013, ultimately awarded to Gloria Mackenzie of Zephyrills, Florida.

North Carolina's largest jackpot winner matched all five white balls in the Feb. 11 Powerball drawing, giving her one-third of the prize.

The annuity payment provides $188 million, but she is choosing the $127 million lump sum.

Powerball is played in 44 states, Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

The three tickets matched the numbers 25, 11, 54, 13 and 39, with a Powerball of 19. The odds of winning were about 175 million to one."

""Secretary McDonald has apologized for the misstatement and noted that he never intended to misrepresent his military service,"" a White House official told ABC News. ""We take him at his word and expect that this will not impact the important work he's doing to promote the health and well-being of our nation's veterans.""

The exchange with the homeless man was part of a report about an effort to find military veterans among the homeless that aired on CBS News on Jan. 30.

""While I was in Los Angeles, engaging a homeless individual to determine his Veteran status, I asked the man where he had served in the military,"" McDonald said in a statement today. ""He responded that he had served in special forces. I incorrectly stated that I had been in special forces. That was inaccurate and I apologize to anyone that was offended by my misstatement.

""I have great respect for those who have served our nation in special forces,"" McDonald added. ""They, and all Veterans, deserve a Department of Veterans Affairs that provides them the care and benefits they have earned. I remain committed to continuing our progress to improve VA services and our ongoing effort to reform VA for the long-term.""

McDonald, former Procter and Gamble CEO, served with the Army's 82nd Airborne Division and completed jungle, arctic and desert warfare training, according to the Department of Veterans Affairs.

He earned the Ranger tab, the Expert Infantryman Badge and Senior Parachutist wings, the VA added, noting that McDonald, who retired as a captain, was awarded the Meritorious Service Medal after leaving the service."
18gkz3U,2015-02-23 00:00:00,Aaron Hernandez Trial: What Witnesses Heard Around Time of Slaying - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/US/aaron-hernandez-trial-witnesses-heard-loud-bangs-time/story?id=29164568,"Two people who were near an industrial plant on the night former NFL star Aaron Hernandez is accused of killing an acquaintance testified today they heard a series of loud bangs that prosecutors argue were gunshots.

One woman told the Massachusetts court she was sleeping in her car on the night that Odin Lloyd is believed to have died and she heard noises around 3:30 a.m. June 17, 2013.

""I heard a loud bang, maybe four or five times. Two slow ones, three fast ones,"" Barbara Chan said this morning.

Michael Ribeiro, who worked the night shift at a nearby factory in North Attleborough, Massachusetts, and who regularly took a break to listen to a radio show in his car around 3:00 a.m., said he heard something similar.

Neither witness said they saw the alleged shooting, but Ribeiro said he heard ""loud banging sound[s] like fireworks, about six or eight times.""

Hernandez is on trial in the killing of Lloyd, a semi-professional football player who was dating the sister of Hernandez's then-fiancee at the time of his death. There have been questions where the slaying occurred, although the victim's body was found at the industrial plant.

One controversial portion of testimony that was discussed in court today but not officially entered into evidence was a series of texts that Lloyd apparently sent to his sister around the time of his death. The judge ruled Friday that the texts should not be included because they would prompt the jury to speculate about their content.

The judge has since reversed that decision, however, and today said she would allow the number of texts, the times the texts were sent and the location from where they were sent to be allowed in court. That information has not yet been presented.

Today marks the 13th day of the former NFL star's trial. Though they were a regular presence early on, none of Hernandez's relatives were in court again today, making it the fourth day in a row.

State law enforcement and investigation figures were called to the stand following Chan and Ribeiro, including a state police officer who found a gun near the reported crime scene.

The gun shown in court today had two bullets when it was found, but it is not believed to be the alleged murder weapon. Police have never found the weapon that was used to allegedly kill Lloyd.

Sgt. William Tarbokas of the Massachusetts State Police then told how he took Lloyd's fingerprints while he was being held at the medical examiner's office. Prosecutors argue that the fingerprints prove that he was present inside Hernandez's rented car before his death.

Two women who cleaned Hernandez's house also testified this afternoon, recalling an incident when they found a gun at his house -- which was not the same model that was used to kill Lloyd.

Both cleaners also told how they smelled marijuana in different parts of the home.

They also testified that Hernandez's then-fiancee Shayanna Jenkins told them to sign a non-disclosure agreement.

Hernandez has been charged with murder and weapons-related charges. He has pleaded not guilty."
18goY6Z,2015-02-23 00:00:00,"Mall Threat 'Not Likely' to Inspire Attacks Soon, Feds Say, But Malls Prepare for Worst - ABC News",http://abcnews.go.com/US/mall-threat-inspire-attacks-feds-malls-prepare-worst/story?id=29168062,"With groups like ISIS flooding the Internet with its propaganda, a weekend call for attacks on U.S. shopping centers by a lesser-known terrorist group in Somalia is ""not likely"" to inspire violence anytime soon, according to federal authorities.

In a 76-minute propaganda video posted online Saturday, the al Qaeda-linked group al-Shabab urged Western followers to strike in their home countries with attacks like the one targeting a popular mall in Kenya two years ago, when a four-day siege tied to al-Shabab left 67 dead.

""Our top priority at Mall of America is the safety of all guests. These test drills help us to prepare for emergency situations,"" signs posted in the mall reportedly read.

U.S. officials expressed skepticism that al-Shabab's video will produce an emergency situation.

""Our view is it's propaganda,"" State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said of the video. ""There's not a credible threat against malls.""

Similarly, the FBI and Department of Homeland Security said Sunday that so-called ""homegrown violent extremists"" are ""not likely to respond immediately"" to the weekend call for attacks because such homegrown radicals are paying ""greater attention ... to supporting fighters in other foreign conflict zones, such as Syria,"" where ISIS is wreaking havoc and using online social media to radicalize tens of thousands around the world.

In addition, al-Shabab's past messaging has had ""limited resonance,"" the FBI and DHS said in an intelligence bulletin issued to law enforcement on Sunday.

""Previous al-Shabab videos have called for Western Muslims to conduct attacks around the world without result,"" and neither the 2013 attack on the Westgate mall in Nairobi, Kenya, nor al-Shabab's subsequent praise of it have ""mobilize[d] operatives,"" the bulletin added.

Still, the top law enforcement agencies urge security officials and shoppers at malls across the United States to remain vigilant, saying the ""individualized nature of the radicalization process makes it difficult"" to predict or detect plotting by homegrown radicals.

During a morning drill at the Mall of America on Monday, a recording saying ""Attention Guests: This a drill"" echoed throughout the mall as shopkeepers temporarily brought gates down.

""We're concerned because, yes, it could happen,"" one shopper at the mall Monday told NNS. ""It's a big target for someone that wants to cause a lot of havoc.""

Still, the shopper said that is ""not going to probably keeps us away.""

Al-Shabab has proven to be a potent and lethal force in East Africa. Three years before the attack on Westgate mall in Kenya, the group claimed responsibility for a series of coordinated bombings in Uganda targeting soccer fans watching the 2010 World Cup. More than 70 people were killed, and another 70 were injured.

For several years, al-Shabab has been waging war against the fledgling government in Somalia, which has been backed by the U.S. government and the government in neighboring Ethiopia.

After Ethiopian forces moved into Somalia in 2007, al-Shabab was able to recruit dozens of Americans to the fight, as estimated by the U.S. Justice Department. But many of those Americans have said they went to Somalia to push the Ethiopians ""invaders"" out, not to harm the United States in any way.

Meanwhile, reports out of Somalia have indicated deep fractures within al-Shabab over whether the group should become more of a global enterprise and try to launch attacks outside East Africa, perhaps in the West.

""We assess al-Shabab is [still] focused primarily on efforts to topple the Somali Federal Government and expel foreign troops from Somalia,” the FBI and DHS said in the bulletin on Sunday.

In addition, DHS issued a separate statement to media on Sunday, saying: ""As a general matter, we are not aware of any specific, credible plot against the Mall of America or any other domestic commercial shopping center.""

Her attorneys did not want it to be made public, but a court overruled the wishes.

Arias wanted to testify behind closed doors because she said she was getting death threats and wouldn't be able to answer question in a manner ""she truly means,"" according to the testimony.

""Because what I did was so horrific I couldn't have -- I could never have imagined myself doing that to another human being,"" Arias said.

But it didn't take long for the defense to switch course and focus on Arias' upbringing, including her relationship with her mother and also with her on-again-off-again boyfriend, Travis Alexander.

""Well my mom began to carry a wooden spoon in her purse and wherever we were, whether it was home or out somewhere, if we were misbehaving, she would pull it out and whack us with it,"" Arias said.

""Yeah, he squeezed really hard and then he let go and I fell to my knees, very lightheaded, I almost passed out, but I didn't,"" Arias said of her boyfriend.

On the second day of her secret testimony, Arias told jurors she and Alexander met at a convention in Las Vegas, and shortly after, their relationship grew physical.

Arias said Alexander introduced her to his Mormon faith. But she said she was uncomfortable with how fast they were moving, especially after an encounter in her car.

Soon after that, Judge Sherry Stephens received an order from the Arizona Court of Appeals, putting a stop to the secret testimony. Arias opted not to address the jurors again.

Arias faced a possible death sentence for the 2008 murder of Alexander, but after the first jury could not decide how to sentence her, a second jury was assembled for a second crack at the sentencing phase. That second sentencing trial resulted in a hung jury after one holdout would not agree to sentence her to death.

Now, the judge is tasked with deciding whether Arias will be sentenced to life in prison with or without the possibility of parole in 25 years."

After shopping at a Tesco grocery story, Maria Layton said she found a web with eggs from a Brazilian wandering spider hiding out in the bananas, according to The Telegraph.

The critter is listed by the Guinness Book of World Records as the world's most venomous spider, with a neurotoxin so deadly it takes just 0.00000021 ounces to kill a mouse. The spider's venom made headlines in 2007, when scientists started to research if the venom could treat impotence, according to the BBC.

Layton told the Telegraph her daughter had asked for a banana and when she pulled it out, she found the large web.

""I was so scared -- I don't like spiders at the best of times, but have read about the Brazilian wandering spiders and was very frightened about the potential threat,"" she told The Telegraph.

Layton said she put the arachnid-infested banana in a sealed container in the freezer to kill the eggs.

A spokeswoman for the grocery store, Tesco, where Layton bought the bananas, said they've apologized to the shocked mother of two.

""We’ve apologised to Mrs. Layton and offered a gesture of goodwill. We’ve asked her to return the product to our store so we can conduct a full investigation,"" the company said in a statement.

Richard Pollack, a former public health entomologist at the Harvard School of Public Health and president of IdentifyUs, a Boston company that helps identifies insects and offers guidance on infestations for customers, said that he has started to see reports of similar instances as the use of pesticides has lessened across the globe and as technologies have allowed produce to go from farm to table faster than ever before.

""Imagine the surprise of the spider of being in the field on Tuesday and being in someone’s kitchen on Friday,"" Pollack said.

While he said she realized the shock of seeing a venomous spider can be scary for a consumer, he said it's extremely rare for a spider found in the grocery aisle to be a deadly hazard.

""The risk is incredibly tiny,"" said Pollack. ""It’s not likely [you're] going to get bitten. ... The best thing to do is probably dispatch the spider."""
18HqbDR,2015-03-13 00:00:00,The Mysterious Disappearance of Facebook Fraud Suspect Paul Ceglia and His Family - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/mysterious-disappearance-facebook-fraud-suspect-paul-ceglia-family/story?id=29612860,"A New York man set to stand trial for an alleged multi-billion dollar scheme to defraud Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has eluded authorities for nearly a week after slicing off his electronic monitoring bracelet and fleeing his home, authorities said.

Paul Ceglia, who was under house arrest awaiting his May 4 trial, is believed to be traveling with his wife, two sons and family dog, according to a bulletin from the U.S. Marshal's Office.

""Everyone has been focused on him, but our greatest concern is where are his wife and children,"" Ceglia's attorney, Robert Ross Fogg, told ABC News today. ""I don't know if the marshals have dusted for prints or have ruled out foul play.""

Fogg said it was not yet clear whether a third party may have been involved or if Ceglia cut off his own bracelet and took his wife and children with him.

Ceglia claimed in a federal lawsuit that he gave Zuckerberg $1,000 in start-up money when the Facebook CEO was a student at Harvard University in exchange for a 50 percent share of the future company. That lawsuit was dismissed after a court deemed that Ceglia created fraudulent email evidence.

Prosecutors filed mail fraud and wire fraud charges that carry up to 40 years in prison. Ceglia has pleaded not guilty.

Authorities are unable to pinpoint the moment Ceglia went missing last weekend. After slicing off his electronic monitoring bracelet, authorities said Ceglia attached it to a motor-driven device to make it appear as though he was still wearing it and moving around his home in Wellsville, New York.

When authorities visited Ceglia's home on Sunday, no one answered, according to documents filed in the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan. However, they said they were able to hear a mechanical noise inside the home. They came back Sunday night with a search warrant and entered the home, where they found Ceglia's bracelet hanging from a contraption on the ceiling, according to the documents.

The bracelet's charger was also connected to a timer, allowing authorities to still receive the same reports they would get when Ceglia periodically charged his device, according to the documents.

""The facts may suggest a high likelihood he may have [removed his bracelet on his own] but the actual fact that he did something is not there,"" Fogg said, suggesting there is no definitely proof that his client was the one who cut the bracelet.

Fogg said he has tried emailing Ceglia but has not received a reply.

A missing persons report was filed Wednesday for Ceglia's wife, Iasia Ceglia, and his two sons, Joseffinn, 11, and Leenan, 10, according to the Associated Press.

Iasia Ceglia's sister, Brianna Caster, told ABC News she wasn't surprised Ceglia ""would attempt something like this"" but said it was unlike her sister to simply leave without telling anyone.

""We don’t believe she would participate in this willingly,"" Caster said. ""Just from what we know in the past, we wouldn't put it past him to say the kids are coming with me with or without you. She puts everyone before herself and would want to make sure her kids are safe.""

18hVTYP,2015-02-24 00:00:00,Trayvon Martin: DOJ Announces No Charges Against George Zimmerman - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/US/trayvon-martin-doj-announces-charges-george-zimmerman/story?id=29186648,"While the public waits for a Justice Department announcement over two separate investigations spurred by the summer shooting of an unarmed teenager in Ferguson, Missouri, the department announced today it is closing its investigation into the killing of Trayvon Martin.

Justice Department officials met with Martin's family today, and were told that they will not be filing charges against George Zimmerman, who shot the 17-year-old after a confrontation in 2012. Thursday marks three years to the day since Martin was killed.

Federal prosecutors concluded there is not sufficient evidence to prove Zimmerman, a neighborhood watchman in Sanford, Fla., intentionally violated Martin's civil rights.

""Although the department has determined that this matter cannot be prosecuted federally, it is important to remember that this incident resulted in the tragic loss of a teenager's life,"" Acting Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta of the Civil Rights Division said. ""Our decision not to pursue federal charges does not condone the shooting that resulted in the death of Trayvon Martin and is based solely on the high legal standard applicable to these cases.""
The case sparked intense discussions over race in America because Martin was walking to his home with only Skittles and an iced tea in his hands.

Florida prosecutors tried to convict Zimmerman of state-level murder and manslaughter charges, but in July 2013 a jury acquitted him, saying prosecutors didn't have enough evidence to prove their case.

One juror -– the only minority on the all-female jury –- later told ABC News that ""as the law was read to me, if you have no proof that he killed him intentionally, you can't say he's guilty.""

""You can't put the man in jail even though in our hearts we felt he was guilty,"" she said. ""But we had to grab our hearts and put it aside and look at the evidence.""

In Sanford, race-related tensions had been simmering for nearly a century, but Martin's death ""was the proverbial 'straw that broke the camel's back,'"" bringing ""those issues to the surface,"" the new Sanford police chief, Cecil Smith, recently told federal officials.

After Martin was killed, Holder sat down his own teenage son to explain that -- as unfair as it may be -- young black men must often interact with police in a different way than others, he told a convention in April 2014. It was ""a conversation I hoped I'd never have to have,"" Holder added.

As media attention mounted over Martin's death, protests grew across the country calling for justice. The city of Sanford now says a police department had not been scrutinized like that by the press, religious organizations, social activists and the broader public since Los Angeles police beat Rodney King in 1991.

Zimmerman was not a police officer and the neighborhood watch program he was a part of was independent from local police.

Many accused Zimmerman of discriminating against Martin –- essentially taking action against the teenager and ultimately killing him because Martin was black. Zimmerman is Hispanic.

The Justice Department's Civil Rights Division and FBI opened an investigation into the case, noting ""experienced federal prosecutors"" would determine ""whether the evidence reveals a prosecutable violation"" of federal law. In a statement, the department noted there are ""limited federal criminal civil rights statutes within our jurisdiction.""

Privately and publicly, Justice Department officials have been telegraphing all along that they were unlikely to file charges against Zimmerman. And in November 2013, Holder said the case against Zimmerman ""in substantial part was resolved"" with his acquittal months earlier.

Nevertheless, federal officials have insisted their civil-rights probe would be thorough and complete. Several months ago –- nearly two years into the Justice Department's investigation –- Holder said federal investigators were still seeking to interview certain witnesses ""as a result of some recent developments.""

More recently, Holder has said he hoped to announce the findings of the Zimmerman and Ferguson-related probes before he leaves office, which could happen in a matter of weeks, depending on when the U.S. Senate confirms his successor.

Holder has said then when a decision is announced in the Zimmerman case, it will be accompanied by ""as much information"" as possible detailing the Justice Department's findings.

In the Ferguson case, the department is currently conducting two probes into the matter.

A criminal investigation will try to determine whether then-officer Darren Wilson used unreasonable force and intentionally violated Michael Brown's civil rights when he shot the unarmed teenager in August. The second probe - though not criminal in nature –- will look more broadly into whether the Ferguson police department has routinely engaged in a ""pattern or practice"" of unlawful and discriminatory policing.

A state grand jury in Ferguson, Missouri, declined to indict Wilson in Novembe4 2014. Many expect the Justice Department will not be able to bring federal charges against Wilson, but will take action against the local police department.

The experts at Madden not only predicted the exact final score of the game but also a handful of other details that kept their days-old predictions eerily close to the actual results from Sunday night.

Some were not entirely surprising, like the prediction that Seattle Seahawks star Marshawn Lynch would score a touchdown (which he did).

Same for the Patriots' tight end Rob Gronkowski (he also who scored a touchdown).

Madden predicted that the score would be close going into halftime - 17 to 14. The game was actually tied at the half at 14.

They predicted that punt returner and wide receiver Julian Edelman would score one of the Patriot's critical touchdowns. Prior to this season, Edelman had only scored ten other touchdowns since he was first drafted in 2009.

The pick that Tom Brady would earn his third MVP honor was also on target.

Madden guessed that Brady would throw 335 yards, leading to four touchdowns; he was actually just shy of that, with 328 yards and four touchdowns.

This is the ninth time in the past 12 years that the game has accurately predicted the winner of the Super Bowl, but this is by far the most detailed read of the virtual tea leaves."

18imF3n,2015-02-25 00:00:00,When the Fear of Icy Driving Conditions Is Too Debilitating to Leave Home - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Health/fear-icy-driving-conditions-debilitating-leave-home/story?id=29082285,"Driving in the winter can be treacherous. Snow, ice and whiteouts can cause pileups, skid-outs and stranded drivers.

Despite this year’s brutal wintery conditions, most of us still brave icy roads, but for Amy Andrews, just the thought of driving in winter causes overwhelming, white-knuckled, debilitating fear.

Andrews’s phobia over driving in snowy or icy conditions is so crippling, just a weather report about a chance of snow, or snow falling unexpectedly, will throw her into a full-blown panic attack.

“This is something that I can’t do,” she said. “If I absolutely have to drive in this bad weather then the whole time I am shaking and I don’t breathe properly and I get lightheaded.”

It’s estimated that about 9 percent of American adults suffer from specific phobias, irrational fears of things from flying, heights, elevators and spiders, according to the National Institute of Health.

“When somebody is exposed to the object they’re frightened of they feel intense anxiety,” said renowned psychotherapist Robi Ludwig. “Their heart can race, they can sweat, they can feel that they’re having a panic attack or a heart attack but it’s basically how somebody feels when they’re in the fight or flight reaction. They really feel like their bodies are in danger.”

More than 2,000 people are killed every year in winter weather-related accidents, and facing that possibility behind the wheel is just too much for Andrews.

She lives in New England, which has been battered by record-breaking snowfall this winter. Her phobia has made normal life nearly impossible. She is almost too scared to drive if there is one snowflake in the air, even forcing her to miss work at her job as a school administrator.

“I have had panic attacks where it just starts snowing, where I will end up in the bathroom hyper-ventilating, ready to pass out,” she said.

Andrews will check the weather obsessively, and cancel plans if there is a threat of snow.

“My sister moved to New Hampshire and I told her that I refused to go up there any time from November to March,” Andrews said.

But Andrews was determined to conquer her fear. She agreed to let “Nightline” send her to a complimentary class at one of the toughest, and most terrifying, winter driving school in the country: The Bridgestone Winter Driving School in Steamboat, Colorado.

There, students have to drive on a track made entirely of snow and ice – Andrews’s worst fear – as instructors teach the fundamentals of winter driving, from what to do if your car skids out to having weight balance in the vehicle.

But before she began, Andrews had a rough start. Her car got stuck on an icy road just trying to get from her hotel to the driving school, and she needed to have her car towed up the road. Right away, the first stages of panic set in.

“She was pretty wound up,” said head instructor Kurt Spitzner. “[But] I think we were going to have a positive effect on her.”

When Andrews finally got to class, and started working with an instructor, something did change.

“I think the results were remarkable,” Spitzner said. “Just seeing how she stopped hyper-ventilating a quarter of the way through the class made me feel really good. This is a start.”"
18Itw5W,2015-02-03 00:00:00,'American Sniper' Chris Kyle's Alleged Killer on Trial Next Week - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/US/texas-celebrates-chris-kyle-day-days-alleged-killers/story?id=28663876,"Today marks ""Chris Kyle Day"" in Texas as Gov. Greg Abbott made a proclamation in the Navy SEAL's honor this afternoon.

The announcement comes on the second anniversary of Kyle's death and on the week before the trial is scheduled to begin for his alleged killer, Eddie Ray Routh.

Details about the thorough jury selection process have been revealed just days ahead of the alleged killer's murder trial.

The two-step jury process selection begins on Thursday where the possible jurors will be asked questions about whether they have seen the movie ""American Sniper"" or read Kyle's autobiography of the same name.

Erath County District Court officials have allotted Thursday and Friday for the hundreds of jurors to fill out those questionnaires before returning on Monday and Tuesday for the second portion, which will consist of a standard voir dire questioning.

The judge told ABC News that 800 jurors have been summoned, and that large number is based off the expectation that only about half will show up.

If the selection process stays on this schedule, they will have 12 jurors and two alternates selected by next Tuesday afternoon, ready for opening statements Wednesday morning. The trial is expected to last for two weeks.

All parties involved in the case, including the selected jurors, will be placed under a gag order.

Kyle, the central character in the movie ""American Sniper,"" is widely recognized for having made the highest number of confirmed kills in American military history. He was fatally shot at a gun range in Texas in 2013, allegedly by Routh.

Since leaving the military in 2009, Kyle had spent time working with wounded veterans and, in some cases, he spent time with them on the shooting range.

""He was finding this real peace and joy being able to see his kids every day,"" his widow Taya Kyle told People Magazine in a recent interview.

That rehabilitation work is believed to have been the reason why he arranged for the trip to the gun range with his friend Chad Littlefield and Routh on Feb. 2, 2013.

Routh was arrested later that same day and charged with the murders of Kyle and Littlefield.

The trial was initially slated to begin last May but delays led to it be pushed back to start next week in Erath County, Texas.

The prosecution has said that they will not be seeking the death penalty.

One factor that will undoubtedly come up during the trial is Routh's mental health. His sister said during her frantic 911 call after he drove to her house from the gun range that he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder.

""My client will plead not guilty by reason of insanity,"" Routh's attorney, J. Warren St. John, told People Magazine last month.

St. John, who did not immediately respond to a request for comment from ABC News, has previously said he is concerned about getting an impartial jury, in part, due to the recent release of the film ""American Sniper,"" starring Bradley Cooper.

""The film will be an issue,"" St. John told People. ""I think any case with significant publicity has an issue with picking a jury. I've had them in the past, and anything that has significant national attention makes it hard to pick a jury.""

Routh's attorneys filed a motion in 2013 to change the location of the trial, but it was denied.

18jBGRZ,2015-03-13 00:00:00,'Slender Man' Stabbing: Judge Rules Enough Probable Cause for 1st Degree Attempted Homicide Charges - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/US/slender-man-stabbing-probable-1st-degree-attempted-homicide/story?id=29615523,"There is enough probable cause for the first-degree attempted homicide charges against two Wisconsin girls accused of stabbing their friend 19 times in an Internet-inspired fictional character named Slender Man, a judge ruled today.

Without a lesser charge, the cases cannot automatically be moved into juvenile court without reverse waiver hearings.

Reverse-waiver hearing dates have now been set, where the defense teams will argue whether the first-degree charge should remain in adult court or continue in juvenile court, said Judge Michael Bohren.

Morgan Geyser and Anissa Weier, both now 13, were arrested on May, 31, 2014, after allegedly stabbing their then-12-year-old friend Payton Leutner 19 times and leaving her to die in the woods in their hometown of Waukesha, Wisconsin. But after being rushed to the hospital with life threatening injuries, Payton survived.

Anissa's reverse-waiver hearing is set for May 26 and 27; Morgan's for June 17 and 18, the judge said.

Both Morgan and Anissa were obsessed with the fictional character Slender Man, who is often depicted in fan fiction stories online as a horror figure who stalks children. In court this past February, disturbing drawings depicting Slender Man and dismembered Barbie dolls recovered from Morgan’s bedroom were shown.

When asked to describe ""Slender Man,"" Morgan told the detective on the interrogation tape that he was ""a tall, faceless man who preys on children,"" according to the tapes.

""He watches you,"" she added. ""I've never seen him. He's everywhere.""

Authorities say Morgan repeatedly told detectives it was ""necessary"" to kill Payton to become ""proxies"" of Slender Man and live with him in his mansion in
the woods. They believed his mansion was in the Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest in northern Wisconsin. Morgan told police their plan to kill their friend began as early as December 2013.

Dozens of images taken from the rover's robotic arm were woven together to create the selfie, which shows off the Pahrump Hills site where Curiosity has been exploring and drilling to learn more about the Martian environment.

A version of the photo released by NASA points out the various spots where Curiosity has been conducting research over the past five months. The images used for the mosaic selfie were taken at the Mojave 2 drilling site.

""Compared with the earlier Curiosity selfies, we added extra frames for this one so we could see the rover in the context of the full Pahrump Hills campaign,"" Kathryn Stack, a member of the Curiosity team, said in a statement.

18leN11,2015-02-24 00:00:00,Partially Paralyzed Athlete Completes Marathons on All Seven Continents - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/US/partially-paralyzed-athlete-completes-marathons-continents/story?id=29196830,"A partially disabled woman is celebrating an amazing achievement after completing marathons on all seven continents.

Beth Sanden finished her most recent race less than a week ago in the frozen continent of Antarctica slogging through ice, mud and trails for nearly 11 hours.

""It’s icy and it’s not flat, it’s got mud, it’s got rocks, it's got gravel,"" Sanden told ABC News. ""It’s the worst terrain you could ever be in.""

While Sanden was the last one to complete the race, she said many of her able-bodied competitors stayed to watch her cross the line.

""They were complaining about this and that ... then they shut up,"" Sanden, 60, recalled of her competitors seeing her go slowly down the route.

""A lot of them stayed there in the end,"" she said, noting her competitors cheered her at the finish line.

Sanden was partially paralyzed in 2002 while she was training for a 50-mile bike race. A bike crash resulted in multiple fractured vertebrae, she said.

While doctors initially believed she would never walk again, Sanden, an avid athlete, said she was determined to recover. Within 20 months she managed to regain movement in her right leg and eventually she returned to the racing circuit via hand cycle, she said.

For the past four years, Sanden, a triathlon coach, has been on a mission to inspire other disable athletes by completing marathons on all seven continents.

""A lot of the people I coach are disabled [and] are younger than me,"" said Sanden. ""Sometimes they need motivation.""

Sanden came up with her mission after she was invited to complete the marathon on the Great Wall of China. Due to the steps, she had to travel much of the distance on her walker, with her incapacitated left leg in a sling, she said.

After five hours, Sanden said she realized she wasn't going to get to the finish line by the eight-hour cutoff. With the organizer's blessing, Sanden switched from walker to hand cycle and finished the race along a route near the wall.

""They had a couple guys get up and carry me down,"" Sanden said, noting she completed the marathon in 7 hours 20 minutes.

After that, the mother and coach traveled the world finishing races in Italy, Peru, Tasmania, Mt. Kilimanjaro in Africa and Boston, Massachusetts.

During this time she has tried to raise awareness for disable athletes and raise money for the nonprofit group Challenged Athletes Foundation, which aims to support disabled athletes.

During the long slog through Antarctica, Sanden said she was particularly happy to hear from the young athletes she coaches. She said she got multiple messages asking if she was alright.

""'Coach are you doing ok? I can’t believe you’re doing this,'"" Sanden recalled the messages reading. ""It’s worth it.""

She said she often counsels newly disabled people and hopes her story will give more people hope.

""[I do this] mainly to inspire those young disabled people I coach, to say here’s a person who is 60 years old and if I can do it, you can do it, too,"" said Sanden. ""A lot of them will come out of the hospital and say that’s not the end of my life."""

The Jan. 9 message obtained by ABC News was sent by Howard Attarian, senior vice president of flight operations, and Mike Quiello, vice president of corporate safety. The Wall Street Journal first reported about the message.

Two of the events occurred near the ground, according to the bulletin -- with a pull-up maneuver required in one of the incidents. Another incident involved an “undesired aircraft state on departure,” with the flight crew contributing to a safety lapse.

A fourth incident involved a low fuel state.

“The common thread with all of these is that they are preventable,” the message stated.

A 2013 UPS cargo plane crash in Birmingham, Alabama, which was later blamed on pilot error, was referenced in the message. The plane crashed short of the runway at Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport, killing two crew members.

Pilot retirements, seat movements and new hires were identified in the message as factors that bring added risk to flight operation.

“While no one ever shows up to work with the goal of intentionally making a mistake, we are human and mistakes happen. What we can control is how we conduct ourselves on each and every flight,” the message stated.

United issued a statement to ABC News Wednesday after details of the message were initially reported by the Wall Street Journal. ABC News reached out to the airline early Thursday with calls for further comment, but those efforts were unsuccessful.

“As part of our commitment to safety, we constantly monitor flight operations data and regularly communicate the findings with our pilots,” the statement read. “Our proactive approach to safety aligns with the FAA’s Safety Management System and enables us to recognize potential issues and adjust our actions to further ensure the safety of our customers and coworkers.”

Here is the full memo:

Date: January 9, 2015

SAFETY ALERT: Significant safety concerns

Recent events in our operation have dictated that we communicate with all of you immediately. Over the past few weeks, our airline has experienced what we would categorize as major safety events and near-misses.

In Flight Operations we have seen two events in close proximity to terrain (one resulting in a GPWS pull-up maneuver), an Undesired Aircraft State on departure and a low fuel state on arrival after a deviation from a Sabre Flight Plan routing.

The common thread with all of these is that they are preventable. We must ask ourselves, “Do we have our priorities in line every time we put on our uniforms and strap into the airplane?” While the airline industry always seems to be in a state of flux, the one constant for all of us is that we are professional aviators with the common goal of flying our passengers and crew from point A to point B SAFELY.

Another common thread to some of these events is a lack of attention to disciplined Crew Resource Management. Every time we enter the cockpit with the intention of performing our pilot duties, we evaluate risk. Every pilot must be willing to speak up if safety is in question. In the same vein, every pilot must also accept the input of their fellow crewmembers on the flight deck. In most cases, one of the pilots recognizes an unsafe situation. In some cases, a pilot’s input is ignored. This is unacceptable.

The recent CFIT accident in Birmingham involving another carrier underscores how quickly things can unravel. The approach and landing appeared normal to the pilots until right before impact. Let’s not for a moment think something like that could not happen at United.

We are currently seeing a lot of movement in the pilot group, such as retirements, seat movements and new hires, that -- while welcome -- introduces significant risk to the operation. While no one ever shows up to work with the goal of intentionally making a mistake, we are human and mistakes happen. What we can control is how we conduct ourselves on each and every flight. If you have ever used the term “Standard Brief” before departure, you have not complied with an SOP. If you have ever exceeded Stabilized Approach Criteria intentionally and not executed a go-around, you are not in compliance.

We know this is a brutally honest message and the tendency may be to rationalize why compliance is not occurring in some areas. Bottom line: United is at a critical juncture in its history and we as aviators must adhere to the policies and procedures outlined in the Flight Manuals, FOM, WOM and ALPA Code of Ethics. Reviewing, understanding, and complying with the guidance in company manuals is imperative to returning ourselves, our fellow crewmembers and passengers to their families safely. This is our top priority and greatest responsibility, and we appreciate in advance your continued commitment and cooperation.

Fly safe.

Zebb Quinn was 18 years old when he disappeared in 2000. Robert Jason Owens was considered a person of interest in that case but was never charged.

The 37-year-old contractor is being held without bond on three counts of first-degree murder in connection with the deaths of Cristie and Joseph “J.T.” Codd and their unborn child.

""It breaks my heart that these people had to die for some information to come to light,"" Quinn's mother, Denise Vlahakis, said in an exclusive interview with Good Morning America.

Cristie Schoen, as she was known in 2012 before she married, was a contestant on the Food Network’s cooking competition, “Food Network Star.” She and her husband disappeared last Sunday, and police in Asheville, North Carolina, said this week that Owens burned the bodies.

""He did admit to taking the bodies, storing them on his property, and destroying them,"" Buncombe County Sheriff Van Duncan said during a news conference Friday.

Asheville Police Sgt. Dave Romick said Owens was a person of interest in Quinn's disappearance. However, detectives never found the evidence they needed to bring charges.

""The fact that he has been arrested on three counts of murder, that is a huge event in the Zebb Quinn case,"" he said during a news conference Friday. “He was a person of interest almost immediately. Over the course of 15 years, he has become the primary person of interest.”

Quinn's mother hopes that Owens' arrest will lead police to her son.

""My hope for Zebb's case is that either Jason talks or that someone else who has information comes forward and that it's good enough information that we can ultimately hopefully find Zebb,"" she said.

A $25,000 reward is being offered for information that leads to Quinn's remains."

On March 4, a woman in Mariposa County, about 70 miles north of Fresno, reported several items stolen from her home, including a smart TV, a Wi-Fi Blu-ray, laptop computer, wires and a surround sound system, the Mariposa County Sheriff's Office said Friday.

A few days later, the woman discovered that movies were being watched on her Netflix account, which was linked to the stolen TV and Blu-ray, according to the sheriff's office.

Using Netflix and IP address information, authorities traced the internet usage to Bobby Alexander of Mariposa, officials said.

The stolen property was allegedly found in Alexander's home, police said. He was charged with burglary and held on $75,000 bail, officials said.

ABC News was unable to find an attorney for Alexander."

In a speech to New Delhi youth, Obama sought to leverage three days of back-slapping and bonhomie into a subtle challenge to the right-wing, Hindu nationalist government of his host. One Indian media outlet went so far to describe Obama’s words as a ""snub.""

""In our lives, Michelle and I have been strengthened by our Christian faith. Still, as you may know, my faith has at times been questioned — by people who don’t know me — or they’ve said that I adhere to a different religion, as if that were somehow a bad thing,"" he said. ""Every person has the right to practice their faith how they choose, or to practice no faith at all, and to do so free from persecution and fear.""

Obama called for celebration of racial diversity, invoking Michelle Obama’s ancestral ties to ""slaves and slave owners"" and occasions when he was ""treated differently because the color of my skin.""

He also upheld Mrs. Obama as a model women's rights, calling her a ""very strong and talented"" wife who ""frequently"" tells him he’s wrong.

""I'm surrounded by smart women,"" the president said. ""Every woman should be able to go about her day — to walk the street, or ride the bus — and be safe and be treated with the respect and dignity.""

The president, who was greeted by the crowd of 1,500 at Delhi's Siri Fort Auditorium with chants of ""Obama! Obama!,"" leaves India after three days on an upbeat note. He was the first American president to visit twice and the first to be honored as chief guest on Republic Day.

""I am the first American president to come to your country twice. But I predict I will not be the last. Because, as Americans, we believe in the promise of India,"" he said.

Obamas Meet Freed Child Slaves

Ahead of the speech, the Obamas met with three Indian youth who were rescued from child slavery and Kailash Satyarthi, the 2014 Nobel peace prize winner who shared the award with Malala Yousafzai.

Satyarthi is a leading anti-child slavery advocate. He was overheard telling Mr. Obama that there are still 5 million child slaves around the world. ""Thanks to your administration in America the number of child slaves has gone down,"" he said.

Mrs. Obama kept her arms around 12-year-old Payal Jangid the entire time.

From India to Saudi Arabia

President Obama now turns to a much different alliance, making a rare and impromptu visit to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on his way home.

The president will pay his respects to the Saudi royal family after Friday's death of Kind Abdullah, mark the transition to King Salman, and discuss the fight against ISIS and the situation in Yemen, White House officials said.

Obama brings with him more than two dozen top dignitaries, including Republican Sen. John McCain, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, and former George W. Bush Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice.

Obama is due back on U.S. soil on Wednesday."

A newly released video taken from the International Space Station shows stunning flashes of light as a lightning storm strikes Earth.

Taken from an altitude of 250 miles, the time-lapse footage was created using several dozen images captured in 2012 by an astronaut at the ISS. The video was released today on YouTube by the European Space Agency.

Since the space station moves at nearly 18,000 miles per hour in low-Earth orbit, it would be impossible to get a crisp image using a normal video camera.

The video was created using the agency's Nightpod camera, which accounts for the motion of the station and keeps the area being photographed in the center of the frame. The result: Breathtaking images, just like those seen here."

Anjelica ""AJ"" Hadsell has been missing since March 2, the Norfolk Police Department said.

Authorities developed a lead that led to today's search area, which Sam Shenouda of the Norfolk Police Department described as large, wooded and remote.

The investigation is ongoing, Shenouda said, so no other information about Hadsell's possible condition could be confirmed.

""We're not taking anything off the table,"" Shenouda said, adding that the police are ""trying to consider every possibility.""

Hadsell is described as standing at 5 feet 6 inches tall and weighing 120 pounds, according to police.

Hadsell, a Longwood University freshman who was home for spring break, was last seen around 7 a.m. on March 2 at her family's home in Norfolk.

Two days later, Norfolk police received a tip that Hadsell had been sighted on Virginia Commonwealth University's campus, two hours away from where she was last seen by family.

Investigators said there is no evidence of foul play, but her family and friends say she wouldn't disappear on purpose.

""This is not Anjelica,"" her friend Andre Barr told ABC News. ""We all know her, we know how she would act and this is not -- this is out of character.""

A job posting to man the ""Penguin Post Office"" in Port Lockroy, Antarctica, has received a record number of applicants: more than 1,500 since Feb. 16. In 2014, there were only 82 applicants all year long.

United Kingdom Antarctic Heritage Trust (UKAHT) is looking for four people to, in addition to taking care of the 70,000 cards posted each year for delivery to 100 countries, monitor the impact of the approximately 18,000 visitors to Port Lockroy, situated on Goudier Island in the Antarctic Peninsula, on the wildlife, plus record the number of visitors and ships visiting the area.

One reason for the increase in applications, the organization said, was the airing of the documentary ""Penguin Post Office"" on BBC2 in the U.K. in July 2014 and on PBS in the U.S. in January 2015.

Each year, the UKAHT’s U.K. team -- based in Cambridge -- searches for committed individuals to make up a small team of four to spend five months at its flagship site, Port Lockroy, situated on Goudier Island in the Antarctic Peninsula. The job runs from November 2015 to mid-March and pay is $1,700 per month.

Job Description:

""The team chosen to spend the 2015/16 season at Port Lockroy will assist the Base Leader in the efficient running of the post office, maintenance and museum operation, with areas of responsibility being divided up amongst team members. A can-do attitude is vital as is good physical fitness, co-ordination (carrying heavy boxes over slippery rocks and slushy snow whilst dodging the local gentoo penguin population is a frequent requirement), environmental awareness and a practical knowledge of minimum impact living. Above all successful candidates need to be passionate about the Antarctic.""

No post office experience is necessary and applicants need not be British citizens.

Amy Kincaid, a member of the current team, said applicants need to be ""realistic."" She called the living quarters (pictured) ""surprisingly cozy,"" though added that ""being confined to an island the size of a football pitch isn’t for everyone.""

Interested applicants can apply here. Deadline is midnight Friday."

Emwazi was was born in 1988, making him 26 or 27 years old, the BBC reported.

An activist group he communicated with before allegedly going to Syria said that Emwazi was born in Kuwait but moved to England when he was 6 years old.

The neighborhood is considered to be working class.

Neighbors told ABC News that Emwazi's relatives have not been seen at their home in the past week.

""If these allegations are true, we are shocked and sickened by the news,"" a spokesman for the university said in a statement.

Matt Olsen, former director of the National Counterterrorism Center and current ABC News consultant, said Emwazi's background points to a disturbing wrinkle.

""The identification of this individual, if it turns out that it is in fact confirmed, really just underscores the concern that ISIS has the ability to reach into London and recruit somebody who's well-educated and comes from a middle-class family,"" he said. ""That's a real concern for everyone in the counter-terrorism community.""

Greenwich Islamic Center no knowledge of any visit, or any link between Center & #JihadiJohn, Mohammed Emwazi #ISIS pic.twitter.com/LBAhvTNr83

CAGE describes itself as an ""advocacy organisation"" that regularly works on behalf of Guantanamo Bay detainees and Muslims who have been detained for terrorism. Their employee, Asim Qureshi, spoke today about how he communicated with Emwazi repeatedly between 2010 and 2012, when he is believed to have gone to Syria.

Qureshi described Emwazi as a ""beautiful young man"" when they met in the summer of 2009 to discuss Emwazi’s complaints about being detained and harassed by British authorities as he traveled.

He said he cannot confirm that the man in the ""Jihadi John"" video is Emwazi because his face is covered, but added that the personality is very different from the one he knew in London. He described Emwazi as kind, gentle and soft spoken.

He said Emwazi told him he didn't ""want to live in a country where I’m treated as the enemy.""

""What happened to him after then? I can’t tell you. I don’t know myself,"" Qureshi said.

He spoke English with a British accent in the video, hence his nickname, ""Jihadi John.""

Though he always appeared covered, his voice and stature led experts to believe that he was also the figure pictured in at least six other videos showing the deaths of Steven Sotloff, David Haines, Alan Henning, Peter Kassig, Kenji Goto Jogo and Haruna Yakuawa.

White House @NSCPress ""not able to confirm or deny"" reports on Jihadi John's identification - http://t.co/fmw05yCY0T pic.twitter.com/LW16iOVl0X

A spokesperson for Prime Minister David Cameron said that he ""would be concerned about information being put into the public domain at any time that might jeopardize ongoing police or security investigations or the safety of British citizens.""

“The Sotloff family was confident law enforcement would find him out and bring him to justice and they have full confidence the U.S. government will be able to do that,” the statement said. “The family would like to see him brought to a court in N.Y. or eastern Va. and watch him prosecuted for the beheading of their son and convicted to life in a super max facility. This is how justice is served in this country.”

""I think all the families will feel closure and relief once there’s a bullet between his eyes,"" she told ITV."

Located 12.8 billion light-years from Earth, astronomers discovered the behemoth black hole inside of a quasar that shines 420 trillion times brighter than the sun, according to an article published Wednesday in the journal ""Nature.""

The quasar is so bright, scientists say, because of the radiation emitted as matter is accelerated and sucked into the massive black hole.

The ancient quasar was believed to have been shining brightly when the universe was less than a billion years old. With the universe now dated at 13.8 billion years old, the quasar is shining much brighter and is extraordinarily bigger than what scientists would have expected for the ancient body.

There are 40 known quasars that date back to the first one billion years after the Big Bang, according to scientists, with each having a black hole with the mass of one billion suns. By comparison, the newly discovered quasar, called SDSS J0100+2802, is a giant among giants.

The sheer size of the black hole has posed a new question about how something so massive was able to form at the dawn of time.

""How can a quasar so luminous, and a black hole so massive, form so early in the history of the universe, at an era soon after the earliest stars and galaxies have just emerged?"" Xiaohui Fan, a professor astronomy at the University of Arizona and co-author of the study, said in a statement. ""And what is the relationship between this monster black hole and its surrounding environment, including its host galaxy?""

It's another mystery of the universe that astronomers will continue to ponder."

The video quickly gained visibility online. It was obtained and posted to Twitter by Unheard, which describes itself as ""an alliance of black students organized for change within campus administration and atmosphere."" The video shows young men on a bus chanting, ""There will never be a n----r at SAE.""

The tweet, directed at OU president David Boren, said ""Racism is alive at The University of Oklahoma.""

Students at the university planned to demonstrate on the Norman, Oklahoma, campus at 7:30 a.m. local time. A prayer vigil was held Sunday night.

The frat house was vandalized overnight, defaced with graffiti.

Chelsea Davis, one of two co-directors of Unheard, said the video was recorded during the weekend. Unheard was started at the beginning of the semester to demand change, especially relating to diversity issues, Davis said.

""Clearly in that video, that is nothing new. That is nothing that just sparks up overnight. That is a chant that was well-known, well-versed, and seemed to be OK with everybody that was involved,"" said Davis, a junior at the university.

Boren responded on Twitter, saying, ""If the video is indeed of OU students, this behavior will not be tolerated and is contrary to all of our values.""

If the video is indeed of OU students, this behavior will not be tolerated and is contrary to all of our values. We are investigating. - DBo

Brad Cohen, the national president of Sigma Alpha Epsilon, said the chapter ""has immediately been placed on a cease and desist.""

@Melyssious The chapter has immediately been placed on a cease & desist. No place for racism. They will be dealt with!

In a statement, the national SAE organization said it closed the Oklahoma Kappa chapter at the University of Oklahoma and suspended all of the fraternity's members -- and the members involved with the incident could have their membership privileges revoked permanently.

""We apologize for the unacceptable and racist behavior of the individuals in the video, and we are disgusted that any member would act in such a way. Furthermore, we are embarrassed by this video and offer our empathy not only to anyone outside the organization who is offended but also to our brothers who come from a wide range of backgrounds, cultures and ethnicities,"" Sigma Alpha Epsilon wrote in an online statement.

He was 83.

""He was a remarkable man, well known not only for his acting and directing, but also for his photography, contemporary art collection, and for his extremely generous philanthropic contributions and support of the arts,"" Gersh said via a statement to ABC. ""A private memorial service is being planned by the family. He will be missed by all.""

Nimoy, who played first officer to William Shatner's Captain Kirk on the Starship Enterprise in TV and movies, died Friday morning in Bel-Air, California, his granddaughter Madeleine Nimoy confirmed.

His son Adam told the Associated Press that he died of end-stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

The actor revealed he was struggling with the ailment in 2014, according to the New York Times. Nimoy had been a smoker, which contributed to the ailment, before he gave up the habit years ago.

“I quit smoking 30 yrs ago. Not soon enough. I have COPD ... Smokers, please understand. If you quit after you’re diagnosed with lung damage it’s too late. Grandpa says learn my lesson. Quit now. LLAP,” Nimoy tweeted in separate posts last year.

Earlier this week, Nimoy tweeted for the last time, writing, ""A life is like a garden. Perfect moments can be had, but not preserved, except in memory. LLAP,"" signing the tweet with his iconic phrase ""Live Long and Prosper.""

A life is like a garden. Perfect moments can be had, but not preserved, except in memory. LLAP

""I loved him like a brother. We will all miss his humor, his talent, and his capacity to love,"" his ""Star Trek"" co-star William Shatner said in a tweet.

Flowers will be placed on his star in on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 10:30 a.m. PT, officials said.

Nimoy -- a United States Army veteran, who was born in Boston, Massachusetts -- first began acting at the age of 8 locally, then in the early 1950's, staring in TV runs, such as ""The Silent Service,"" ""Broken Arrow"" and ""Dragnet."" But it was his debut as Mr. Spock in the 1960's ""Star Trek"" that made him a cult legend.

He first brought Mr. Spock to the screen in 1966 for the original ""Star Trek"" pilot, a character he played on TV until 1969. He would go on to star in eight movies and build a cult following as the half human, half Vulcan famous for his hand gesture that meant ""Live Long and Prosper.""

After a long and successful career since the beginning of ""Trek,"" Nimoy had brought back his famous role in 2009's reboot ""Star Trek,"" and the recent sequel ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" in 2013. Zachary Quinto played a younger version of Spock.

In an interview with StarTrek.com, Nimoy expressed his gratitude to reboot director J.J. Abrams for bringing him back to honor him in the new series.

""I think he’s done a great thing for Star Trek. I’m very grateful to him. We all owe him a lot. When someone comes along like he has done and picks it up and elevates it, we should be grateful. So when J.J. calls me, I take the call,"" he said.

But Nimoy was more than just an actor -- starring as of late as a voice in 2011's ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" and as Dr. William Bell in another cult classic series ""Fringe."" Nimoy began his career as an acting teacher in his early 20's in Hollywood, and more recently the author of his autobiographies, ""I Am Not Spock"" in 1975 and ""I Am Spock"" in 1995.

In addition to his over 130 acting credits, Nimoy had a dozen directing credits, including the 1987 hit ""3 Men and a Baby,"" starring Tom Selleck and Ted Danson and a couple ""Star Trek"" movies. Nimoy also starred as himself in hits like ""Futurama,"" ""Ancient Mysteries"" and ""In Search of..."" as a host in the late 1970's and early 1980's.

Somewhere in the middle of all his success, Nimoy went back to school and earned a master’s degree in Spanish from Antioch University Austin in his 40's, then later an honorary doctorate, according to the Times.

Nimoy was married twice - once to actoress Sandra Zober from 1954 to 1987 and most recently to Susan Bay from 1989 till his death. He is father to Julie and Adam Nimoy. His son, 58, followed in his famous father's footsteps, directing episodes on ""NYPD Blue,"" ""Gilmore Girls"" and ""The Practice.""

Nimoy is survived by his wife Susan Bay and his two children, Adam and Julie."

But it was his debut as Mr. Spock in the 1960's ""Star Trek"" that made him a cult legend.

He first brought Mr. Spock to the screen in 1966 for the original ""Star Trek"" pilot, a character he played on TV until 1969. He would go on to star in eight movies and build a cult following as the half human, half Vulcan famous for his hand gesture that meant ""Live Long and Prosper.""

After a long and successful career since the beginning of ""Trek,"" Nimoy had brought back his famous role in 2009's reboot ""Star Trek,"" and the recent sequel ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" in 2013. Zachary Quinto played a younger version of Spock.

In an interview with StarTrek.com, Nimoy expressed his gratitude to reboot director J.J. Abrams for bringing him back to honor him in the new series.

""I think he’s done a great thing for Star Trek. I’m very grateful to him. We all owe him a lot. When someone comes along like he has done and picks it up and elevates it, we should be grateful. So when J.J. calls me, I take the call,"" he said.

But Nimoy was more than just an actor -- starring as of late as a voice in 2011's ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" and as Dr. William Bell in another cult classic series ""Fringe."" Nimoy began his career as an acting teacher in his early 20's in Hollywood, and more recently the author of his autobiographies, ""I Am Not Spock"" in 1975 and ""I Am Spock"" in 1995.

In addition to his over 130 acting credits, Nimoy had a dozen directing credits, including the 1987 hit ""3 Men and a Baby,"" starring Tom Selleck and Ted Danson and a couple ""Star Trek"" movies. Nimoy also starred as himself in hits like ""Futurama,"" ""Ancient Mysteries"" and ""In Search of..."" as a host in the late 1970's and early 1980's.

Somewhere in the middle of all his success, Nimoy went back to school and earned a master’s degree in Spanish from Antioch University Austin in his 40's, then later an honorary doctorate, according to the Times.

Nimoy was married twice - once to actoress Sandra Zober from 1954 to 1987 and most recently to Susan Bay from 1989 till his death. He is father to Julie and Adam Nimoy. His son, 58, followed in his famous father's footsteps, directing episodes on ""NYPD Blue,"" ""Gilmore Girls"" and ""The Practice.""

Nimoy is survived by his wife Susan Bay and his two children, Adam and Julie."

Dash-cam footage from a police car in a high-speed chase in Arizona shows bales of marijuana being thrown at it from the window of the suspects' car ahead.

The pursuit, which reached speeds over 100 mph, turned into a short foot chase after the suspects stopped their car and fled, according to a statement on the Pinal County Sheriff's Office's Facebook. However, the two men were successfully stopped and arrested, and police also discovered a stash house in Mesa, AZ, the Pinal County Sheriff's Office said.

""These foreign drug smugglers try to outrun our deputies and even throw bales of marijuana from their vehicle,"" Pinal County Sheriff Paul Babeu said in a statement posted on Facebook. ""We caught these criminals who put our deputies and our local citizens in harm’s way, and now they will go to prison for their crimes.""

About 374 pounds of marijuana were recovered as evidence, the sheriff's office said, adding that not all the thrown pot was found because four or five vehicles not involved in the chase stopped to grab some of the tossed bales before police could get back to them.

The high-speed chase happened last Wednesday morning when a deputy officer was monitoring traffic on a Casa Grande highway, the sheriff's office said.

The officer noticed a 2006 White Trailblazer traveling much faster than the other vehicles on the roadway and attempted to stop the car. The vehicle led multiple police units on a high-speed chase.

The Trailblazer eventually went into the campus of Central Arizona College, where Pinal County Sheriff's deputies ahead of the chase set up spike strips that successfully deflated the Trailblazer's front tires, police said.

""Both occupants, later identified as Mario Perez-Paz (43 of Mexico) and Juan Aguilar-Zavala (21 of Unknown), exited the car and led deputies on a short foot pursuit, but were taken into custody,"" the Pinal County Sheriff's Office said in a statement.

Perez-Paz and Aguilar-Zavala said they were offered $1,000 by a female in Phoenix to drive the Trailblazer to pick up ""unknown packages,"" police said.

Both men were booked into the Pinal County Sheriff’s Jail on multiple drug charges and unlawful flight, police added.

From information developed from an earlier pursuit, Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials said they believe suspected smugglers' destination was a stash house in Mesa, where authorities discovered 20 undocumented immigrants from Guatemala and Mexico.

Babeu used the incident to criticize President Barack Obama's recent actions on immigration.

“This further proves that not only drugs like methamphetamine, cocaine and heroin are being smuggled into America by way of Arizona, but scores of illegals from Central America have never stopped,"" Babeu said. ""Meanwhile, President Obama continues to violate US immigration law and instead prioritizes the needs and concerns of illegals ahead of American citizens. This further undermines the rule of law and our current immigration process that currently allows more foreigners to lawfully immigrate into America every year than every other nation combined."""
18vPzfD,2015-03-09 00:00:00,Gold Apple (AAPL) Watch Edition Takes on Competing $10K Luxury Timepieces - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Business/apple-watch-luxury-timepieces-10k-gold-aapl-watch/story?id=29502077,"Apple's upcoming $10,000 gold smartwatch will cost what is to most people a small fortune. Can the gold Apple watch hold up its value as well as some other luxury watches do?

Each Apple Watch ""Edition"" will be made of 18-karat gold, which is twice as hard as standard gold, and sapphire crystal, according to Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL).

The Edition smartwatch faces competition from a wide range of ""benchmark"" Swiss watches that can cost $5,000 to $10,000, before competing with the higher-priced, ultra-luxury watches. But unlike these watches, the resale value for old Apple products typically diminishes significantly. For example, older iPhone models are typically sold with deep discounts.

Here are some other sought-after watches that focus on time at similar price points to the 18-karat gold Apple Watch Edition.

1. $8,985: Rolex Submariner

Rolex's Submariner watch can be called either a ""quintessential"" or ""generic"" Rolex, depending on the watch collector's view. Various versions cost anywhere from $7,000 to $10,000. One Submariner with Swiss automatic movement, stainless steel and ""anti-reflective"" sapphire is listed for $8,985 on Amazon.com. Because of the Swiss Rolex brand and ""prestige"" of this watch, it holds value on the resale market much better than most watches, according to this Forbes column.

2. $9,395: Panerai Radiomir

Water resistant to 330 feet with a 47-mm case, this watch is made by Italian watchmaker Panerai and priced at $9,395 on Amazon.com. The company say it combines ""the design and the Italian creativity with Swiss technology.""

3. $10,100: Jaeger-LeCoultre Master Ultra Thin Moon 39

Luxury Swiss watchmaker Jaeger-LeCoultre goes super-narrow with a 4.9-mm thick watch with a ""moon-phase display"" that, you guessed it, shows the phase of the moon. Some collectors appreciate the feature for its utility, where others just appreciate the technical or aesthetic aspect. The sapphire crystal case back reveals the movement of the watch.

4. $10,471: IWC Portuguese Automatic

Priced at $10,470.98 via Amazon, this IWC watch's model year is 2011. Amazon says the stainless steel watch's listing price was $14,100.

5. $10,600: Jaeger-LeCoultre Master Chronograph

With a 40-mm diameter case, the Jaeger-LeCoultre Master Chronograph watch has a convex dial with a ""pulsometer scale.""

The watch, in yellow or rose gold, will be sold on April 24 and available to pre-order on April 10. The Apple Watch will be available first in these nine places: Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, United Kingdom and United States."
18vYWNo,2015-03-02 00:00:00,'We Call It Life Row': Two of the Youngest US Women on Death Row Describe Life Behind Bars - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/US/call-life-row-youngest-us-women-death-row/story?id=29165934,"When Tiffany Cole and Emilia Carr walk down the hall in Florida’s Lowell Correctional Institution for Women together, they seem more like smiling girlfriends than convicted felons sitting on death row.

Cole is now 33, and Carr is now 30. Carr is the youngest woman in the United States sitting on death row, and Cole is the third youngest. The two women are behind bars for committing two separate crimes, and they had separate lives until they arrived as neighbors on the famous death row corridor at the women’s correctional facility in Ocala, Florida.

“We call it ‘life row,’” Carr said. “It’s life row ... because we’re not dying, we’re living.”

Carr, who is from Ocala, and Cole, from Jacksonville, Florida, share a similar path.

Prior to their incarcerations, neither had ever spent a night in jail, they said. Cole played the flute in high school, and participated in cheerleading and Girl Scouts. Carr was book smart and modeled, she said, and was in the school Marines, which was her high school's Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) program.

Both said they were sexually abused and got into trouble after they met the “wrong people.”

“[I was] looking for love in all the wrong places,” Cole said.

When she was 25 years old, Cole was convicted on murder charges after being connected to the death of her family’s neighbors, Reggie and Carol Sumner, who suffocated to death from dirt in their lungs when they were buried alive. She has acknowledged she helped dig a grave, but said she thought it would be to hide the items that she, her boyfriend, a guy she had known for three weeks and two of his friends had stolen from their victims. A psychiatrist at Cole’s trial said she suffered from mental problems and had a history of drug and alcohol abuse.

“I am not the same person anymore,” Cole said. “I have peace, I have joy. I have a sound mind.”

The jury was shown a damning photo of her celebrating after the crime was committed. She was given the death penalty, which she is in the process of appealing.

Carr was 26 years old and eight months pregnant with her boyfriend’s child when they were both convicted of suffocating his wife with duct tape and a plastic bag. Carr argued she left the scene before the woman was killed.

“Wouldn’t there have been physical evidence? I mean, duct tape is some sticky stuff, yet there’s no finger prints, no DNA, no hair,” Carr said.

But there is video of Carr being interviewing by police, recorded after her boyfriend confessed and implicated her in the crime. On the tape, Carr is heard telling an officer that the boyfriend asked her to “try to snap her neck,” and then Carr says, “I didn’t really try.”

She was convicted of capital murder and given the death penalty, which she is in the process of appealing.

Legal experts say the average appeals process takes 10 to 12 years for death row inmates. Carr has been on death row for four years, while Cole has been on death row for seven years.

Both women are reluctant to give details about their cases under appeal, but both insist the murders they were convicted of were done at the hand of their boyfriends, not them. Both say they are not arguing for their release, just for their lives, to have their executions stayed.

Both refuse to believe they will be executed.

“You can’t have that mentality, because that means you've accepted this,” Carr said.

“You've already died... you’re already dead,” if you accept that, Cole said.

In response to Cole appealing her conviction, the prosecutor who handled her case, Jay Plotkin, said in a statement to ABC News, “I was a prosecutor for more than 20 years. There was not any case that I prosecuted where the crime was more vile or cruel than the torture and murder of the Sumners. This case lingers on in the heart and soul of our community. Ms. Cole is certainly entitled to, and should, exhaust all of her legal rights to appeal. I am personally confident that she received more than adequate representation and a fair trial.”

The prosecutor in Carr’s case, Rock Hooker, declined to comment to ABC News while the appeals process was still pending.

According to the National Academy of Sciences, one in 25 people on death row is innocent."
18w1aeH,2015-03-09 00:00:00,"Sam Simon, 'Simpsons' Co-Creator, Dead at 59 - ABC News",http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/sam-simon-simpsons-creator-dead-59/story?id=29508699,"Sam Simon, co-creator of ""The Simpsons,"" died Sunday after a long battle with colon cancer, his foundation confirmed via Facebook today. He was 59.

""It is with much sadness that we must let you know that Sam Simon has passed over,"" the message read. ""We all miss him, and in his honor, we will continue bringing his vision to light through our work at The Sam Simon Foundation. We take comfort in knowing how many greetings he is receiving across that Rainbow Bridge. We love you Sam!""

Another Facebook page for his foundation added, ""He passed away peacefully in his own bed, in his own home, surrounded by people and a dog who loved him.""

The creative mind behind one of the longest, most successful shows in TV history had been vocal about his battle with the disease that eventually took his life. One of his last tweets was March 1 when he shared a picture of him at the doctor's getting his lungs drained.

Simon, who was a Los Angeles native, was diagnosed in 2012 and been given just months to live. In the three years he dealt with the disease, he kept his fans updated via social media and his pictures in the hospital were always candid and showed his humor in dealing with cancer.

No port. I'm getting old school. Iv. Nurse Julie is painless! pic.twitter.com/iB07w5p5pw

In an interview last year with Vanity Fair, Simon was open about giving his fortune - upwards of $100 million -- away to charities that were close to his heart, including animal rights. Simon was fiercely protective of all animals -- bears, chimps, dogs, dolphins and elephants. He also started a program called Feeding Families, which was a vegan food bank for 400 families in California.

Simon, who co-created ""The Simpsons"" with Matt Groening and James L. Brooks in the late 1980's, told the magazine how his obsession with helping other causes began.

""I'm an atheist, but there's a thing called tithing that a lot of religions do. Ten percent was the minimum you were supposed to give to charity every year. And I always outdid that,"" he said.

Carolyn Miles, president and CEO of Save the Children, said Simon supported the organization for decades.

""He gave a voice to children and endangered animals who can't speak up for themselves,"" Miles said. ""And he gave away his fortune so that they may have a chance at a better life.

""Sam once told me: 'Giving -- I get pleasure from it. I love it. I don't feel like it's an obligation. In fact, nothing is as gratifying as knowing that my giving has changed lives, especially the lives of children,'"" she said.

He was such a large donor to organizations like PETA that the organization named a headquarters after him.

After news of his death broke, PETA President Ingrid Newkirk told ABC News in a statement ""I think Sam died with a smile on his face, knowing that elephants were on their way out of the circus, something that, together with the closure of SeaWorld, he dreamt of and talked about all the time. He said the last two years of his life, since his diagnosis, were his happiest, as he used them to help animals who had nothing, and it gave him great joy to see chimpanzees, elephants, and even a ""gay"" bull find freedom from harm because he had worked with PETA to get them all out of hideous circumstances.""

It was his missions and causes that inspired Simon and kept him moving forward long past the date doctors assumed he would have passed."
18w2CyE,2015-02-27 00:00:00,Leprosy Cases Hit Florida Counties - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Health/leprosy-cases-hit-florida-counties/story?id=29258128,"Some people might think of leprosy as a scourge from biblical times, but it still afflicts victims -- and a Florida county is reporting a rare increase in cases, with three people diagnosed in just five months.

In the past decade, before the new cases, only one person in Volusia County, Florida, was diagnosed with the disease.

Health officials there said the recent increase in cases was unexpected, but because the incubation period ranges from nine months to 20 years, they did not think the three new cases signaled a wave of new infections.

Leprosy, also known as Hansen's disease, is caused by a bacteria called Mycobacterium lepra. An infection mainly affects the skin, peripheral nerves, eyes and part of the upper respiratory tract, according to the World Health Organization.

Leprosy cases remain rare in the United States, with approximately 80 people reporting infections each year, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control.

Florida typically sees just eight to 10 cases per year. Leprosy is more common in California, Florida, Hawaii, Louisiana, Massachusetts, New York and Texas, according to a 2009 report from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Health Resources and Services Administration.

In addition to Volusia County, health officials in nearby Brevard County, Florida, have seen a recent increase in cases, with 18 reported over the last five years. Of the eight people diagnosed with leprosy in Florida last year, three were from Brevard County.

Barry Inman, an epidemiologist for Brevard County Department of Health, said the number of cases remained small but was much higher than previous decades, when they would normally see around one case a year.

""This is hard to track,"" said Inman, who noted the disease can incubate from nine months to 20 years.

""Compared to past history, it is significant and they are looking at it,"" Inman said of the local health department.

Inman said some of those were infected after interacting with armadillos, a known carrier of the disease.

The U.S. Centers of Disease Control and Prevention recommends people avoid contact armadillos to limit the possibility they can contract the bacteria that causes leprosy.

Symptoms of leprosy include skin lesions that may be faded or discolored, thick, stiff or dry skin, numbness in affected areas, ulcers on the soles of feet or muscle weakness or paralysis.

An estimated one to two million people have been permanently disabled by the disease. Today, the disease can be treated with antibiotics, although a course of treatment can be lengthy, lasting between six months to two years according to the U.S. Centers of Disease Control and Prevention."
18W2uIx,2015-02-07 00:00:00,"Controversial Guardrail Passes 4 Tests, Another Prompts Questions - ABC News",http://abcnews.go.com/US/controversial-guardrail-passes-tests-prompts-questions/story?id=28789783,"The government today released results of the first set of crash tests it ordered on a controversial highway guardrail system, giving the ET-Plus a “pass” grade in the first four of eight tests conducted this winter in San Antonio – but an upcoming release may not be so clear cut, according to an accident expert.

The popular guardrail system, found on highways across the country, has been blamed for gruesome injuries and deaths after it was modified years ago without the knowledge of federal and state officials. More than half of U.S. states have stopped installing the guardrail, pending the outcome of the tests.

In a statement, the Federal Highway Administration’s Acting Administrator Gregory Nadeau said the crash tests “are not the end of our work to determine the safety of this device,” adding that the agency plans to address other safety questions that have been raised about the embattled highway device.

“We’ve said from day one that, when it came to testing, we weren’t going to do this one task, check a box and be done with it,” Nadeau said.

Trinity Industries of Texas, the manufacturer of the guardrail end terminal, said today the results “validate” the company’s “long standing position” that if installed and maintained correctly on the highway, the ET-Plus it will perform as intended. The company says it remains confident in the performance of the ET-Plus.

In total eight tests were conducted by Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, where an ABC News producer was present at each of the closed crash tests as a media pool representative. The first four tests were conducted with the end terminals at a height of 27 ¾ inches. The second set was at a height of 31 inches. The results of the last four tests are currently being analyzed and expected to be released in the coming weeks.

But in the wake of what could look like a clean sweep for Trinity’s embattled product, questions are now being raised about the results of the eighth and final test conducted on Jan. 27, which one expert, who says he reviewed photos and videos of the test, is calling a “clear failure.” In helicopter video shot by ABC News affiliate KSAT, the small vehicle can be seen significantly damaged on the driver’s side upon impact. Although the guardrail does not appear to pierce the cabin of the car, the door is clearly crushed inward.

Late Thursday, an expert witness – who testified against Trinity in an earlier Texas federal whistleblower case – filed an affidavit saying “the guardrail buckled and began violently penetrating the occupant compartment.”

The impact, writes civil engineer and accident expert Brian Coon, “not only could have caused disabling injuries, but showed a propensity to penetrate the vehicle and cause devastating injuries” and was a “clear failure” under the guidelines followed for the safe performance of guardrails.

An ABC News “20/20” investigation in September looked into allegations from crash victims that the modified guardrail end terminal could malfunction when struck from the front by their vehicles. Rather than ribboning out and absorbing the impact as designed, the modified, 4-inch guardrails “locked up” and speared straight through the cars, severing the motorists’ limbs in some cases. The ABC News investigation discovered that in a company email, a Trinity Industries employee noted that the modification would save $2 per guardrail – approximately $50,000 per year."
18xOmFE,2015-02-28 00:00:00,Anthony Mason dies at age of 48 - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/anthony-mason-dies-age-48/story?id=29292525,"A Knicks spokesperson confirmed to ESPN that Mason died early Saturday morning. The 13-year NBA veteran had been diagnosed with congestive heart failure earlier this month.

""First I want to thank all those who offered prayers and well-wishes for my Father, our family really appreciates it,"" his son, Anthony Mason Jr., said Saturday. ""Overnight, New York City and the world lost a legend, a friend, a brother ... but more than anything our father, Anthony Mason. As you all would expect our father -- Big Mase -- put up an incredible fight, dealing with a severe heart issue. I'm wishing this was something else I was writing, but Pops we've got to let you know we love you and know you'll always be with us.""

Mason's other son  Antoine, a senior basketball player at  Auburn, had said earlier this week that his father was ""getting better"" following multiple heart surgeries.

Mason's family released a statement Saturday morning, saying that he ""fought like a warrior to the very end.""

""We would like to thank everyone for their heartfelt thoughts and strong prayers,"" the statement said. ""Anthony felt each and every one. He fought like a warrior to the very end. Please keep your prayers and thoughts with us through this very hard time -- it is a great loss for us. We ask for our privacy during this time.""

Mason played for six teams but was best remembered for his five-year tenure with the Knicks. Mason's bruising, physical play epitomized then-coach Pat Riley's Knicks teams. The 6-foot-7 forward became a fan favorite for his physical play and also drew attention for the creative artwork and messages that he had carved in his hair cuts.

Mason teamed with Patrick Ewing, Charles Oakley and John Starks to help the Knicks win the Eastern Conference in 1994 and reach the NBA Finals, where they lost to the Houston Rockets in seven games.

""My heart is heavy after learning that we lost Anthony Mason last night,"" Ewing said in a statement. ""We were teammates on the Knicks for five great seasons. Mase came to play every night and was always ready to go to battle with me every time we stepped on the court together.

""I will remember him for his strength, determination and perseverance. My thoughts are with his family. May he rest in peace.""

Oakley took to Twitter to send his condolences.

Knicks president Phil Jackson, who coached against Mason during his time with the  Chicago Bulls, also released a statement Saturday.

""As a competitor, there was none fiercer than Anthony Mason,"" Jackson said. ""Standing on the opposite end of the playing field, coaching in those great Chicago/New York battles, No. 14 in Orange and Blue always stood out. On behalf of the entire Knickerbocker community, our condolences go out to his family.""

Mason won the NBA's Sixth Man Award in 1994-95 as a member of the Knicks. He also played with the Charlotte Hornets, Milwaukee Bucks and Miami Heat following his stint with the Knicks."

Brody and Susan Pettit, the parents of Levi Pettit, released a statement Tuesday saying they were ""shocked and saddened"" by what they saw in the video.

""As parents of Levi, we love him and care for him deeply,"" they said. ""He made a horrible mistake, and will live with the consequences forever. However, we also know the depth of our son's character. He is a good boy, but what we saw in those videos is disgusting.

""While it may be difficult for those who only know Levi from the video to understand, we know his heart, and he is not a racist,"" they said. ""We raised him to be loving and inclusive and we all remain surrounded by a diverse, close-knit group of friends.""

Levi Pettit is the second of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon members seen in the video to be identified.

The president of Jesuit College Preparatory School of Dallas said the fraternity member apparently ""leading"" the racist chant on a bus full of students is a recent graduate of the high school.

""In the recent video regarding OU and the SAE [Sigma Alpha Epsilon] fraternity, it appears that a graduate from Jesuit Dallas is leading the racist chant,"" according to a statement by Mike Earsing, the president of Jesuit Dallas, which has confirmed its former student's name as Parker Rice, 19.

""I am appalled by the actions in the video and extremely hurt by the pain this has caused our community. It is unconscionable and very sad that in 2015 we still live in a society where this type of bigotry and racism takes place.""

Earsing added, ""Unfortunately, isolated incidents throughout our society remind us that there is still much work to be done.""

ABC News has been unable to reach Rice. The Jesuit Dallas Alumni Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

University of Oklahoma student Matthew Lopez, who lived on the same residence hall floor as Rice in Norman, Oklahoma, said ""he's a person of high moral fiber,"" and, ""someone that's tolerant of other people and their different cultures and their different backgrounds.

""I know Parker,"" Lopez told ABC News. ""He's not a racist.""

The University of Oklahoma, citing privacy laws, declined to name two students it expelled in connection to the now-viral video. So it was unclear whether Rice or Pettit were among the two expelled students.

University of Oklahoma President David Boren said the students who played a leadership role in the ""exclusionary"" chant had created a hostile learning environment. He said the chant was heard not only by those on a bus, but also affected the entire university community because it was distributed through social media.

Boren said, ""I have emphasized that there is zero tolerance for this kind of threatening racist behavior at the University of Oklahoma. I hope that the entire nation will join us in having zero tolerance of such racism when it raises its ugly head in other situations across our country.""

He continued, ""I am extremely proud of the reaction and response expressed by our entire university family -- students, faculty, staff, and alumni about this incident. They are 'Real Sooners' who believe in mutual respect for all. I hope that students involved in this incident will learn from this experience and realize that it is wrong to use words to hurt, threaten and exclude other people. We will continue our investigation of all the students engaged in the singing of this chant. Once their identities have been confirmed, they will be subject to appropriate disciplinary action.""

According to Boren's letter, if the expelled students disagree with the decision, they can contact the school's Equal Opportunity Office by this Friday.

The president of the university's Black Student Association, Isaac Hill, a 20-year-old engineering major, said he agreed with the president's decision to expel two of the students involved because ""those people don't deserve to carry the title that comes with being a student here."""

Tom Cotton and 46 of his Republican colleagues sent this week to the leaders of Iran, warning them that any nuclear deal they sign with President Obama won’t last after Obama leaves office, might be a crime.

That letter from the Arkansas Republican to the ayatollahs and other Iranian officials, critics say, is a violation of the 1799 Logan Act, which says starkly:

“This [letter] seems squarely to satisfy the elements of the law,” Temple University law professor Peter Spiro declared, suggesting a crime has occurred here.

But hold on.

In the 215-plus years the Logan Act has been on the books, there’s only been one indictment against someone for breaking the law, in 1803, and the case fell apart before trial.

And what the GOP senators are doing here, while rare, is hardly unprecedented.

For instance, in 1920, 88 members of the House of Representatives sent a cable to British Prime Minister David Lloyd George and the British Parliament to protest against Britain’s treatment of Irish prisoners being held without arraignment or trial. This was directly contrary to the policy of President Woodrow Wilson, who sought closer relations with Great Britain at the time, and who did not support Ireland’s push for independence.

In 1927, the Senate’s anti-imperialist “peace progressives,” led by Sen. William Borah, R-Idaho), wrote directly to the Mexican president in an effort to renegotiate oil leases granted to U.S. oil companies under an agreement reached by President Coolidge.

In 1975, Sens. John Sparkman, D-Ala., and George McGovern, D-S.D., traveled to Cuba to negotiate directly with Fidel Castro about easing relations.

And the practice goes all the way back to the beginning of the country, when the House (dominated by fiery pro-French Jeffersonians) voted a resolution of approval of the radical French constitution of 1792, despite President George Washington’s desperate efforts to keep his fledgling country neutral in the great European wars that were unfolding.

The bottom line: As the great scholar Edward Corwin put it, “the Constitution … is an invitation to struggle for the privilege of directing American foreign policy.”

Cotton and his colleagues in Congress are waging that old struggle anew. Whether their “open letter” to the ayatollahs is wise is another matter.

(Cotton apparently fancies himself a constitutional scholar. In fact, he declares that the Iranian leadership “may not fully understand our constitutional system.” But his letter contains a pretty egregious constitutional error, one that would get him marked down sharply on a first-year con-law paper).

He writes that “the Senate must ratify [a treaty] by a two-thirds vote.”

But the Senate does not “ratify” anything. Ever. The Senate advises and consents to treaties and other international agreements, and the president, in the name of the United States, ratifies them as binding law on the country in its international relations.

This fact is not obscure. It is not hard to find. Indeed, a senator can find it on the Senate’s own webpage:

“The Senate does not ratify treaties. Instead, the Senate takes up a resolution of ratification, by which the Senate formally gives its advice and consent, empowering the president to proceed with ratification.”"

""Several other incidents with chapters or members have been brought to the attention of the headquarters staff and leaders, and each of those instances will be investigated for further action,"" the apologetic fraternity said in a statement Monday night.

The national office, which has disbanded the local chapter, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The video, which surfaced over the weekend, was posted to Twitter by Unheard, which describes itself as ""an alliance of black students organized for change within campus administration and atmosphere.""

The video shows young men on a bus chanting, ""There will never be a n***** at SAE.""

The Unheard tweet, directed at OU president David Boren, said, ""Racism is alive at The University of Oklahoma.""

Boren said in a statement Monday that all ties and affiliations between the school and chapter are ""hereby severed.""

As for the song, a former member of the Oklahoma SAE chapter told ABC News he doesn't know whether it originated at Oklahoma or elsewhere.

""I hope it didn't start where I was,"" said Will James, an SAE at Oklahoma from 2001 to 2005. ""But I really don't know.""

James, 31, believes he was the second African-American member of the Oklahoma SAE chapter and doesn't think there has been another since him.

The Edmond, Oklahoma, musician said he thinks the racist song has ""probably"" been sung at other SAE chapters.

""We would find songs from other chapters,"" he said, adding, ""singing on the bus rides is a tradition we did.""

But James said they didn't sing ""anything like that song"" when he was a student. ""When I was there, I don't believe anyone would have stood for anything like that,"" he said.

SAE has an official song book, James said, as well as ""songs that just rise out of tradition.""

He said most of the official songs were about fraternity symbolism, while the songs that came from tradition ""celebrated drinking and partying."" But ""no one was ever taken down by any song we had,"" he added.

While James said he no longer has a copy of the song book, he said the racist chant was ""definitely not in the official book.""

""When we have those bus rides to date parties, we would sing our songs from the book and what we picked up from tradition,"" he said. ""Everyone knew the words and sang along.""

James said he considered the chapter diverse when he was in school.

""There were Middle Eastern members, there were Hispanic members, we were all over the place,"" he said. ""We had various socioeconomic backgrounds and nobody cared, it was inclusive. And so, I just I can't imagine how that culture has shifted so far to allow that song, or any song that would be disparaging to anybody is happening at that house."""

The nearly 9-pound baby girl had a rare condition called fetus-in-fetu, which happens when a partially developed fetus becomes incorporated into a normally developing fetus (its twin) in the womb. This condition affects about 1 in 500,000 births, according to the case study published in the Hong Kong Medical Journal this month.

Each structure included a spine, intestines, bones with bone marrow, ""primitive"" brain matter, a rib cage and an umbilical cord, according to the study. The study authors said the partially formed fetuses and the baby girl shared the same DNA, fitting a popular theory that the woman was initially pregnant with identical triplets, but researchers aren't sure this is what happened.

Judging by the body parts they found in the baby girl, the doctors determined that the absorbed twins could have been up to 10 weeks old before their growth stopped and they were absorbed. But the mechanism for this ""absorption"" is not fully understood, the study authors wrote, so it's also possible the extra fetuses were absorbed earlier and grew with the baby girl in the womb.

The authors suggested that perhaps these structures may have been a teratoma, a kind of tumor containing different types of tissue that is usually seen in women of reproductive age, rather than absorbed identical siblings.

Dr. Jane Corteville, an OB/GYN at University Hospitals Case Medical Center in Cleveland, Ohio, who has studied teratomas and fetus-in-fetu, said it's not clear exactly what happened since doctors didn't catch the growth in the first five weeks of gestation. Corteville, who didn't see the Hong Kong baby, said fetus-in-fetu is so rare that in her 30-year career, she's only seen one case like this.

""I think we see these on occasion and they're bizarre,"" she said. ""And I think they do give us kind of some insight maybe -- but not very much -- into what happens during early development.""

To better understand them, she said doctors would have to pick them up at the beginning of pregnancy, but the fetuses and the masses are too little to see.

The Hong Kong baby underwent surgery to have the masses removed, according to the researchers."

""Pembroke Welsh Corgis"" are joining their cousins, the ""Cardigan Welsh Corgis,"" and 28 other breeds on the list, which is updated each year by the Kennel Club, a British organization promoting the health and welfare of dogs.

Last year, registration numbers for Pembroke Welsh Corgi puppies were at 274, falling under the 300 threshold needed to stay off the list. They had been on a watch list for the past four years when the number fell under 450.
While overall numbers of Corgis are estimated between 4,000 and 5,000 in the United Kingdom and Ireland, Caroline Kisko from the Kennel Club told ABC News there had been a 16 percent drop since 2013.

Why are the numbers declining? Because celebrities aren't buying Corgis, Kisko said. ""It makes sense when you look at the increased popularity of exotic breeds: French bulldogs registrations have gone up from 350 in 2004 to 9,000 last year.”

“People are daft,” Kisko said, “because celebrity isn’t a good reason to buy a dog. Corgis are for everyone. They are fun, intelligent and active. We want people to do their research before buying a dog.”

Not everyone believes in the celebrity factor. Diana King, chairwoman of the Welsh Corgi League, told ABC News she believes the decline is due to a 2007 ban on tail-docking (the practice of cutting off the animal’s tail) in the U.K.

King said she also believes the lack of breeders in the U.K. is to blame.

""Fifty years ago there was a large choice of breeders,” said King, “but now we mostly have hobby breeders, who aren’t breeding properly. They’re not looking at the dog pedigree, and seem to be going for the cheap stud irrespective of whether it complements their female Corgi.”

For example, King said she has noticed that many Pembroke Corgis have to get caesarean sections, which is costly, and could be a result of breeding the dogs too low to the ground.

Britain’s favorite dog remains the Labrador, with more than 36,000 puppies born last year, according to the Kennel Club. Cocker spaniels and Springer spaniels came in second and third."
192TNwe,2015-02-09 00:00:00,The Scary Things Hackers Can Do to Your Car - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Business/scary-things-hackers-car/story?id=28831616,"Nearly all new cars on the market include wireless technology that make drivers vulnerable to hacking or an invasion of privacy, according to a report released today.

The report, titled ""Tracking and Hacking: Security and Privacy Gaps Put American Drivers at Risk,"" was released by Sen. Edward Markey, D-Mass.

For the report, he used feedback from the 16 major car manufacturers who responded, including BMW, Chrysler, Ford, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai and Jaguar Land Rover.

As for the security concerns, one expert expressed sentiments similar to Markey's.

""Automobiles have become increasingly more connected, creating both opportunities as well as vulnerabilities, through wireless networks,"" credit security expert Adam Levin, chairman and founder of IDT911, told ABC News today.

Though Markey and Levin didn't cite actual incidents, here are some things that hackers could do potentially with access to your car and its information:

1. Car movement

In a 2013 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) study cited by Markey, researchers used a laptop to see how they could control two cars from different manufacturers. They were able to cause the cars to ""suddenly accelerate, kill the brakes, activate the horn"" and more, according to the report.

Levin said the frightening scenarios of thieves stealing property or exposing drivers and their children to carjacking by unlocking car doors or imprisoning them by locking the doors are within reach. He adds that exposing drivers to accidents is another malicious activity that could happen.

2. Modify car indicators

In the same 2013 DARPA study, the researchers could also modify the speedometer and gas gauge readings and control the headlights. Last year, the same researchers analyzed the ""hackability"" of 21 different car models from 10 manufacturers and found varying levels of security for each car with respect to wireless entry points.

Of the 16 car makers that responded to Markey’s letter, 14 provided the percentage of 2013 model year cars that have wireless entry points and projections for their 2014 vehicles. Eleven of those 14 said 100 percent of their cars have wireless entry points and some cited the federal mandate for tire pressure monitoring systems as the major contributor.

3. Reading data

While car manufacturers sometimes collect data from vehicle technologies to improve safety or the customer experience, others could access driver data for malicious purposes, the report states. The report mentions previous research that shows one can ""remotely and wireless access a vehicle's network through Bluetooth connections, OnStar systems, malware in a synced Android smartphone, or a malicious file on a CD in the stereo.""

""While I understand that vehicle manufacturers have begun the process of exchanging threat assessments and are communicating more with transportation safety officials, it is critical that we treat this matter with urgency,"" Levin told ABC News.

4. Finding a driver's location

Markey refers to the increasing use of navigation or other technologies that could be used to record someone's location or driving history.

""A number of new services have emerged that permit the collection of a wide range of user data, providing valuable information not just to improve vehicle performance, but also potentially for commercial and law enforcement purposes,"" the report states.

5. Disabling a car

Car dealerships and navigation systems providers also use ""remote disabling"" to track and disable cars if drivers fall behind on payments, or if cars are stolen.

Millions of these devices are on the road, including the PassTime GPS tracker that helped catch Delvin Barnes, accused last year of kidnapping Carlesha Freeland-Gaither of Philadelphia.

Corinne Kirkendall, vice president of compliance and public relations for PassTime, told ABC News in November that the company requires dealers to obtain written consent from drivers acknowledging that the device is on the car and how it is used. All dealers must follow laws regulating the collection of personal information, she said.

Spokesman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers Wade Newton said the trade group hasn’t fully reviewed the report but released a statement that said, “Manufacturers today employ a variety of methods to provide consumers with clear notices of their privacy practices, including through owner’s manuals and company websites.”

“Auto engineers incorporate security solutions into vehicles from the very first stages of design and production – and security testing never stops,” Newton said in the statement.

In January, the alliance, an association of 12 major manufacturers, signed on as a “Champion of Data Privacy Day 2015.”"

There’s a good chance that if you want it then it is being manufactured in some factory or put together by one of its 1.3 billion citizens. So when I was in Beijing last week I assumed that we could find Apple’s Watch well before it's officially released.

With our research we found good news and bad news. The good news was that we did find a watch that looks like an official Apple Watch with the same color and shape. The bad news was it is a counterfeit. A knock-off. A fake.

I learned about this because the story was being told in newspapers.

We heard there were two possible knock-offs. One called Ai Watch and the other called the D-Watch. We were told that we could buy one of them in a few stores but we took the easier route to buy online from a company called Taobao.

It is like eBay and Amazon put together. But this company is owned by Alibaba, which is growing fast. With our ABC Visa card our associate producer ordered one last Thursday when I was about to board the plane heading home to New York. In a perfect world I could have bought it online and had them mail it directly to my office in the US. But no. Taobao could only send it to an address in China. So when our Beijing team got it they had to send it here, where I got the chance to open it.

What can I say? The differences between the real one and the fake one are huge. On the knock-off there is a screen, but not a touch screen. If you expect an iPhone on your wrist then please just give up. According to the instructions you can use Bluetooth to connect to your phone but only with Android. No chance you can connect to any Apple devices.

So if you want to brag and show off then go ahead and buy one of these. They are much cheaper. We bought ours for $47 instead of the $350 for a real one. It could look good on your wrist but only from afar. Keep it away from the eyes of your friends."

Todd Jones Stepping Down After Nearly 4 Years on Job - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/atf-director-todd-jones-stepping-years-job/story?id=29779602,"The man brought in to repair one of the nation’s top law enforcement agencies after it was scarred by a gun-running scandal is stepping down, ABC News has learned.

Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives Director B. Todd Jones has informed Attorney General Eric Holder he plans to resign, effective March 31. Jones has secured a new job in the private sector in New York City, and may be joining a professional sports league, ABC News was told.

Jones, 57, first took charge of the agency in August 2011, holding the position in an “acting” capacity until the U.S. Senate confirmed his presidential nomination nearly two years later. ATF had been without a Senate-confirmed leader for seven years.

During that time, the ATF and the Justice Department, more broadly, were blindsided by the “Fast and Furious” scandal, named for the ATF-led investigation in Arizona that put guns into the hands of criminals in Mexico, two of which ended up at the murder scene of a U.S. Border Patrol agent in late 2010.

In the wake of the scandal, President Obama then tapped Jones to chart a new course for the ATF. At the time, Jones was serving double-duty, holding onto his position as U.S. attorney – the Justice Department’s top prosecutor – in Minnesota.

Once confirmed, though, Jones left the U.S. attorney’s office, devoting his full attention to what ATF’s website says is “the unique law enforcement agency within the U.S. Department of Justice with the responsibility for enforcing firearms and explosives laws that protect communities from violent criminals and criminal organizations.”

Some within the agency and on Capitol Hill say privately that, besides improving morale, Jones has done a reasonably good job of reforming some of ATF’s management practices that led to problems like “Fast and Furious.”

“ATF employees are hard-working, dedicated individuals who serve the public to make our nation safer every day,” Jones said in a statement confirming his departure. “I have seen firsthand their extraordinary commitment to combatting violent crime, ridding the streets of criminals, and leveraging all available resources to keep our communities safe.”

Last month, controversy simmered across the country again when the ATF proposed banning certain .223-caliber bullets, which the ATF warned can break through a supposedly bullet-proof vest. Nevertheless, the public outcry and pressure from lawmakers prompted ATF to abandon its plans.

Before becoming U.S. Attorney in Minnesota at the start of the Obama administration, Jones was a partner with a major national law firm in Minneapolis, according to his official biography on ATF’s website.

After receiving his law degree from the University of Minnesota in 1983, he went on active duty in the U.S. Marine Corps, serving as an infantry officer with the First Marine Division and, subsequently, both a trial defense counsel and prosecutor in a number of court martial proceedings, his official biography says. Though he left active duty and returned to Minnesota in 1989, he was recalled to active duty in 1991 for Operation Desert Storm, stationed at Camp Pendleton, California.

ATF Deputy Director Thomas Brandon will serve as acting director after Jones steps down, the ATF said. Brandon -- a 26-year veteran of the ATF -- was appointed deputy director in October 2011."

Kay Hafford has been identified as the 28-year-old who was driving on I-45 this morning when another driver allegedly shot her from his vehicle.

The altercation took place after Hafford got onto the interstate and honked her horn at a driver in a white SUV, police said.

""She let him know by blowing her horn that he shouldn't have cut her off,"" her husband Kendrick Hafford told reporters.

Hafford honked her horn at a white SUV after getting on Interstate 45, which Harris County assistant Chief Deputy Mark Herman said led to the suspect heckling her.

Hafford's husband told ABC News that his wife works as a customer service representative at Centerpoint Energy and was on her way to work at the time of the shooting.

She was able to pull over and call 911 after the suspect fired one shot at her right window and only realized that she was bleeding while she was talking to the operator.

Herman said that she was in and out of consciousness during the call. While talking to first responders, she was able to give them her husband's contact information and he arrived at the scene before she was transported to a nearby hospital, police said.

""She blacked out several times at the scene but she was coherent enough to give investigators some information about the case,"" Herman added.

There were other calls made to 911 about a driver in a white SUV and now investigators are trying to track the driver, who they believe is a man who was wearing a blue baseball cap. He was last seen going southbound on I-45.

""I'm truly, truly upset. It could have been a lot worse,"" her husband said, calling her ""a tough cookie."""

Literally.

When the piece of mail -- containing a plastic bag and a suspicious liquid -- was initially tested at an off-site screening facility, the results came back negative for toxins. But another test the next day suggested the envelope might contain cyanide, so it was sent for further testing.

The results of the final testing are in: That liquid is saliva. And it did contain trace amounts of cyanide.

How do investigators think the cyanide got there?

The sender is believed to be a homeless man from the Chicago area who apparently smokes excessively, producing trace amounts of cyanide in his saliva, according to sources familiar with the case.

“Smoking cigarettes is probably one of the major sources of cyanide exposure for people who do not work in cyanide-related industries,” according to the Centers for Disease Control.

It is unclear whether authorities will charge the man, who sources describe as possibly have a mental illness."
19AX2KP,2015-03-30 00:00:00,"Aaron Hernandez Fiancee Cites Infidelity, Says She Dumped Box Prosecutors Believe May Have Held Murder Weapon - ABC News",http://abcnews.go.com/US/aaron-hernandez-trial-fiancee-describes-removing-box-home/story?id=30003781,"Aaron Hernandez's fiancee, Shayanna Jenkins, told the jury at his murder trial in Fall River, Massachusetts, today that Hernandez instructed her to remove a mystery box from their home -- a home they continued to share, she added, despite her suspicions he had been unfaithful to her.

Hernandez told her to ""go downstairs in our storage and remove a box from our home"" on the afternoon after Odin Lloyd was killed, Jenkins testified, and she described how she disposed of it, ultimately dumping it in a ""random dumpster.""

Hernandez, 25, is on trial for Lloyd's murder and has pleaded not guilty. Prosecutors believe the box may have contained the murder weapon, which has never been found, or other evidence.

Jenkins, 25, cried on the stand during talk of Hernandez's possible infidelity. She said she saw suspicious phone messages and stayed at a location away from their home for a few weeks. Ultimately, she added, the couple decided to work through their problems and continue the relationship. Jenkins said her definition of infidelity includes sexual intercourse, and she wasn't sure that happened.

Hernandez, a former New England Patriots football player, is accused of orchestrating Lloyd's slaying June 17, 2013. Prosecutors say Hernandez and two other men picked up Lloyd from his house and brought him to an industrial park near the Patriots' Gillette Stadium.

Surveillance video played for the jury today showed Jenkins going into the basement. Video previously played for the jury showed Jenkins removing a garbage bag from their home with what appeared to be a box inside.

""Did he indicate what was in the box?"" prosecutor Patrick Bomberg asked Jenkins today.

""No,"" she answered. She added, ""His tone, I believe, was normal,"" but she recalled him saying moving the box was ""important.""

Jenkins said the box was not sealed, and contained smaller boxes with cardboard on top of them. She said she put the box ""in a trash bag"" with her baby daughter's clothing ""so nothing was exposed.""

""I wasn't necessarily hiding it,"" she said. ""It was just natural instinct.""

Jenkins said Hernandez did not talk about the contents of the box and she did not ask.

Later, under cross-examination by Hernandez's lawyer, Jenkins said the box had a ""skunky smell,"" and she suspected it might contain marijuana.

Jenkins estimated that the bag with the box in it weighed about 35 or 40 pounds. Surveillance video played in court showed Jenkins putting the bag in the trunk of a car and driving away. She testified she disposed of the box in a trash bin, but doesn't recall where.

""I found a random dumpster,"" she said.

She added she was nervous about ""everything going on.""

Jenkins has pleaded not guilty to a perjury charge for earlier testimony to a grand jury in the case, according to The Associated Press. In contrast to her testimony today, the AP reported, Jenkins said during her grand jury testimony that nobody told her to remove the box.

Jenkins was granted immunity in February.

Jenkins and Hernandez were high school sweethearts and have a 2-year-old daughter together.

19B1B87,2015-03-30 00:00:00,"With Final Intense Testimony, Prosecution Rests in Boston Marathon Bombing Trial - ABC News",http://abcnews.go.com/US/final-intense-testimony-prosecution-rests-boston-marathon-bombing/story?id=30010253,"The government today rested its case against accused Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev after teary-eyed jurors heard grueling, heartbreaking testimony about the bombing's youngest victim, 8-year-old Martin Richard.

Richard was 4 ft. 5 in. tall and just under 70 lbs. when he was killed in the Boston Marathon attacks on April 15, 2013, Chief Medical Examiner Henry Nields testified. The entire length of his small body was blasted with small nails, tiny pieces of black plastic, round metal pellets, small fragments of wood, segments of black plastic, and metal pieces of the bomb allegedly detonated by Dzhokhar Tsarnaev in front of the Forum restaurant, Nields said.

Along with the clothing held up in court was a belt, which had been used as a tourniquet around Richard’s left arm, and his Nike sneakers.

Richard’s small intestine was eviscerated, part of his liver and pancreas were cut off. He suffered a ""near complete transection of the abdominal aorta,” Nields testified. In addition, “he had shredding on his left adrenal gland.” He had third degree burns on his body, which was ruined with debris packed into the pressure cooker bomb.

Six small nails were pulled from his body. Jurors saw a photo of those terrorist tools, along with evidence of the cloth, Styrofoam, plastic and other items removed during the autopsy.

Was the child’s death painful? “Yes,” Dr. Nields testified.

If any juror tried to block out what they were listening to, it became impossible when they were forced to look at the autopsy photos. At least six female jurors cried during the testimony and two male jurors had shocked looks on their face. Other jurors simply glanced down at their monitors where the images were published then quickly looked away.

Dzhokhar Tsarnaev rested his face on his left fist looked down for most of the testimony.

On the other side of court Bill Richard, Martin's father sat holding his wife with his eyes closed.

In a still image from just before the blasts, Richard is seen standing on a metal barrier watching the race. Prosecutors say Dzhokhar Tsarnaev can be seen in the same image, just feet away, dropping a backpack containing the explosives.

Earlier in the trial Bill Richard took the stand and described what he saw after the blasts.

“I saw a little boy who had his body severely damaged by an explosion,” Bill Richard told the jury flatly. “I just knew from what I saw there was no chance.”

In addition to Richard, two other people – 29-year-old Krystle Campbell and 23-year-old Lingzi Lu – were killed in the attack and some 260 others injured.

Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has pleaded not guilty to 30 counts related to the bombing. His defense has admitted to his role in it, however, and has argued he only took part because he was under the influence of his older brother and alleged co-conspirator Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who was killed in a police shootout three days after the blasts."
19BFNJx,2015-03-30 00:00:00,"Weeks After Missouri State Auditor Committed Suicide, Spokesman Also Found Dead - ABC News",http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/weeks-missouri-state-auditor-committed-suicide-spokesman-found/story?id=30013085,"Just over a month ago, Missouri state auditor Tom Schweich committed suicide in what has been described at least partially as a result of an alleged whisper smear campaign. Now, Schweich’s spokesperson has been found dead, also apparently caused by a self-inflicted gunshot wound, authorities said.

Jefferson City police spokesman Capt. Doug Shoemaker told reporters today the ""initial investigation"" into the death of Robert ""Spence"" Jackson ""gives detectives the reason to believe this is most likely a suicide.”

In the days after Schweich’s death, Jackson was vocally critical of Missouri GOP Chairman John Hancock.

Schweich, also a Republican, believed Hancock was at the helm of a whisper campaign ahead of Schweich's gubernatorial run spreading an incorrect rumor that he was Jewish. Jackson, 44, was vocal after Schweich’s death that Hancock was at the center of the anti-Semitic attack, but Hancock has denied the allegations.

A .357 magnum with one spent round was found in the “general vicinity” of Jackson’s body. Police would not confirm whether Jackson owned the gun, but they believe Jackson killed himself sometime in the early part of the weekend, either Friday or Saturday. After repeated attempts at making contact with her son, Jackson’s mother reached out to police and they found Jackson’s body in his Jefferson City apartment on Sunday night.

Shoemaker did confirm a note was found, but would not comment on its contents whatsoever and would not say whether it would ever be made public. Jackson’s body was found in his bedroom and there was “no sign of a struggle,” according to Shoemaker.

When asked if there were others in the apartment at some point, he would only say that is part of their “open investigation.”

There were no reports of sounds of a gun shot over the weekend, police said, adding Jackson’s last contact with anyone was on Friday.

Police said they “fully understand” the political issues surrounding the case and they “understand” Jackson worked for Schweich, but “it doesn’t mean we do anything more or less then for anybody else. We try to treat everyone the same…if there are more complexities in this case due to the nature of it, we will certainly investigate it.”

The police did acknowledge the higher profile nature of the case saying, ""What we’re going to uncover, I don’t know. ... We want to make sure we have some level of closure for the family.”

They are doing an autopsy and expect initial results possibly as soon as today, but toxicology results will not be ready for weeks, authorities said.

Police would not answer any detailed questions citing respect to Jackson’s family, as well as the “open investigation,” but they will “back track” the last days of Jackson’s life to try and get more information for as long as they need in order to “find some definitive information.”

Jackson was previously the spokesman for former Gov. Matt Blunt, also a Republican. He put out a statement calling Jackson a “gifted communicator.”"

Lawyers for both parties said they hope to have the matter resolved by June 1, the date set for the next hearing.

""This is very, very typical,"" said James Wagstaffe, an attorney for Susan Williams. ""The court recognized that this is an amicable matter. ... His wife and her two sons with whom he lived for many years can stay in the home and not have the home stripped of normal things that are in a home, like art and furniture, and she can keep her wedding presents.""

Susan Williams, the late comedian's third wife, filed paperwork this past December to determine who had rights to his things. She asked the court to exclude the contents of their San Francisco area home from what his three children from previous marriages were allowed to have.

Susan Williams said her husband's trust intended to distribute items from his other home in Napa, Calif., as opposed to the one they shared, according to the court documents.

The late movie star's adult children, Zachary, Zelda and Cody, claim that Susan Williams is robbing them of their father's things, including jewelry and memorabilia that he reportedly left them in his will, according to the Associated Press.

""My brothers and I have not at any point since dad’s death been invited to or visited his and Susan’s house in Tiburon, nor have we removed anything from it,"" Zelda Williams wrote today in a Tumblr post.

""They are disturbed that this petition has been filed and we are here because as an intensely private person, Mr. Williams wouldn't have wanted this,"" attorney Andrew Bassak, who represents the trustees, said today. ""That is troubling to the trustees as close confidants of Mr. Williams.""

""It's painful,"" said Meredith Bushnell, another lawyer representing the children. ""They were very close with their father.""

Williams was 63 when he died at his home last August, later deemed by authorities to be a suicide. Shortly thereafter, Susan Williams revealed that the late actor had struggled with depression and had been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease shortly before his death."

The former rapper, whose real name is Robert Van Winkle, was booked into the Palm Beach County Jail, and charged with burglary residence and grand theft, according to a Chief Sean Scheller at the Lantana Police Department. He was released from jail tonight.

Van Winkle spoke to West Palm Beach, Florida, ABC affiliate WPBF. ""It's just out of proportion I wish you guys would focus on the good things I've done,"" he told the station. Asked if the incident is part of his reality show, he laughed and said, ""I wish it was--there's nothing fun about this. I wish everyone the best and maybe the good news will travel this fast.""

In December, the police investigated a burglary at a home near a residence Van Winkle has been renovating. According to authorities, the missing items -- which included furniture, a pool heater, bicycles and other items -- were found at Van Winkle's property and later returned to the owner.

Scheller told ABC News that Van Winkle was cooperating with investigators.

A rep for Van Winkle did not respond to a request for comment.

Van Winkle, who is perhaps best known for his hit song, ""Ice Ice Baby,"" has a home renovation show on the DIY Network, ""The Vanilla Ice Project.

It was unclear whether this property is affiliated with the show."

The University of California-Berkeley student, Eloi Vasquez, 19, was visiting friends at the University of Southern California when he was last heard from early Saturday morning.

""Earlier today the Los Angeles Police Department’s Missing Persons Unit learned that the California Highway Patrol conducted an investigation of a tragic traffic collision that took place on the Eastbound 10 Freeway on Saturday, March 28th around 2:25 a.m. During the investigation, the Los Angeles County Coroner’s Office confirmed that the pedestrian struck on the freeway was unfortunately our Missing Person, Mr. Eloi Vasquez,"" LAPD said in a statement.

Vasquez, who played on his school's soccer team, went to a party at the Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity with friends but told them that he wanted to go for a walk at around 1:30 a.m., ABC station KABC reports.

According to KABC, he was last heard from less than an hour later, when he reportedly called a friend saying that he was at the beach and having trouble.

""He is a star athlete, a responsible student, and we are a tight-knit family,"" his mother Wendy Margolin earlier told ABC News. ""This is not normal behavior.""

When he left the party, he did not have money or identification, the Associated Press reported.

Friends tried to call him later Saturday morning and his phone was either dead or had been turned off.

The family doubled their reward offering to $100,000 today in hopes that it would lead to his discovery.

""Eloi is a wonderful young man who has excelled both academically and athletically here at Cal,"" the UC-Berkeley athletics department said in a statement released Sunday. ""Our entire Cal Athletics family is very concerned for Eloi’s safety and our first priority is to help in any way we can to locate him."""
19CfS4o,2015-04-07 00:00:00,'Going Clear' on Scientology: Inside the Mysterious Church Popular in Hollywood - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/clear-scientology-inside-mysterious-church-popular-hollywood/story?id=29990863,"While it boasts of membership from Hollywood’s A-list, including Tom Cruise and John Travolta, the inner-workings of the Church of Scientology remain largely a mystery to onlookers. But a new HBO documentary claims to expose the church's secrets through accounts of former members.

Much like the faith it seeks to demystify, “Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief” has spurred a wave of controversy in the wake of its explosive allegations about life inside the church, its practices, and its deceased founder: Science-fiction author L. Ron Hubbard.

Author and journalist Lawrence Wright, who wrote the book upon which the film is based, sat down with “Power Players” at the Four Seasons Hotel in Washington, D.C., for a discussion on the belief system and founding origin of Scientology.

“The idea is that it's a step-by-step ladder to spiritual enlightenment, and if you follow the techniques ... you will purge your mind of fears and neuroses,” Wright explained. “Then, you'll be enlisted in this cause, which is to clear the planet, to save the planet and keep it from destroying itself.”

In the film, former members of the church explain how the introductory principles of the techniques initially drew them to the religion. But in progressing up the “ladder to spiritual enlightenment,” one former member -- Academy Award-winning film director Paul Haggis, who spent 35 years in the faith -- recalls being presented with a head-scratching theory about the origin of the Earth.

“They gave him a locked briefcase, which he lashed to his wrist, and went into a room that was locked. And then he opened up the briefcase, and inside -- in Hubbard's handwritten script -- is the story of the origin of the universe, which is the Xenu story of a galaxy far, far away, back in time,” Wright said.

“People were shipped on airplanes ... dropped in volcanoes and blown up with hydrogen bombs.”

It was a turning point for Haggis. “Paul read it, and thought, ‘What?’” Wright recalled. “It occurred to him that this is an insanity test, and, ‘If I say I believe it, they'll think I'm insane and kick me out,’ but it turned out that that wasn't true.”

Upon Hubbard’s death in 1986, Wright explained that one of his leading disciples, David Miscavige, “wrestled control of the church.” His leadership has been controversial, with some former church leaders claiming he slapped or punched them. A number of those alleged episodes are described in Wright’s book and in the HBO documentary.

Nevertheless, the church continues to be held in esteem by many prominent Hollywood actors. And it’s in part because of the star power of Travolta, Cruise and others, that Wright believes the church has been able to maintain an air of legitimacy.

“L. Ron Hubbard understood that America really does worship ... celebrity. The idea that famous people are associated with this church adds credibility to it. And it makes people think that Scientology must be responsible for their success,” explained Wright.

In response, the church has produced a series of online videos disputing many of the claims in the book ""Going Clear"" and in the movie.

In a statement to ABC News, the church said the book is ""grossly inaccurate"" and the movie is ""bigoted propaganda."" The allegations that Miscavige struck people are ""false,"" the church said, and come from a small group of dishonest former members who were ejected from the church for misconduct.

The statement goes on to say that allegations that L. Ron Hubbard inflated his injuries in World War II are ""false"" and Wright's characterizations about Scientology are ""inaccurate.""

An encore presentation of “Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief” airs Monday, March 30, at 9 p.m. on HBO.

Mike Pence and wouldn't be willing to cater a gay wedding.

Meanwhile, the local police department said it completed an investigation into a threat on Twitter to ""burn down"" the restaurant.

The owners of Memories Pizza in Walkerton, Indiana, near the border with Michigan, told ABC News' South Bend, Indiana, affiliate WBND that they don't support gay marriage because of their religious beliefs, adding that they would be willing to serve gay or lesbian customers who come to their restaurant, just not a wedding.

""The Walkerton Police Department is committed to extending professional police services to all in need, regardless of said person’s sexual, religious, or political views,"" assistant chief of police Charles Kulp said in a statement. ""We encourage all to follow Indiana Laws and Statutes. We ask that all frustrations and rebuttals with Memories Pizza’s recent media statements remain within the law.""

Kulp said the department completed an investigation into a comment on Twitter that stated, “Who’s going to Walkerton with me to burn down Memories Pizza."" That Twitter account no longer exists.

""The Walkerton Police Department has finished an investigation into this statement and submitted a case to the St. Joseph County Prosecutors office for possible charging of harassment, intimidation, and threats,"" Kulp wrote in his statement.

“If a gay couple was to come in -- like say, they wanted us to provide them pizzas for a wedding, we would have to say 'no,'” Crystal O'Connor of Memories Pizza told WBND, calling the business a ""Christian establishment.""

“We're not discriminating against anyone,” O'Connor told WBND. ""It's just that's our belief, and everybody has the right to believe anything.

“We definitely agree with the bill,” O'Connor told WBND, referring to a state measure that prohibits state and local government from ""substantially"" burdening someone's religious beliefs without a ""compelling"" interest.

Today, Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson said he wants his state's legislature to alter a religious-freedom bill in that state that is similar to the one signed into law by Indiana Gov. Pence just last week, saying, ""We want to be known as a state that does not discriminate but understands tolerance."" Pence has said his state also hopes find a way to clarify that its law does not encourage discrimination.

Of the Indiana law, O'Connor said, ""I don't think it is targeting gays. I don't think it's discrimination. ... It's supposed to help people that have a religious belief.""

“That's a lifestyle that you choose,"" Kevin O'Connor, Crystal's father, told WBND. ""I choose to be heterosexual. They choose to be homosexual. Why should I be beat over the head because they choose that lifestyle?”"

NASA showed off its Low-Density Supersonic Decelerator today during a live broadcast from its Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. Weighing in at 7,000 pounds and measuring 15 feet wide, the spacecraft underwent a spin test on a table to show off its capability.

Spinning an object keeps it pointed in one direction, and the saucer is equipped with a rocket to slow it down.

The technology could be crucial for Mars exploration since it will decelerate heavy landers traveling at supersonic speeds through Mars' thin atmosphere. The drag device could one day help humans, their cargo and their return rockets safely reach the Red Planet.

After today's test, the next step for the vehicle will be in June when it will blast off on a test into near-space from the Navy's Pacific Missile Range Facility in Kauai, Hawaii, NASA officials said.

Testing the vehicle in the thin air of Earth's stratosphere this summer is the nearest ""local"" test to see how the flying saucer fares in Martian-like conditions."

Mike Pence’s promise to ""fix"" the law before the Final Four begins on Saturday, according to local activists.

Olympic diving legend Greg Louganis and former NBA player Jason Collins are among those coming to the state this week for press conferences or other public events. The effort to keep attention on the law around the college basketball showcase in Indianapolis caps a week where sports figures, including the president of the NCAA, have helped drive the national debate over a law gay-rights group view as opening the door to legalized discrimination.

""It should be totally repealed,"" Louganis, now an activist for LGBT causes, said on the ESPN/ABC podcast ""Capital Games."" ""Everybody should feel embraced. And I feel that the majority of the populace of Indiana do embrace all people. I felt very embraced. ... They've been so wonderful. This is just so contrary to my feelings of Indiana people.""

In a press conference on Tuesday, Pence said the law was not meant to give anyone a right to discriminate against members of the LGBT community. He called for follow-up legislation that would clarify the measure, rather than the full repeal of the initial law Indiana Democrats and critics have demanded.

Rick Sutton, a veteran LGBT organizer and activist based in Indiana, said those who are upset by the new law plan to use the visibility surrounding the Final Four to continue to make their point.

""The drumbeat won't stop. Every day, companies, universities [and] professional and amateur athletes of all kinds are stepping forward to say that this kind of discrimination is wrong -- implied or actual."" Sutton said. ""We're going to keep the drumbeat up until the state fixes this. The governor and the legislator have got to fix this completely, and thoroughly and now.""

The podcast also features an interview with NCAA president Mark Emmert, who expressed concern about the law’s impact on his Indianapolis-based organization.

""I'm anxiously awaiting whatever clarification that the legislature can bring forward to this bill so we can really know what it means and what it doesn't mean,"" Emmert told ESPN's Andy Katz. ""As it becomes better understood, we're going to have to sit down and make judgments about whether or not it changes the environment for us doing our work and for us holding events.""

Anthony Stokes, 17, was driving a car that matched the description of a car used to flee a home burglary, in which a masked person allegedly shot a gun at an 81-year-old woman who was home watching television, Roswell Police spokeswoman Officer Lisa Holland told ABC News.

When officers tried to pull the vehicle over, the driver allegedly refused to stop, and they chased him, she said.

""The car lost control at an intersection, ran over a curb, hit a pedestrian and ran into big, metal pole,"" Holland said.

Stokes died Tuesday night from injuries sustained in the crash.

Stokes had an enlarged heart in 2013 and was given six months to live without a heart transplant. At the time, doctors said they wouldn't give him a transplant because of ""noncompliance,"" which means they didn't think he could be trusted to follow medical directions.

His mother, Melencia Hamilton, told ABC News at the time that she thought doctors made their decision to deny Anthony because he had low grades and trouble with the law.

""He was just fighting,"" Hamilton said. ""Trying to take up, just trying to take up for his brother because somebody was bullying his brother.""

The hospital then reversed its decision, and Stokes underwent the transplant in August 2013.

NYU Langone bioethicist Art Caplan said Stokes's case was a difficult one to begin with, but Tuesday's events don't change anything.

""The bottom line is I don't really think today's sad events mean two years ago we shouldn't have given him a chance,"" Caplan said. ""We didn't know what would happen to him.""

He said even prisoners are sometimes given organ transplants, and teens, who are often not good at complying with medical directions, get organ transplants all the time.

""You almost always have to live with some people who are going to get into things post-transplant that we might not like,"" he said. ""That's just humanity."""

Mitchell regained consciousness during the ambulance ride to the hospital, and despite being in intensive care is ""awake and in good spirits,"" the website reported.

Joni has been hospitalized. We are awaiting official word on her condition and will post it here as soon as we know.

Joni is currently in intensive care in an LA area hospital but is awake and in good spirits. More updates to come as we hear them.

News of Mitchell’s hospitalization was first reported by TMZ.

Mitchell, 71, was born in Canada and emerged as a popular folk musician in the United States during the 1960s, establishing herself in the southern California music scene.

She is best known for her hit “Big Yellow Taxi.” Mitchell’s songwriting credits also include “Chelsea Morning,” “Both Sides Now” -- which became a huge hit for Judy Collins -- and “Woodstock,” which was recorded by Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young.

Mitchell was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997, and she has won eight Grammy Awards during her career."

Erich Nowsch Jr., 19, was arrested Thursday on suspicion of murder in the death of Tammy Meyers. The suspect, who lived one block away from the Meyers family, was arrested after a two-hour standoff.

He has been charged with murder, attempted murder and illegal discharge of a gun, and is scheduled to make his first court appearance Monday, as his arrest raises new questions into the case.

While the shooting was initially described as a random road rage incident, Meyers knew Nowsch and, according to her husband, Bob Meyers, she even consoled him in the past.

“She was really good to him. She fed him, she gave him money,” Bob Meyers said after Thursday’s arrest.

Police said they only learned of the Meyers’ personal connection to Nowsch hours before the standoff, a connection that Bob Meyers discussed after Nowsch was arrested.

“We know this boy. I couldn’t tell you this before. He knew where I lived,” Bob Meyers told reporters outside his house Thursday. “We knew how bad he was, but we didn’t know he was this bad, that he’s gotten to this point.”

Nowsch’s arrest marks the latest twist in the case. Initially, police said Meyers, a nurse, was shot as a result of random road rage after giving her teenage daughter driving lessons. Later, authorities revealed, she went home after the encounter, rounding up her eldest son, Brandon, who grabbed a gun, and then searched for the driver. That’s when the suspect allegedly followed them home and shot Meyers in her driveway, police say.

She died Saturday at the University Medical Center of Southern Nevada.

Police said Nowsch was believed to be the only shooting suspect in the case, but police were still seeking another person involved. It is unclear whether Nowsch has a lawyer.

Police charged Jamyra Gallmon, 21, with first-degree felony murder while armed in connection with the death of David Messerschmitt. His body was found inside a room at the Donovan Hotel on Feb. 10.

Messerschmitt, 30, had sent a text message to his wife the day before his body was discovered, saying he'd be home in an hour, said police. But when the newlywed didn't return to his home in Capitol Hill, his wife, Kim Vuong, filed a missing persons report.

Police didn't say what evidence led investigators to charge Gallmon but said they believe she was pictured in a surveillance video released by police.

The suspect is expected to make an appearance in court on Thursday.

Last week, Vuong asked for help finding her husband's alleged killer, saying she had lost her ""husband and best friend.""

""In one day, I lost the most important person in my life and the man I loved so much,"" she said."

A joint statement of progress is expected later today.

British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, speaking to reporters, said “a broad framework of understanding” exists, but that some issues still need to be worked out. Germany’s foreign office shared similar sentiments, writing in a statement, “Progress is visible. Nothing is agreed but if there is good will on all sides an agreement is possible.""

A deadline for the agreement had been set for March 31. While the deadline has passed, Iran’s foreign minister, speaking Tuesday, said the negotiations have been productive.

""We've accomplished quite a bit, but people needed to get some rest and start over early in the morning,"" Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said. ""And I hope we can finalize the work on Wednesday -- and hopefully begin the process of drafting.""

The State Department had said earlier Tuesday that despite progress, obstacles still remain.

""We've made enough progress in the last days to merit staying until Wednesday,"" State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said in a statement to reporters in Lausanne, Switzerland, where the talks are being held. ""There are several difficult issues still remaining.""

Sticking points during these talks included disagreements on how many centrifuges -- which are used to enrich nuclear fuel -- might remain online at Iran's deep-buried Fordo nuclear reactor, whether or not Iran will be allowed to continue nuclear research and development for scientific purposes, and what to do with the stockpile of enriched uranium it already owns.

Negotiators on all sides have been working towards this deadline since November 2013. That's when Iran and the so-called P5 +1 (U.S., U.K., France, Russia and China, plus Germany) agreed on a Joint Plan of Action (JPA), an interim agreement that paved the way for talks by temporarily halting Iran's nuclear enrichment program and subjecting it to daily inspections in exchange for the loosening of some economic sanctions.

""If we are making progress toward the finish line, then we should keep going,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Tuesday, but he added that if talks fail, then the U.S. would be forced to ""consider some other alternatives.”"

The universe is believed to be 13.8 billion years old and is home to an estimated 100 billion galaxies comprised of stars, gas and dust. However, researchers are unsure how those giant clusters came to be.

In order to capture light from the early universe, the European Space Agency's Planck telescope used cosmic microwave background signals to create a map of the radiation left by the Big Bang.

The Herschel telescope was then used to zoom in on some of the clusters that were captured by the Planck telescope, allowing researchers to examine what are believed to be precursors to galaxies.

The oval projection in the above photo is the entire sky, while the emission from Earth's home galaxy, the Milky Way, is shown as the band stretching across the center. The black dots are believed to be newly discovered clusters.

""Finding so many intensely star-forming, dust galaxies in such concentrated groups was a huge surprise,"" Hervé Dole, lead author of the study that will be published in the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics on Tuesday said, according to NASA. ""We think this is a missing piece of cosmological structure formation.""

While stars and galaxies were abundant in the early universe, they would collapse under the weight of gravity and trigger the creation of new stars and galaxies, according to NASA.

The findings show that the galaxies from the early universe have been able to create stars from gas and dust at a rate of as many 1,500 solar masses per year. The Milky Way today averages about one solar mass per year, according to the European Space Agency, meaning that about one star with the weight of our sun is created from dust and gas every year.

Astrophysicists haven't yet determined the age of the distant clusters. However, they believe they are likely the closest evidence that has been found to the enormous galaxies seen today closer to our own."

Three years ago, the now 22-year-old was presented with what he said, was an amazing opportunity to help save a life.

""It started back when I was a freshman,"" said Kinsley, who attends Furman University in South Carolina. ""My assistant coach had a relative who needed a bone marrow transplant, so I signed up.""

Kinsley, who registered at 18 years old, told ABC News that he signed up with the national marrow donor program, Be The Match.

He was eventually notified that he was not a match for his coach's family member.

""I didn’t even think about it after a while,"" he said. ""They'd send me mail to remind me that I signed up, but it wasn't really on my mind.""

In mid-February, Kinsley received a phone call that he said completely shocked him.

""It came up three years later saying I was a potential match and asked if I was willing to donate to this lady,"" he said. ""I never thought twice about being able to give.""

After an additional look into his health background, it was determined that Kinsley was a perfect match for the person in need of a bone marrow transplant.

The donation was set for March 30.

""On average, 1 in 540 U.S. Be The Match Registry members go on to donate to a patient,"" a Be The Match spokesperson told ABC News. ""Most donors typically back to their normal routine in a few days. The donor's marrow naturally replaces itself in four to six weeks.""

Kinsley went in for the four-hour procedure on Monday.

Since he's now weakened by the process, doctors told him that he should sit out as catcher for his next few baseball games.

""Last night I missed the game against Clemson and will probably miss another four games,"" Kinsley said. ""Being able to give up some of my senior year of baseball is nothing compared to being about to help someone out.""

Due to patient confidentiality, it is unclear who received Kinsley's bone marrow donation.

Be The Match confirmed that if both parties are in the U.S. and consent after one year, then they are able to exchange contact information.

""I guess it's to allow her to heal in privacy,"" Kinsley said. ""But I’m definitely going to try and take advantage of that and see the impact it made when I'm allowed to.

""I'd also like to say that I feel there's a lot of misconception donating for bone marrow and that’s why I think there's so few matches out there. I think people are scared and that it's painful.

Pemex, a Mexican state-run oil company, said 300 workers have been evacuated after the fire broke out on their Abkatun Permanente platform.

Pemex said in a statement tonight that no spill occurred. ""The fire that broke today at the Abkatun processing platform in Campeche did not cause an oil spill in the sea. Authorities only registered a runoff, which is being contained by specialised vessels,"" Pemex said.

Among those killed was a contractor for the Mexican oil services company, Cotemar, according to Pemex. Employees who escaped told the Associated Press some people were forced to jump into the shallow waters to escape the blaze.

""There was nothing you could do but run,"" Roger Arias Sanchez, an employee of Pemex contractor Cotemar told the AP.

Currently, there are eight fireboats fighting the blaze, according to Pemex. Fleets of helicopters ferried workers from the oil rig to the town of Ciudad del Carmen, according to the AP.

It is unclear how much fuel might have leaked into the Gulf of Mexico as a result of the incident.

The Pemex company has dealt with multiple deadly accidents in recent years, including a 2013 blast at the company headquarters that killed 37 people.

In 2012, a fire at a natural gas facility killed 26."

Alaska Airlines Flight 567, bound for Portland, Oregon, was taxi-ing for takeoff Saturday night when the woman was stung on the hand, Alaska Airlines spokesman Cole Cosgrove told ABC News today.

""We don't know exactly how the scorpion made it on the plane,"" Cosgrove said, but added that the flight originated in Los Cabos, Mexico.

The plane then went back to the gate, where the woman was checked by medics and released, Cosgrove said.

""When the flight was at the gate as medics were checking out the customer, some maintenance employees came on the plane to do a look through the cabin to make sure there were no other scorpions,"" Cosgrove said.

According to Cosgrove, flight attendants killed the scorpion, but he said he didn't know how.

The plane took off for Portland after about a 50-minute delay, though the stung woman did not get back on the flight.

""I don't know what our customer service folks will do, but I'll imagine we'll reach out to the customer and do our best to take care of her,"" Cosgrove said.

After the flight arrived in Portland, an exterminator ""checked through the plane thoroughly,"" he said."

But even if they don’t, there’s a good chance you’re already eating GMOs, Gregory Jaffe, the director of biotechnology for Center for Science in the Public Interest, told ABC News. Eight different types of GMO crops are already in use in the U.S., Jaffe said: Corn, soy beans, cotton, canola, sugar beets, alfalfa, squash and papaya.

“The majority of those crops are now GMO,” Jaffe noted.

Two other GMO crops -- apples and potatoes -- have also been approved for sale but are not yet commercially available. And several other types of produce are now winding their way through testing with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the U.S. Department of Agriculture or some other governmental agency, Jaffe said.

For example, a new pink pineapple variety being developed in Costa Rica by Del Monte Fresh Produce, contains an over-expressed a gene from a pineapple and a tangerine. Some of its other genes have been silenced and its flowering process has been altered. All this genetic fiddling has produced a fruit with rose-colored flesh that is high in the cancer-fighting chemical lycopene.

Humans have been genetically modifying their food for centuries through techniques like hybridization and selective breeding, Pamela Ronald, a plant scientist with the University of California, Davis, pointed out.

“Modern genetic alteration is different in that it splices genes from another species into another to produce some beneficial trait,” she said.

But the benefits of this DNA manipulation can sometimes be offset by unforeseen negatives, Jaffe said. In some cases they might accidentally introduce an allergen or they might harm the environment, he said.

While he believes all GMO-containing food currently on the market is safe to eat, Jaffe said CSPI is calling for mandatory FDA approval before allowing a crop to be sold to the public.

Testing for GMO products is currently voluntary, according to an FDA spokeswoman.

“Although the consultation process is voluntary, compliance with the law is mandatory; it is the manufacturer's responsibility to ensure that the food products it offers for sale are safe and otherwise comply with applicable requirements,” the spokeswoman said in a statement to ABC News.

GMO plants should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, Ronald said.

“With any kind of breeding, there is a possibility of unintended consequences,” she said. “That is always a risk that scares people but it has to be put in perspective -- the risk is no different than for other type of crop.”

If approved, the Del Monte Fresh pineapple could be sold but not grown in the U.S. The company has said the fruit is produced in a way that prevents seed production or pollination, reducing the chances it could cause harm to the environment."

Dakota Meyer are engaged, a Palin family friend confirmed.

The daughter of former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin posted a photo with her new fiance on Instagram, writing ""Truly the luckiest girl in the world, cannot wait to marry this man!!!!""

Bristol, who was previously engaged to Levi Johnston--the father of her 6-year-old son Tripp--also posted a close-up shot of her new ring:

Meyer served as a Marine in Iraq and Afghanistan. In 2011, he was awarded the Medal of Honor, becoming the third living Medal of Honor recipient since the Vietnam War.

Meyer wrote on Facebook today, ""Coming back from Afghanistan there were days I thought I may never be happy again, and I know there's a lot of you out there who know that feeling. We only have one life to live and we have to do our best to live it the right way, and Bristol makes me a better man. I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with her and Tripp.""

Delighted mom Sarah Palin posted this on Facebook: ""Our families couldn’t be happier for Bristol and Dakota! We’re honored to welcome Dakota into our family. He’s an American hero and patriot whose service to our country – like all his fellow Medal of Honor recipients – has been above and beyond the call of duty; but even more important is he’s a good and kind man who loves Bristol and Tripp, and is loved by them. They met last year when he was in Alaska to film an episode of “Amazing America,” and even then it was noticed that just as we like to describe Bristol as “an old soul” wise beyond her years, the same also applies to Dakota.

Nearly two-thirds of adult Americans own a smartphone -- up from 35 percent in the spring of 2011, according to the study.

Perhaps even more interesting: Pew reported that 7 percent of users are smartphone dependent, meaning that their device is their primary source of Internet access and that they have little to no options for getting online elsewhere.

The economic disparity for smartphone dependent users is also apparent, with 13 percent of Americans earning less than $30,000 per year relying on their smartphones for Internet access. For those with income of more than $75,000, that shrinks to 1 percent.

Nearly half of smartphone dependent people have also had to shut down their service for a period of time due to the cost of service, while 30 percent reported they often ran out of their allotted data for the month."

The medieval hospital was excavated several years ago was part of the Victorian era building's refurbishment. While researchers knew of the site, the scope of it wasn't discovered until an excavation from 2010 to 2012.

The results of the excavation and photos were released today in the Archaeological Journal.

Researchers said the skeletons date back to somewhere between the 13th and 15th centuries and were left opposite the site of the Hospital of St. John the Evangelist, which was established in 1195 to care for the poor and the sick.

Photos from the excavation site show hundreds of nearly complete skeletons perfectly lined up in burial rows, much like modern cemeteries. Researchers said the lack of coffins and scarcity of grave goods support the theory that the cemetery was used for the poor.

No evidence of the Black Death was found in the remains, according to researchers.

Craig Cessford of the Cambridge University Department of Archaeology and Anthropology led the dig and said it was ""one of the largest medieval hospital osteoarchaeological assemblages from the British Isles.""

The bodies did not appear to exhibit any serious medical issues that could have required care. This could mean ""that the main role of the Hospital was spiritual and physical care of the poor and infirm rather than medical treatment of the sick and injured,"" the report said."

Researchers from the Fudan University in Shanghai are investigating if 3-D scans can find hidden signs of aging and potentially develop an app that will allow doctors to identify patients at high risk for deadly health complications as they grow old.

In a new study published in Cell Research Journal, the team scanned the faces of 300 people to create a “comprehensive map” of the human face while it ages. The ""map"" consisted of a series of male and female faces during five different age groups between 17 to 77.

Researchers then combed through 3-D images of participants to identify slow agers or people who look younger than their age, well-predicted agers or people who look their age, and fast agers, or people who look older than their years.

The team’s goal is to find a way for doctors to find people with “older” faces and identify if they’re also at higher risk for complications from poor health.

Researchers also looked at biomarkers connected to age in the blood including cholesterol and albumin to see if those signs corresponded with the “age” of the person’s face. Researchers found some correlation, but it did not correspond as high as other proven biomarkers that help researchers identify age.

However with more study and work, the team hopes to fine tune their algorithm so that health officials can easily find trouble signs just by looking at a person’s face.

""We will package our predictor into a downloadable app, and doctors will be able to use it provided they can upload a 3-D image of their patient into it,"" Jing-Dong Han of Shanghai Institutes of Biological Sciences told the New Scientist website.

Steve Horvath, a biostatistician and bioinformatician at University of California Los Angeles’ David Geffen School of Medicine, has done multiple studies identifying biomarkers for the aging process by looking at the DNA of blood and tissues.

“I love the idea. I think it’s very intuitive,” Horvath told ABC News of the study. “Most people are very good at judging another person’s age just by looking at their face. [This study] makes it more rigorous by using pattern recognition algorithm.”

Horvath, however, says the study is just a very early step and needs to be proven in follow-up studies. Horvath wants to see an algorithm developed that would be applicable to multiple ethnicities and not just people of Chinese descent.

“I’m interested to relate our blood-based biomarkers to their aging biomarkers,” said Horvath. “I would love to see if someone has the blood older than expected and their facial features are also older.”

Horvath said he and other researchers are hoping that by finding aging markers in blood, tissue and now face scans, doctors will be able to find patients at high risk for certain health complications and treat them proactively."

The standalone app is said to initially be available for Android devices in the United States. It will be geared toward making it easy for children to find fun and educational content in areas that interest them, along with a channel dedicated to promoting early literacy.

Among the kid-approved staples expected to be included in the app are videos from Jim Henson TV, Mother Goose Club and Thomas the Tank Engine.

It's expected the app will officially be announced on Monday at the Kidscreen Summit in Miami when YouTube executive Malik Ducard delivers what the conference is billing as a ""revealing keynote.""

When Google bought YouTube for $1.65 billion in 2006, many people wondered if the search giant had wildly overpaid for the site. Today, the website is said to be valued as high as $40 billion.

Half of all views on YouTube now come from mobile devices, making it clear that there's a real market for kids to enjoy a family-friendly version of YouTube via an app."

Anthony Stokes, 17, was driving a car that matched the description of a car used to flee a home burglary, in which a masked person allegedly shot a gun at an 81-year-old woman who was home watching television, Roswell Police spokeswoman Officer Lisa Holland told ABC News.

When officers tried to pull the vehicle over, the driver allegedly refused to stop, and they chased him, she said.

""The car lost control at an intersection, ran over a curb, hit a pedestrian and ran into big, metal pole,"" Holland said.

Stokes died Tuesday night from injuries sustained in the crash.

Stokes had an enlarged heart in 2013 and was given six months to live without a heart transplant. At the time, doctors said they wouldn't give him a transplant because of ""noncompliance,"" which means they didn't think he could be trusted to follow medical directions.

His mother, Melencia Hamilton, told ABC News at the time that she thought doctors made their decision to deny Anthony because he had low grades and trouble with the law.

""He was just fighting,"" Hamilton said. ""Trying to take up, just trying to take up for his brother because somebody was bullying his brother.""

The hospital then reversed its decision, and Stokes underwent the transplant in August 2013.

NYU Langone bioethicist Art Caplan said Stokes's case was a difficult one to begin with, but Tuesday's events don't change anything.

""The bottom line is I don't really think today's sad events mean two years ago we shouldn't have given him a chance,"" Caplan said. ""We didn't know what would happen to him.""

He said even prisoners are sometimes given organ transplants, and teens, who are often not good at complying with medical directions, get organ transplants all the time.

""You almost always have to live with some people who are going to get into things post-transplant that we might not like,"" he said. ""That's just humanity."""

The unidentified 56-year-year-old man was admitted to John L. McClellan Memorial Veterans Hospital in Little Rock last May with weakness, fatigue, body aches and an elevated serum creatinine level, which meant his kidneys weren't functioning properly, according to the doctors' letter published in the New England Journal of Medicine Thursday.

The patient's urine sample was ""remarkable"" for its abundance of calcium oxalate crystals, Dr. Fyed Syed and Dr. Alejandra Mena-Gutierrez told ABC News today. Both doctors treated the patient and co-authored the letter along with Dr. Umbar Ghaffar, who was not immediately available for comment.

Calcium oxalate crystals are molecules that can put someone at high risk to develop kidney stones, Syed and Mena-Gutierrez said.

High levels of oxalate in the body is usually due to a genetic disorder, complications from gastric surgery or consumption of antifreeze, the doctors said, but the patient's history outlined in the letter didn't match any of those explanations.

An explanation was finally found after the patient admitted to drinking 16 eight-ounce glasses of iced tea daily, Syed and Mena-Gutierrez said, adding that black tea, ""a rich source of oxalate,"" accounts for 84 percent of tea consumed in the U.S.

Drinking 16 cups of tea daily, the patient consumed more than 1,500 milligrams a day, the doctors said. The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics advises consuming no more than 40 to 50 milligrams of oxalate per day, they added.

""The case presented here was almost certainly due to excessive consumption of iced tea,"" the authors wrote.

The doctors said they've had patients who've developed kidney stones from high-oxalate foods such as spinach, chocolate and coffee, but never nephropathy, or kidney damage.

""This is the first time we've ever heard of iced tea causing kidney damage and failure,"" Syed and Mena-Gutierrez said. ""It's certainly an interesting find for us.""

However, for those paranoid about drinking tea now, the doctors said they want to emphasize that tea in moderation is OK.

""If you're having two to three cups a day, you're probably OK as long as your family doesn't have a history of kidney disease,"" Syed said. ""Just don't drink in excess or replace water with tea, like this man did.""

The patient has since been discharged, but his kidneys are still non-functioning, and he receives out-patient dialysis treatment three times a week, Syed and Mena-Gutierrez said."

The strikes come after ISIS posted a new online video purporting to show the execution of 21 Egyptian Christians.

Although Egypt is considered a member of the coalition, officials say these strikes in Libya were not in any way coordinated with coalition leadership and Operation Inherent Resolve.

""This was not a coalition strike,"" a senior defense official told ABC News. ""This was a decision made by the Egyptian government and I have seen no indication the U.S. was involved in any way.""

The U.S. is operating under strict guidelines set forth by President Obama last year that authorizes strikes against ISIS only within the boundaries of Iraq and Syria, meaning that these airstrikes targeting ISIS in Libya are the first of their kind.

Senior officials say they were also unaware of any prior warning the Egyptians may have given to the U.S. before striking ISIS targets in Libya.

According to the latest press release from the Pentagon, Egypt has yet to officially contribute to coalition airstrikes in Iraq or Syria. Countries who have include: U.S., Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Bahrain, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

U.S. officials have been unable to provide any assessment of how effective the Egyptian strikes in Libya may have been.

Senior military commanders have warned in recent months of signs that ISIS attempting to gain influence inside Libya, but at this point there is no plan to begin hitting targets there. As one official put it, "" We don’t think there is very much there.""

Yet other counterterrorism officials in Washington caution that although ISIS may not have a unified network of militants inside Libya, they do have a significant number of supporters and sympathizers in Libya, that along with other violent extremists there, pose a serious security threat inside the country."
19P86oM,2015-03-25 00:00:00,"Germanwings Crash: Audio File Recovered From Black Box, Official Says - ABC News",http://abcnews.go.com/International/americans-germanwings-plane-official/story?id=29887148,"The director of the lead investigating agency said today that they have recovered an audio file from the black box of the downed Germanwings flight but have not found the second black box from the Airbus A320 that crashed in the French Alps.

This comes after French Prime Minister Francois Hollande said at an earlier news conference when he said that crews had found the exterior of the black box but not the module that contains the memory equipment, though a the director of the Bureau d’Enquetes et d’Analyses (BEA) went on to deny any such discovery.

""We have not localized the black box,"" said BEA Director Rémi Jouty. ""We have not found any debris of the black box and in the history of air accidents we know about ... [we] don't remember any recorder broken into little pieces.""

When asked if they had ruled out the possibility of the crash being the result of a terrorist attack, he said the BEA is ""not ruling out any hypothesis at this stage.""

They have recovered an audio file from the first black box, the cockpit voice recorder, though no further details were revealed about whether or not voices are heard on the recording.

Jouty noted that it would take days for initial findings to be released, though it will be weeks before a full understanding is clear, but he was able to weigh in and tentatively ruled several possible causes out based on the debris pattern.

""The area seems very big but the debris seems very small which is not at all consistent with an aircraft that exploded mid-air,"" Jouty said.

""At the moment, there's no information leading us to think that the weather conditions were particularly bad,"" he said.

Jouty said that the flight path looks consistent with one controlled by a pilot, but that may also be attributable to the plane's automatic pilot settings, saying that it was ""too soon to draw any conclusions.""

One of the problems facing investigators is the location of the crash site, as the area is very steep and unstable. Investigators and site crews have to be tied to one another when they are near the crash site to ensure their safety, Jouty said.

""After 20 years in this industry and being a Lufthansa pilot myself, we still can't understand waht happened here yesterday,"" Germanwings CEO Carsten Spohr said at a press conference in Barcelona this evening.

""We have an aircraft in perfect technical condition with two experienced pilots which was involved in such a terrible accident,"" Spohr said.

Earlier today, Germanwings CEO Thomas Winkelmann noted that two Americans were on board the Germanwings flight that crashed. The U.S. State Department has since confirmed that there were three Americans on board.

Two of the Americans were later identified as Yvonne Selke, and employee of Booz Allen, and Selke's daughter, Emily, according to Betty Thompson, the company's chief personnel officer.

The Germanwings plane crashed Tuesday in the Alps in southern France with 150 people on board, including two babies, the airline said. French President Francois Hollande said there were ""apparently no survivors.""

Searchers returned to the crash scene today, as France's minister of the interior said a black box voice recorder from the plane is damaged. Even so, said the official, Bernard Cazeneuve, the information on the recorder should be retrievable.

The CEO of Lufthansa, which owns Germanwings, said a full analysis of the voice recorder was expected to be done by Thursday. But Brice Robin, public prosecutor of Marseille, said on BFM TV that black box results could take several days.

The initial focus for the voice recorder investigators will be ""on the human voices, the conversations,"" followed by the cockpit sounds, France's transport minister, Alain Vidalies, told Europe 1 radio this morning.

Police helicopter searches of the Germanwings Airbus crash site resumed Wednesday morning.

Xavier Roy, coordinator for French air rescue, told ABC News that no bodies are going to be taken from the mountain today, and that the investigation on site will take a week. Unlike other crash sites, Roy said, there isn't much to find.

""When you go to a crash site you expect to recognize parts of an airplane."" he said. ""Sadly, here you don't see anything -- just debris scattered all over.""

He added that this was a difficult area to search, as it is ""nearly impossible to reach by foot,"" making it challenging to get rescuers in and out of the area safely.

The top priorities now are locating bodies and the second black box, he said.

In addition to 72 Germans, 35 Spanish and two Americans on board, Winkelmann, the Germanwings CEO, said there were two victims each from Australia, Argentina, Iran and Venezuela. One victim each came from Britain, the Netherlands, Colombia, Mexico, Japan, Denmark, Belgium and Israel, he said, adding that the list isn't yet final because the company is still trying to contact relatives of 27 victims. Winkelmann added that in some cases victims' nationality weren’t clear because of possible dual citizenship.

A German high school has posted the names of their 16 students and two colleagues who were all on board the flight and died in the crash as they were returning from a Spanish-language exchange program.

Hollande, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy were scheduled to arrive at the crash staging area today.

The cause of the crash has not yet been determined, the Germanwings CEO said. Lufthansa called the crash ""an accident.""

""Seeing the site of the accident was harrowing,"" Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr tweeted this morning. ""We are in deep mourning. Our thoughts are with the relatives of the victims.""

Four voice mails were played for the court and, while three were perfunctory, one gave some insight into Routh's apparent state of mind leading up to the Feb. 2, 2013, shooting.

""Kind of a sad day when it rains. It's a good sad. Rain will come and rains will leave. I guess that's what they do,"" Routh was heard saying on the tape.

Jeff Shaffer, a former Secret Service agent who now specializes in cybersecurity and computer forensics, analyzed the calls and said Kyle and Routh spoke several times, with those calls lasting between two and 15 minutes each.

Kyle's call logs show that in addition to receiving two calls from his wife, Taya, he had missed calls from people close to Routh.

Routh's girlfriend, Jennifer Weed, tried to call Kyle at 1:37 p.m. and 6:14 p.m. on the day of his slaying, along with Routh's mother, who called the former Navy Seal at 6:06 p.m.

Kyle regularly worked with veterans after retiring from the military and he offered to try to help Routh, a former Marine, after Routh's mother reached out to him.

The phone records came this afternoon as part of the fourth day of the double murder trial, following the testimony of three law enforcement officials involved in the case.

The Texas jailer who transported Routh after the slaying of Kyle and Kyle's friend Chad Littlefield said the suspect was irritated during the drive.

Sgt. Kenny Phillips of the Erath County Jail testified this morning about Feb. 2, 2013, when he transferred Routh from one jail to another after he was arrested in the shooting deaths of Kyle and Kyle's friend Chad Littlefield.

Phillips said Routh, now 27, asked for a cigarette during the drive.

""I would call him under the influence maybe,"" Phillips said in Erath County court this morning, noting that Routh's attitude changed “a great deal"" during the ride.

Phillips said Routh ""was in a detox situation for a while.”

Routh's use of marijuana on the morning of the shooting had come up in the trial last week, with his uncle testifying that they smoked together before he went to the gun range with Kyle.

Today marks the fourth day of the murder trial and, like last week, the families of both Kyle and Littlefield are in the courtroom.

Routh was seen taking notes throughout this morning's testimony. He faces life in prison if he is found guilty. He has entered a not guilty plea and his defense team will be arguing that he was insane at the time of the shooting."
19pFzpj,2015-02-17 00:00:00,Inside a Northern India Temple Where Women Are Exorcized to Tame Their 'Ghosts' - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/International/inside-northern-india-temple-women-exorcized-tame-ghosts/story?id=27882522,"Screams rang out from the temple of Guru Deoji in Northern India. It was the sounds of a woman who seemed to be begging for mercy.

The woman, believed by her husband to be possessed by demons, was undergoing an exorcism. And she is far from being the only one.

Locals in Malajpur, India, where the temple is located, say thousands of women have been brought to the temple by their husbands or family members over the years to submit to a reclusive guru and his disciples who claim to drive off demons and restore sanity for a fee. Exorcisms can involve the women being shouted at, their hair pulled and even beaten. ABC News' ""Nightline"" obtained a video that captured an exorcism ritual at the temple in which women were beaten with a broom.

To get rid of ghosts, rural India has traditionally relied on gurus claiming to have supernatural powers who the husbands or family of the possessed pay in exchange to have their loved ones exorcized.

V.B. Rawat, an activist and author who has written about social development in India, said it’s all a sham.

“It is an attempt to keep people subjugated for years in the name of tradition, in the name of religion, so they do not question the wrongs done to them,” Rawat said.

Most often, he said, it’s the women who are wronged. “These kinds of things are used against women ... A woman can easily be declared as a witch.”

Rawat is a so-called “rationalist,” meaning someone who works to expose “black magic,” and it’s dangerous work in India. Last year, a rationalist named Narenda Dabholkar was shot twice in the head at close range on his morning walk by two assailants on a motorcycle, according to the Times of India. Dabholkar was mobilizing public support for a new law against superstition in the state legislature at the time.

“Nightline” set out on a journey with Rawat to Guru Deoji’s temple in Malajpur to see what was going on.

While at the temple, a woman named Krishna said she had lived there for one year because her husband believes she is possessed. He said he believes his wife’s own ghost abuses her and won’t let her have a son.

“She gets aggressive, she can’t speak,” her husband said in Hindi.

During an exorcism by the guru, Krishna’s eyes went wild, her body slacked, but it was over quickly.

When the guru finally agreed to talk to “Nightline” on the second day, he said through a translator that the “temple heals,” not him, and he is more of a caretaker who channels the powers of gurus before him. He also claimed that women he performed exorcisms on later gave birth to sons.

But on that day, a group of rationalists arrived, saying they were there to stage an intervention on the guru and expose him as a fraud. The guru refused to perform any exorcisms until the group left. Within minutes, the temple was shut down and the doors closed.

On the third day, “Nightline” was allowed back as the only outsiders in the temple. Inside, men and women separated and the chanting began as the guru’s disciples prepared the exorcism on women ready to submit.

“People who will watch her will say it is the ghost who is beaten up, not the woman. The problem is it is the woman who is beaten up,” Rawat said. “I call it a celebration of ignorance.”

One after the other, women approached and bowed down before the temple’s alter, as they were shouted at and had their hair pulled. All the while, one of the guru’s disciples demanded demons leave the women’s bodies. It was a frantic, desperate scene. But Krishna said she will keep coming back until she is certain her demon is gone."

It’s officially ""Washington's Birthday,"" but the name has evolved informally over the years to honor not just the first president, but all 43 of them.

Keeping this theme in mind, here are 12 fun facts you probably didn't know about our past commanders in chief, with some help from Steven Noll, an expert historian and senior lecturer at the University of Florida.

One Family’s Presidents Day Tradition You Have to See to Believe

Martin Van Buren, the eighth U.S. president, had an interesting nickname during his presidency, Noll says. Many referred to Van Buren as ""Old Kinderhook,"" after his house along the Hudson River in upstate New York. His supporters would shout ""OK,"" for short, in rallies, according to NPR.

Could you ever imagine a bathtub without running water? Neither can we, and apparently neither could the nation's 13th president from 1850 to 1853, Millard Fillmore.  Fillmore was the first president to have a bathtub with running water.

James Buchanan served as president from 1857 to 1861, making him the 15th president. He was the first unmarried president to be elected into office. Grover Cleveland, the nation's 22nd president, was also elected into office unmarried but, unlike Buchanan, Cleveland married while holding his position in office, according to WhiteHouseHistory.org.

Rutherford B. Hayes, the 19th president, was the first president to have a phone installed in the White House. And while this fun fact isn't about Hayes, it is about his wife, Lucy Hayes. The first lady refused to serve alcohol at the White House because she believed in the temperance movement, thus lending her the nickname, ""Lemonade Lucy.""

Benjamin Harrison, the 23rd president, was the first commander in chief to install electricity in the White House, according to WhiteHouseHistory.org. Harrison served four years in office, from 1889 to 1893, and installed electricity in 1891. Another interesting fact: Harrison was the last president to have a beard, and also the first president to have a Christmas tree in the White House.

William Taft, born in 1857, served as the nation's 27th president from 1909 to 1913. During his presidency, Taft was the first president to throw out a pitch during a baseball game. That first pitch was in the 1910 Senator's Opening Day game against the Philadelphia Athletics.

It is said that Taft is also the one who helped to coin the term ""seventh-inning stretch."" Taft got up during the seventh inning of a game to stretch his legs because he could bear sitting down no more, Professor Noll says. The crowd got up to honor their president, but when the president returned a few minutes later, the crowd followed suit, thus giving the name, the ""seventh-inning stretch.""

Today, transatlantic traveling of our president is the norm. It seems like almost every other week President Obama is in another country. But, interestingly enough, Woodrow Wilson, the 28th president from 1913 to 1921, was the first president to cross the Atlantic Ocean while in office.

The nation's 30th president, Calvin Coolidge, was commonly known as ""Silent Cal"" because he enjoyed childish practical jokes such as buzzing for his bodyguards and then hiding under his desk as they frantically searched for him,"" according to HistoryToday.com.

Ever wonder how the “Star-Spangled Banner “became our National Anthem? We have President Herbert Hoover to thank for that. Hoover, the 31st president, signed a law that made the ""Star-Spangled Banner"" our National Anthem based on an 1814 poem by Francis Scott Key, according to History.com.

Random fact: It is also said that Hoover’s son, Allan, had pet alligators that wandered around the White House, according to CNN.

Gerald Ford, our nation's 38th president, was surprisingly domestic. This down-to-earth president enjoyed cooking his own breakfast, Noll says. The Gerald Ford Foundation website also goes onto say that Ford even enjoyed making his own muffins. Who's hungry for breakfast?

Jimmy Carter, our 39th president, was the first president to be born in a hospital. Carter served in modern years, from 1977 to 1981, thus begging the question, where were the other presidents born before him?

Ronald Reagan, one of the nation's most likeable presidents, served as our 40th president from 1981 to 1989.  Reagan, born in 1911, didn't become president until 1981, 70 years later, thus making him the nation’s oldest president to have ever served."

The decision Monday by a family court judge in Delaware comes after four days of hearings in December and January that included conflicting testimony from Driscoll and Busch, a driver known as “The Outlaw.”

Driscoll stated in Kent County court that Busch grabbed her throat and slammed her head into a wall during an argument last fall. Busch has denied the assault allegations.

“This case is about domestic violence, and yes, the judge found evidence of that,” Driscoll’s attorney, Carolyn McNeice, said.

Busch also cannot buy or possess firearms under the judge’s order.

Busch’s attorney, Rusty Hardin, released a statement Monday after the ruling saying he was “deeply disappointed” and intends to appeal.

""It is important to note that the Commissioner's ruling is a civil family court matter and totally unconnected to any criminal investigation or finding. Regardless of the Commissioner's finding, we know that Kurt never committed an act of family violence,"" Hardin said in the statement.

Despite the judge’s ruling, Busch is still eligible to compete in Sunday’s Daytona 500.

During the trial, Busch, 37, alleged that Driscoll is out to ruin his career, and that she told him she’s a trained assassin. He submitted a never-aired reality show as evidence to support those allegations.

""There's a lot of sensitive things that I work on. Most of them you're never going to see,"" Driscoll said in a video clip.

Driscoll called the allegations ludicrous. She’s still pursuing criminal charges against Busch.

NASCAR, in a statement, said it will take no immediate action against Busch, but officials are waiting for more information from the court, as the written opinion and conclusions are expected in the coming days.

""NASCAR fully recognizes the serious nature of this specific situation and the broader issue of domestic violence,"" the NASCAR statement said. ""We will continue to gather information and monitor this situation very closely, and we expect our members to conduct themselves properly.""

VisitIthaca.com has decided to direct all people to its website to ""visit The Florida Keys this week.""

A pop-up photo of palm trees complete with a link to a Florida Keys tourism site reads:

""That's it. We surrender. Winter, you win. Key West anyone?

Due to this ridiculously stupid winter, Ithaca invites you to visit The Florida Keys this week. Please come back when things thaw out. Really, it's for the birds here now. (Still want to Visit Ithaca? Are you sure? Ok, click here.)

P.S. Send us a postcard.""

Visitors Bureau Director Bruce Stoff said, ""We just reached the breaking point this last weekend. The skiing is great now, the best Ithaca has had in years, but we don't blame people for dreaming of palm trees.""

When he contacted people at the Keys website to which the Ithaca site links, Stoff said, they were ""taken aback.""

""They didn't really take us seriously,"" he said.

But Stoff was quite serious and changed the Visit Ithaca site Sunday evening. And the idea to tell people to stay away from the destination has resulted in far more attention than the destination's used to getting in the winter months.

Temperatures in Ithaca this week will dip into the single digits. The Keys? Today's high is 76.

""Come see us when we thaw out,"" Stoff said."

19tXIlW,2015-02-17 00:00:00,"Despite Horror in Libya, Experts Warn Against Military Action - ABC News",http://abcnews.go.com/International/International/horror-libya-experts-warn-military-action/story?id=29022752,"As Egypt’s Coptic Christian community mourned the 21 Egyptians beheaded by the Libyan affiliates of ISIS, Egypt’s president called for a U.N. resolution mandating an international intervention in Libya -- a move experts argue may plunge Libya deeper into crisis.

""We will not allow them to cut off the heads of our children,” Egyptian President Abdel Fatah el-Sisi told France’s Europe 1 Radio today. ""There is no other choice,” he added. ""We have to work together to defeat terrorism.""

Sisi referred to the 2011 NATO campaign which launched airstrikes directed at former dictator Moamar Gadhafi’s troops and imposed a no-fly zone over parts of the country, as an “unfinished mission” that ""abandoned the Libyan people as prisoners to extremist militias.""

In the nearly four years since longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi was killed in Libya, the country has been plagued by instability giving birth to those opportunistic militant groups nationwide and two rival governments locked in an escalating -– and increasingly complicated civil war.

""The options going forward -- from a U.S. and NATO perspective -- are all bad,"" said Chris Chivvis, Associate Director, International Security and Defense Policy Center and a Senior Political Scientist at the Rand Corporation.

The U.N.-backed international intervention Sisi called for today doesn’t appear to have the support of Libya, nor its neighbors across the Mediterranean.

""This is the job of the Libyan armed forces currently, what we need now is support from other countries, including arms support,” Libyan military spokesperson Col. Ahmed Al-Mosmari told Ahram Online today, lobbying for an end to an arms embargo. Part of the internationally recognized government based out of Tobruk, Libya, Al-Mosmari stopped short of asking for foreign boots on the ground, but said all options were on the table as Libya plots its next move.

Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzo played down talk of Italian involvement in a military operation, after initially warning his European allies to “stop sleeping” as the extremists grow stronger just 500 miles south from Italy’s southern tip.

""We've been saying at every level that Libya is out of control for three years and we'll keep doing so,” Renzi told Mediaset.

Adding today, after a meeting with his top ministers: ""There was renewed Italian commitment for strong diplomatic action within the framework of the U.N. and support for an urgent initiative at the Security Council to promote stability and peace in Libya.”

Italian and European reticence to commit to any kind of international intervention is a combination of both politics and economics, explained Frederic Wehrey, Senior Associate, Middle East Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

""Libya is bad, but they also have Ukraine to worry about,” he said, questioning the details of the unlikely UN-backed force, where it would deploy and who would foot the bill.

“It is not for today to consider any contribution of the European Union to any sort of military action,"" EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Federica Mogherini made clear to reporters in Madrid. ""Daesh is a threat to the entire country, to all Libyans and that will require a joint action to face the threat in Libya,"" she added, saying she would discuss possibilities with both the United States and Egypt later this week.

But regardless of leadership, any kind of military action aimed at ISIS, Wehrey said, would likely add oil to the domestic fire already blazing –- not help extinguish it. For example, each side could use the threat to take advantage, expanding the target set to include political opponents.

Experts say the key is to establish a ceasefire and a unity government but the means to those ends remain murky as the battlefield lines continue to blur. Though cautious, Wehrey puts his money on the U.N.-brokered peace talks that kicked off in Geneva last month but success depends on keeping pragmatic players from all sides at the table.

“Ending the civil war must be first and foremost -- but the question is how do you solve the terrorism problem without stressing existing political fissures? You don’t want to empower the militias –- you don’t want to take sides because that could derail the democratic transition.”

He added, “the risk of failure [of an international military intervention] is very, very high."""
19UeKJU,2015-05-07 00:00:00,"As California's Drought Worsens, Governor Announces New Water Restrictions - ABC News",http://abcnews.go.com/US/californias-drought-worsens-governor-announces-water-restrictions/story?id=30047515,"California Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. announced a set of mandatory water conservation measures today, as the state continues to struggle with a prolonged drought that has lasted for more than four years.

""Today we are standing on dry grass where there should be five feet of snow,"" Brown said in a statement after visiting a manual snow survey in the Sierra Nevadas. ""This historic drought demands unprecedented action.""

For the first time in the state's history, the governor has directed the State Water Resources Control Board to implement mandatory water reductions across California, in an effort to reduce water usage by 25 percent. The measures include replacing 50 million square feet of lawns throughout the state with drought-tolerant landscaping, banning the watering of grass on public street medians, requiring agricultural water users to report their water use to state regulators, and requiring large landscapes such as campuses, golf courses and cemeteries to make significant cuts in water use.

The governor’s announcement comes just a few weeks after NASA’s top water scientist, Jay Famiglietti, declared in a Los Angeles Times op-ed that California only had a year's-worth of water supply left in its reservoirs.

The last four years have been the driest in California’s recorded history. As of March 24, more than 98 percent of California is suffering from abnormally dry conditions, with 41.1 percent in an exceptional drought, according the U.S. Drought Monitor, which estimates that more than 37 million Californians have been affected by the drought. The state’s snowpack, which is largely responsible for feeding the state’s reservoirs, has been reduced to 8 percent of its historical average, and in some areas in the Central Valley the land is sinking a foot a year because of over-pumping of groundwater for agriculture.

In January 2014, Brown declared a state of emergency and directed state officials to take all necessary actions to prepare for water shortages. The announcement was quickly followed with the launch of a website, www.SaveOurWater.com, aimed to help Californians make reductions in water use. Tips include everything from reducing shower time to planting drought-resistant trees and plants.

“We are in an unprecedented, very serious situation,” the governor said in his January statement. “At some point, we have to learn to live with nature, we have to get on nature’s side and not abuse the resources that we have.”

Californians use an average of 181 gallons of water each day, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.

The winter wet season was a big disappointment for water conservationists. Half of the state’s annual rainfall usually arrives in December, January and February, and although there were brief stormy periods, California recorded less rain in January than any January before it: less than two inches. In March, the state announced emergency legislation to fast-track more than $1 billion in funding for drought relief and water infrastructure projects, after the State Water Board released a report outlining a steep decline in water conservation during the month of January.

California is not the only state struggling with drought. In Nevada, the Lake Tahoe Basin’s snowpack is reported to be at 3 percent of its normal average, prompting the primary water provider in the Reno-Sparks area to urge customers to cut water use by 10 percent on Tuesday. In Texas, more than half the state is currently suffering under abnormally dry conditions, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor."

She was 17.

Hayley Okines, of Bexhill, England, managed to survive four years longer than doctors predicted after she was diagnosed as an infant with the genetic disorder Hutchinson-Gilford syndrome, more commonly known as progeria.

She died after a brief battle of pneumonia, according to BBC News, and her death was confirmed by the Progeria Research Foundation.

Audrey Gordon, executive director for the Progeria Research Foundation, said Hayley had helped educate millions about the rare disease.

""She was a pioneer -- one of the first participants in the clinical drug trials and other research that initiated our progress toward treatments and cure -- and one of the reasons that we now have the first treatment for Progeria,"" said Gordon. ""It took tremendous courage and determination by Hayley, her family and others like them to bring us to this point of progress, and we join her family and millions of people around the world in mourning her passing.""

Hayley had helped raise awareness about her rare disease by posting about her progeria online and co-writing two books about growing up with the disorder, the first published when she was 13.

The entire Progeria family mourns together with many as we say goodbye to Hayley Okines, our smart, beautiful and...

Progeria is an extremely rare genetic disorder and affects one out of every 4 million to 8 million births, and an estimated 250 children have the disease across the globe, according to the Progeria Research Foundation. The disorder causes children to age prematurely at a rate somewhere between eight and 10 times faster than normal children. Symptoms of the disorder include baldness, stunted growth and a loss of fat in their bodies.

Children with progeria report symptoms of aging at extremely young ages, including arthritis, osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease. Children often die due to cardio-related events around age 14, according to the Progeria Research Foundation.

In an interview with ABC News' ""20/20"" in 2011, Hayley's mother Kerry Okines said her daughter's health was ""always"" on her mind.

""The first thing I think about when I get up in the morning, 'Is today going to be the day that we lose her?'"" Okines said in 2011.

Hayley was one of just a handful of children diagnosed in the United Kingdom. She was given treatment in a clinical trial in an effort to stall the deterioration by her premature aging.

""I feel like I have a future to plan,"" she told ABC News in a 2012 interview. ""I think that maybe when I grow up, I will get married. Mum says it will have to be someone very special to see beyond my progeria.""

Hayley said during that interview that she felt the treatment helped her become ""stronger and taller.""

Angela Collins and Margaret Elizabeth Hanson of Port Hope, Canada, filed a lawsuit against Atlanta-based Xytex Corporation this week, alleging that they were misled about the identity of their sperm donor, who was described as a doctoral student in engineering.

The women allege in that lawsuit that they were originally told that their donor was healthy, had an IQ of 160 and was working on a Ph.D. degree in neuroscience engineering. The couple claim in the suit that Xytex offered a lengthy vetting process of donors.

After Collins successfully gave birth to a son in 2007 using the sperm provided from Xytex, the couple say they kept in touch with people from Xytex as their son grew up. However, in 2014, the couple said they were alarmed to get a series of emails from the company that breached the confidentiality of their donor.

After the company revealed the donor's name, the couple ""discovered for the first time that defendants representations had been false,"" according to the lawsuit.

The couple got in touch with other families who used the same donor to have children, and together made a series of alarming discoveries about the alleged donor, James Christian Aggeles, named as a co-defendant in the lawsuit. Their research revealed that Aggeles was diagnosed with schizophrenia, had dropped out of college and was arrested for burglary, according to the lawsuit, which noted that the information was taken in part from the Facebook pages of Aggeles and his parents, in addition to YouTube.

Aggeles is suspecting of having fathered 36 children through donated sperm, according to the lawsuit.

Online court records found by ABC News confirm that Aggeles was indicted for burglary in 2005. Aggeles went to jail for 8 months before receiving a 10-year probation, records show, but was able to get the criminal record cleared under a ""first offender"" law, the office of the Superior Court told the Atlanta Constitution-Journal.

The couple also alleges in the lawsuit that a large mole was removed from Aggele's photo by the Xytex Corporation.

Nancy Hersh, the couple's San Francisco-based lawyer, said Hanson and Collins were debating whether to speak to the press. Hersh said she is working with 15 clients who used Aggeles as a donor. Between them they have 22 children, she said.

Calls from ABC News to Aggeles' listed number were not immediately returned.

The couple is suing Xytex on multiple counts, including fraud and negligent misrepresentation to pay for damages. The couple is also asking for money to set up a medical monitoring fund so that they can monitor their son for signs of schizophrenia."

Indiana Governor Mike Pence signed a ""religious freedom"" bill in private on Thursday that allows businesses to refuse service to gays and lesbians for religious reasons.

Cook tweeted today that he is calling on Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson to veto a similar bill in his state.

Apple is open for everyone. We are deeply disappointed in Indiana's new law and calling on Arkansas Gov. to veto the similar #HB1228.

Around the world, we strive to treat every customer the same — regardless of where they come from, how they worship or who they love.

Supporters of the Indiana law say it prevents the government from compelling people to provide services such as wedding photography for same-sex weddings or other activities they find objectionable on religious grounds.

""This bill is not about discrimination,"" Pence had said, ""and if I thought it legalized discrimination I would have vetoed it.""

Salesforce.com, which bought ExactTarget in Indiana in 2013, is asking other tech companies to respond to Indiana's law. Salesforce.com CEO Marc Benioff was among the CEOs who signed a letter to Gov. Pence on Wednesday.

The blackout -- the worst in Turkey for over a decade -- has affected around 40 provinces. In Istanbul traffic lights and much of the city’s subway went dark after power stopped around 10:30 a.m., officials said.

Local airports were forced to close and flights are disrupted.

Engen Bas, an Istanbul-based journalist working for ABC News, said that most major public facilities were running on backup generators and that Internet coverage was also down in some places.

The reason for the blackout is so far unexplained. With officials only able to speculate, rumors of cyber-attacks and terror threats quickly appeared. Turkish prime minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, said that the most likely cause was problems with transmission lines but said he could not rule out terrorism.

“This is not an incident we see frequently,” said energy minister, Yaner Yildiz, currently on an official visit to Slovakia.

“Whether or not terrorism is a high possibility or a low I can’t say at this stage. I can’t say either whether it’s a cyber-attack,” he told Turkish TV."

A new national ABC News/Washington Post poll also finds sharply politicized views of U.S.-Israel relations, which have been strained by the two allies’ dispute over the advisability of an agreement with Iran.

See PDF for full results, charts and tables.

In a result that supports the Obama administration’s position in the face of Republican and Israeli criticisms alike, Americans by 59-31 percent back a plan to lift major economic sanctions against Iran in exchange for restrictions making it harder for it to produce nuclear weapons.

The finding in the survey, produced for ABC by Langer Research Associates, is in concert with longstanding preferences for diplomatic rather than military solutions to international conflicts, when possible. It comes as Secretary of State John Kerry seeks a framework for an agreement, working with negotiators from Iran, Great Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China. Their self-imposed deadline was today.

While still a clear majority, support for a deal has slipped slightly from 64 percent in November 2013. It comes even though 59 percent are not particularly confident that such an agreement would achieve its goal of preventing Iran from developing nuclear arms. Support endures because even among those who are “not so confident” that an agreement will work, most still think it’s worth a try. Among those who are not at all confident, by contrast, most are opposed.

Support for an agreement peaks at 72 percent among liberals and 68 percent among Democrats, but also draws majorities of moderates and independents, 63 and 60 percent, respectively. Indeed, it’s backed by 46 percent of conservatives and 47 percent of Republicans -- at least as many, in both groups, as oppose it. Forty-seven GOP U.S. senators wrote a letter to Tehran earlier this month opposing a deal, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accepted an invitation from Republican leaders to deliver an address to Congress criticizing the approach.

ISRAEL -- The poll finds both Obama and Netanyahu underwater in their handling of U.S.-Israel relations. Just 38 percent approve of Obama’s handling of relations with Israel, and 37 percent approve of Netanyahu’s work on relations with the United States. Fifty and 44 percent, respectively, disapprove.

There’s vast partisanship in these views, marking the sharply politicized nature of current relations between the two longtime allies. Obama’s approval for handling relations with Israel ranges from 66 percent among Democrats to 34 percent of independents and a mere 8 percent of Republicans. Opinions on Netanyahu run the other way; 59 percent of Republicans approve of his handling of U.S. relations, vs. 37 percent of independents and just 21 percent of Democrats.

Lastly, the poll finds essentially a split decision on the establishment of a Palestinian state, a cornerstone of U.S. policy that Netanyahu appeared to call into question during his recent re-election campaign. While many are undecided, 39 percent support establishment of a Palestinian state on the West Bank and Gaza Strip, while 36 percent are opposed. That’s backed off from 58-22 percent in a Gallup poll in June 2003, as the Bush administration pushed its “Roadmap for Peace.”

Rather than partisanship, ideology is the stronger factor in attitudes on a Palestinian state. Support ranges from 58 percent among liberals to 41 percent of moderates, then drops to 30 percent of “somewhat” conservative Americans -- and just 18 percent of those who are “very” conservative. Strikingly, there were no such divisions in 2003.

METHODOLOGY – This ABC News/Washington Post poll was conducted by landline and cellular telephone March 26-29, 2015, in English and Spanish, among a random national sample of 1,003 adults. Results have a margin of sampling error of 3.5 points, including design effect.

Twenty-five people on board the Air Canada A320 were injured in the hard landing after the jet hit an array antenna on the ground. Considering the considerable damage to the plane, it was fortunate that no one was seriously hurt, officials said.

""They touched down 1,100 feet before the runway,"" Michael Cunningham of the Transportation Safety Board of Canada said. ""I'd say they are pretty lucky.""

The landing gear came off after the plane hit the runway, according to Cunningham, and the plane then skidded another 1,100 feet on its belly before it came to a stop. The passengers were then evacuated, Cunningham said.

""Didn't hesitate -- just jumped out onto the wing, we started running away from the plane,"" passenger Dominic Stettler said.

The underside of the plane suffered significant damage, Cunningham said. The nose cone broke off and one of the plane's two engines detached.

""I was really scared,"" Leon Yu said. ""We slid down a thing, and we saw the engine a couple hundred feet from the plane.""

Of the 25 passengers and crew members who were hospitalized, all but one had been released as of Sunday afternoon, according to Air Canada.

The TSB will have about 12 to 15 investigators at the scene on Monday.

""It's too early to draw any conclusions about this occurrence,"" Cunningham said this afternoon.

The black boxes have been recovered and are heading to Ottawa to be analyzed, Cunningham said.

Halifax Stanfield International Airport spokesman Peter Spurway said the pilots were in control of the plane up until the hard landing.

Spurway said there was snow on the runway but it hadn't yet been determined whether that was a factor in the hard landing. The airport also suffered a power interruption around the same time of the incident, but it was unclear whether the two events were related.

""It was safe to land in this weather,"" said Air Canada Chief Operating Officer Klaus Goersch.

The pilots are 15-year veterans of Air Canada, Goersch added, with ""many years"" of experience flying the A320.

Goersch said that the plane was checked Saturday, which was its most recent scheduled maintenance check.

The airport was closed to all air traffic for several hours after the crash before reopening.

Again, operations are resuming. Expect changes to flight schedules, please check ahead."

The Cincinnati Reds have debuted what's thought to be the first suite in Major League Baseball for nursing moms and their offspring -- the Reds fans of the future.

During the off season, the Cincinnati Reds partnered with Pampers and local homebuilder Fischer Homes to create the suite.

The decision was made after Reds Chief Operating Officer Phil Castellini was informed by the Great American Ball Park operations staff that an increasing number of moms were requesting a quiet and private place to feed their babies while at a Reds game.

The suite features gliders, changing station, a kitchenette with a sink, ice and refrigerator, lockers for storing items and, most importantly, a flat-screen TV so mom doesn't miss a home run. It's located on the Suite Level near the Champions Club elevators.

The suite will be ready to welcome tiny fans and moms on April 6 to coincide with Opening Day."

Lisa Avila, 36, of Anaheim, California, was 12 weeks pregnant when she woke up on Valentine's Day with severe pain in her abdomen, her aunt, Jessica Jule, said at a news conference Tuesday. Doctors at Anaheim Regional Medical Center's emergency room did an ultrasound, said her baby was fine and sent her away with a prescription for painkillers, Jule said.

The ectopic pregnancy ruptured, causing her to bleed internally, the aunt said.

""She needed emergency surgery to stop the bleeding,"" Jule said at the news conference outside the hospital.

The next day, Avila, who has seven other children, slipped into a coma, Jule said.

""Why did they make my niece leave this hospital when obviously there was something wrong?"" Jule said. ""How could they say the baby was fine if it was an ectopic pregnancy and you did an ultrasound?""

Avila's family, including Jule, could not be reached by ABC News for comment.

Anaheim Regional Medical Center released the following statement:

""Patient safety is Anaheim Regional Medical Center’s foremost priority and we are committed to providing the highest quality care to every patient we serve. The physicians, nurses and staff at Anaheim Regional Medical Center care deeply for the health of this patient and our thoughts and prayers go out to her and her family. Patient privacy laws prevent us from sharing any additional information.""

Ectopic pregnancies are relatively common and occur in about 1 percent of all pregnancies, said Dr. Marjorie Greenfield, chief of general obstetrics and gynecology at UH Case Medical Center in Cleveland, Ohio. As a result, hospitals have experience spotting and treating them, she said.

""Some of them are very easy to diagnose, and they get diagnosed every day in the emergency room,"" she said, explaining that if a woman has a positive pregnancy test, but a doctor can't spot the embryo in the ""frame"" of her uterus on an ultrasound, that's usually enough to diagnose an ectopic pregnancy.

But sometimes a doctor can't spot an ectopic pregnancy until he or she operates, said Dr. Keith Eddleman, director of obstetrics at The Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan.

""If you have a patient in the first trimester with abdominal pain and bleeding and you can't see the pregnancy inside the uterus -- and you have a positive pregnancy test -- you have to assume it's ectopic until proven otherwise because it is life-threatening,"" Eddleman said.

Although most ectopic pregnancies develop in the fallopian tubes, they can also develop on the ovary or elsewhere in the abdomen, but it's extremely rare, said Dr. Jennifer Ashton ,a senior medical contributor for ABC News and practicing obstetrician-gynecologist. Another rare possibility that would make an ectopic pregnancy harder to diagnose would be something called a heterotopic pregnancy, or when one embryo starts developing in the uterus and another starts developing in the fallopian tube.

Ectopic pregnancies usually rupture at about five or six weeks, when the fallopian tube can't stretch to hold the developing embryo as it grows, so a 12-week ectopic pregnancy is unusual, Greenfield said.

""Ruptured ectopic pregnancy is the number one cause of maternal mortality in the first trimester,"" Ashton said. ""If it ruptures, women can lose liters of blood very quickly.""

Signs include pelvic pain on one side, dark red vaginal bleeding and a positive pregnancy test, Ashton said. Because they ultimately lead to life-threatening miscarriages, treatment for ectopic pregnancy is usually surgery or medication to end the pregnancy.

None of these doctors has treated Avila."

After spending over three years going through chemotherapy, Rhett Krawitt, 7, remains unprotected against certain illnesses, including the measles. So the boy and his family this week asked his local school district to support new legislation that would abolish personal-belief exemptions, which allow families to opt out of required vaccinations, according to ABC station KGO-TV in San Francisco.

To speak to the Reed Union School District, the boy stood on a chair to reach the microphone.

""Soon we will say Gone with the Measles,"" he said. ""My name is Rhett and I give a damn!""

Rhett and his Corte Madera, California, family asked the Reed Union School District to support state legislation introduced by state senator and pediatrician Dr. Richard Pan that would abolish personal-belief exemptions that allow students to attend school without being fully vaccinated. For the current school year, 5.89 percent of kindergartners in Marin County have a personal-belief exemption.

The family first made headlines last month after NPR reported they asked their local school districts to ban unvaccinated children from the school after a measles outbreak started in Southern California. Rhett attends school in Marin County in California, where just over 84 percent of kindergartners are fully vaccinated, according to the California Department of Public Health.

""The importance of vaccinations is about the expectant mothers and babies under the age one and hundreds of children who are at risk for getting these disease that don’t even need to be here,"" Carl Krawitt told ABC News. ""It’s really around making sure that we have public health policy that protects everyone in our community.""

The multistate outbreak of measles that started in Disneyland in December has infected at least 121 people, with 99 of those infections in California, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

After the family’s plea, the school district voted to support legislation introduced by Pan.

Carl Krawitt also told ABC News that son Rhett will meet with his doctors to determine whether his immune system is healthy enough to get a measles vaccination.

Krawitt said the importance of vaccinations was underscored again Wednesday after the Contra Costa Public Health Department alerted Bay Area California residents that a passenger on the Bay Area Rapid Transport (BART) public transportation system has been infected with measles, meaning other passengers could have been exposed to the contagious virus.

""I’m not going to take BART on Saturday and I really wanted to,"" Krawitt said. ""There are certain things we will and won’t do"" to protect Rhett."

Elite runner Hyvon Ngetich was leading the pack 23 miles into the Austin Marathon this weekend, but then her body just couldn't go any further. Ngetich found herself on all fours, but she refused to accept a wheelchair and crawled the final few miles to the finish line, she told local TV station KHOU.

""You ran the bravest race and crawled the bravest crawl I have ever seen in my life,"" race director John Conley told her afterwards. ""You have earned much honor.""

When asked why she didn't quit, Ngetich, a native of Kenya, said, ""Running, always you have to keep going, going.""

But Dr. Laura Goldberg, a sports medicine specialist at Cleveland Clinic and medical director of the Cleveland Marathon, said sometimes runners just need to stop.

""For the non-elite crowd, there should never be a reason why runner a should crawl to the finish,"" Goldberg said. ""I get nervous about hearing this story, how it translates through the general population.""

She said dehydration, overheating and muscle cramping could have all led Ngetich to crawl to the finish line, but non-elite runners shouldn't follow her example no matter how miraculous her perseverance.

Here's what to look for:

-Your mental status has changed. While it's normal for runners' thinking to change slightly during a marathon due to exhaustion, if you forget where you are or why you're running, stop, Goldberg said. This can be a sign of overheating, an electrolyte problem, dehydration or something else, said Dr. Carl ""Chip"" Lavie, a cardiologist at the Ochsner Center in New Orleans.

-You've stopped sweating or you have chills. This means your body isn't able to regulate its temperature properly. ""Sweat is a way to let off heat,"" Goldberg said.

-Cramping is all over. Runners are used to cramps, but if it's a body-wide feeling, don't push through it, she said.

-Your heart is racing faster than usual. This can be a sign your heart is in trouble, and you could pass out even if you're an elite runner, Lavie said.

-You're experiencing chest pain, shortness of breath or feeling faint. Again, your heart is telling you it's in trouble, and you should stop, he said.

Though distance runners are used to pushing through pain, Lavie said they should recognize when it's time to stop."

The partial skull fragment, which is believed to be female, was excavated from a cave in western Galilea in the Middle East. Using shape analysis, scientists said the skull is similar to both recent African skulls from the time period and some European upper paleolithic fossils.

The finding sheds new light on when early humans left Africa and migrated through the Middle East before colonizing Europe.

It is believed to be the first proof of humans living in the Levant region during that time, according to findings published in the journal ""Nature."" The Levant region is the area in the Middle East that encompasses modern-day countries including Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine and Syria.

While the skull fragment does not include facial features, scientists wrote that it is ""unequivocally modern."" The discovery supports the belief that modern humans (Homo sapiens) and Neanderthals may have lived side by side in the Levant around the time interbreeding is believed to have occurred.

Neanderthal remains have previously been excavated from areas near the cave also dating back to around the same time period."

The explosion led to the collapse of 30 percent of the hospital building and the injuries to at least 54 people, including 22 children, according to Mancera.

Not all the injuries were serious, Mancera said, adding that many of those injured were hit with flying glass after the explosion.

“Today is Texas Muslim Capital [sic] Day in Austin,” newly-elected Republican state Rep. Molly White wrote on Facebook. “I did leave an Israeli flag on the reception desk in my office with instructions to staff to ask representatives from the Muslim community to renounce Islamic terrorist groups.”

“We will see how long they stay in my office,” she added.

Texas Muslim Capitol Day, an initiative organized by the Texas Chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, serves as “an opportunity to benefit Texans state-wide by urging lawmakers to support issues that affect people of all faiths,” according to the CAIR website.

In response to White’s post, CAIR Government Affairs Manager Robert McCaw sent a letter to Texas Speaker Joe Straus asking if White violated any House ethics rules by “creating such an internal office policy that is selectively being enforced to discriminate against certain religious minorities.”

""The Texas Capitol belongs to all the people of this state, and legislators have a responsibility to treat all visitors just as we expect to be treated -- with dignity and respect,"" Straus said in a statement to ABC News. ""Anything else reflects poorly on the entire body and distracts from the very important work in front of us.""

""I welcome all of my constituents who would like to come and visit our office in the Texas State Capitol,"" White said in a statement to ABC. ""As law abiding American citizens, we all have the privilege and the right to freedom of speech granted to us by the First amendment, and believe fully in the democracy that our nation is founded upon. As a proud Texan and American I fully denounce all terrorist groups or organizations who’s intent is to hurt and destroy the great state of Texas and our Nation.""

In a comment on Facebook, White wrote, “I do not apologize for my comments. ... if you love America, obey our laws and condemn Islamic terrorism, then I embrace you as a fellow American. If not, then I do not.”

“Isn’t it amazing when you stand for America, our allies and against terrorism how much vile and angry responses you get? I will never cow to anti Americanism and extremists,” she wrote in another comment. “I am banning users that are insulting.""

In a post earlier today, the Texas lawmaker insisted that “becoming an American” is “not the intent of most Muslims who move to America.”

""Remember, in the Koran, it is ok to lie for the purpose of advancing Islam,"" she wrote. “Texas must never allow fringe groups of people to come here so they can advance their own culture instead of becoming an American.”

Her message was echoed by a slew of protesters at the Capitol. A few dozen men and women waving signs proclaiming “Go home and take Obama with you,” “Muhammad is dead” and “Radical Islam is the New Nazi” protested against the Muslim community members standing on the Capitol steps.

“Islam and the false prophet Muhammad -- Islam will never dominate the United States, and by the grace of God, it will not dominate Texas,” one protester yelled before she was removed by an officer at the scene.

“Muhammad is dead!” she screamed as she was dragged away. “Muhammad did nothing but made himself a pervert. We love America, we love Jesus Christ!”

Carter appeared in the moment undistracted, talking about his solemn duty to tend to the troops “with the greatest reflection and care.”

The vice president’s office declined to comment about the vice president's whisper.

Perhaps Biden, who moments earlier administered the oath, was checking to see if his wife was OK after her spill in the snow and ice earlier Tuesday. She apparently slipped when getting out of her car at the Pentagon.

When Biden and Stephanie Carter first greeted each other in the Roosevelt Room before the swearing in, the VP was overheard telling her, “We get a whole team. We get two for one.”"

President Obama introduced the topic in a PSA by urging people that sexual violence is ""not OK -- and it has to stop."" Obama added that people should take to social and spread the word via the ""It's On Us"" campaign.

Next, Brooke Axtell, a survivor of domestic abuse, took the stage and told her story.

""Authentic love does not devalue another human being,"" she said. ""Authentic love does not silence, shame or abuse. If you are in a relationship with someone who does not honor and respect you, I want you to know that you are worthy of love. Please reach out for help, your voice will save you ... let it part the darkness, let it set you free to know who you truly are -- valuable, beautiful, loved.""

Axtell has been inspiring others to leave abusive relationships for years.

According to Salon, this incredible young woman penned an essay in the book, ""What I Know of Silence,"" which explored her experience of child sex-trafficking by a male nanny.

Axtell, 34, is now a poet and activist and lives in Austin, Texas, running communications for Allies Against Slavery.

After Axtell spoke, Katy Perry took the stage and sang ""By the Grace of God,"" one of the most inspiring and emotional moments of the night.

""I was immediately excited by the opportunity to bring the issue of domestic violence into the light,"" Axtell told Salon. ""We know that 1 out of 4 women in the United States will experience domestic violence in their lifetime. Our collaboration for the Grammys is a creative, intimate way to highlight this devastating trauma that impacts so many lives and show those who are currently in abusive relationships that we are standing with them."""

Officer Eric Parker was charged with assault, according to police in Madison, Alabama. The department's police chief, Larry Muncey, said that he recommended Parker be fired.

Sureshbhai Patel said he was visiting his son's family when he was stopped by police on Feb. 6 while walking in the neighborhood. A man had reported him as a suspicious person, according to a 911 call released by police.

Dashcam video released by police shows an officer throwing Patel, 57, to the ground. In a lawsuit filed in federal court, Patel alleges that he suffered a severe neck injury that left him partially paralyzed.

Patel's attorney says he speaks little English and was accosted because of his brown skin, according to The Associated Press.

The FBI is investigating, according to Madison police. Parker did not have an attorney, the Associated Press reported."
1A5k4UC,2015-02-18 00:00:00,"Las Vegas 'Road Rage' Victim Went Looking for Suspect Before Deadly Encounter, Police Say - ABC News",http://abcnews.go.com/US/las-vegas-road-rage-victim-suspect-deadly-encounter/story?id=29018018,"A woman who was fatally shot after an apparent ""road rage"" incident went looking for the suspect with her armed son, police said, and was likely not followed home immediately after the street encounter as was previously thought.

Police now believe it was only after Tammy Meyers and her 22-year-old son went out and found the suspect Thursday that they were apparently followed home, said Lt. Ray Steiber, who is in charge of the homicide section at the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department.

“There was a volley of rounds fired from that vehicle,” Steiber said at a news conference Tuesday, adding that the son then returned fire. “All indications ... are that this unknown person had fired shots first.”

Meanwhile, a candlelight vigil was held Tuesday evening outside Walter Johnson Junior High School, where Meyers was giving her 15-year-old daughter a driving lesson in the parking lot before the encounter.

""I did what I had to do to protect my family,” Brandon Meyers, the son who fired at the car, said at the vigil. “And I'd do it for anyone I love.”

The daughter, 15, told the 75 or so people at the vigil: ""I was in the car with her. There's so much I can say about my mom. My mom was protecting me that night and she was doing what any mom would do. She was my everything, my best friend. She did everything she could possibly do to protect me and I love her so much.""

Meyers, 44, died Saturday at the University Medical Center of Southern Nevada.

Steiber said the homicide section took over the case from the violent crimes section after Meyers died, and is still reviewing the timeline and other aspects of the case. He said the adjusted timeline was heavily based upon the accounts of the daughter and son who were in the car with Meyers that night.

“What I think everybody wants is an accurate timeline and an accurate depiction of what occurred,” Steiber said.

Police now believe there was no collision, as had been previously reported, before Myers and her daughter were verbally confronted by the ""road rage"" suspect.

Instead, Steiber said, after Meyers and her 15-year-old daughter completed a late-night driving lesson in a school parking lot, Meyers took over driving duties and was headed home. Once on the road, a four-door silver or grey sedan pulled up aggressively behind Meyers' car and then tried to pass, prompting Meyers' daughter to reach over and honk the horn.

The sedan then stopped in front of Meyers' car and someone got out, Steiber said.

“From the information that we had gathered at this point, we don’t believe that Ms. Meyers or her daughter ever said anything to the person or persons they were involved in the road rage incident with,” Steiber added.

“Meyers sped past the male ... and she continued on her way,” he said. ""Mrs. Meyers is scared, she’s upset.”

Once home, Meyers asked her daughter to fetch the 22-year-old son, Brandon, who armed himself and joined Tammy Meyers in the car, Steiber said. The pair went looking for the ""road rage"" suspect and found him, before losing track of him again, Steiber said.

The suspect has been described by police as a white male, about 25 years old, 6 feet tall and 180 pounds. He has ""dirty blonde hair worn in a spiked style and has hazel or blue eyes,"" police have said.

“We have not yet identified a suspect pertaining to this murder,” Steiber added today.

After losing track of the suspect, Meyers and her son returned home again, Steiber said, but soon the suspect vehicle pulled up, gunfire erupted and Meyers was fatally wounded.

Police began receiving calls about the shooting incident at 11:22 p.m., Steiber said.

One of Meyers' four children spoke with ABC News, expressing shock after her death.

""We're not used to waking up and not seeing our mom,"" Matt Meyers, 19, told ABC News.

1A6fs2i,2015-02-09 00:00:00,See Neil Armstrong's Mementos That Were Supposed to Be Left on the Moon - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/US/neil-armstrongs-mementos-supposed-left-moon/story?id=28831018,"In the fall of 2012, after Neil Armstrong died that summer, his widow, Carol Armstrong, found a bag full of personal mementos from 1969's Apollo 11 mission in the astronaut's closet.

Carol Armstrong contacted the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum, whose curator learned that these were personal items intended to be left on the moon.

""She called and said she found this white cloth bag in Neil's closet,"" Allan Needell, curator of the Apollo collection at the Smithsonian, told ABC News today. ""She said it looked like there were things from a spacecraft in there and would we be interested.""

Carol Armstrong sent a photo to the museum, and Needell said ""once we found out what they were, we went to work documenting.""

The ""temporary storage bag"" Carol Armstrong found had about 17 Apollo-related items inside, including utility lights with power cables, a waist tether and netting, according to the Smithsonian, which unveiled its research into the items on Friday.

One of the most important items was a 16mm movie data acquisition camera, which was used to film the moon landing, ""as well as Neil Armstrong's and Buzz Aldrin's activities on the lunar surface, including taking the first samples of lunar soil and planting the U.S. flag,"" the Smithsonian reports.

""These items were cataloged items and basically scheduled to be left in the lunar module,"" Needell told ABC News. ""We have some evidence ... these were just surplus items they were taking home.""

""There was only so much room on the spacecraft on the way back,"" Needell said, and priority went to scientific samples such as moon dust and rocks. ""A lot of stuff gets left behind on the moon. It wasn't as though they could pack up everything they brought.""

""What many of the astronauts did once things were surplus and basically not required for science or other missions ... certain items that astronauts have managed to keep as sort of personal momenta. Control handles, or something like that,"" Needell said.

""I think probably it was unspoken tradition to do some of that,"" Needell added. ""This is not uncommon. Many other astronauts had personal collections of souvenirs.""

The items found in Armstrong's closet ""had no more mission significance,"" Needell said. ""They were no longer needed. The camera, for instance, is a cartridge camera. All the cartridges with film were taken back, but once they were finished filming, they had no need for the camera anymore.""

It was intended for the camera to have ""have been left in the spacecraft and destroyed"" but ""Neil decided to take it home.""

It was ""the camera that took pictures of the landing,"" Needell said, noting it was an ""emotionally significant item.""

Needell said he doesn't think Armstrong was purposely hiding the memorabilia. ""He was a very private person,"" he noted. ""This was characteristic of him.""

Needell's own guess is that the items are a ""personal souvenir of an extraordinary episode in his own life.""

Several of the items, including the camera and waist tether, are already on display in a new gallery about 50 years of spacewalking, Needell said. The others are still being cataloged."
1A6gZ6N,2015-02-18 00:00:00,Aaron Hernandez Trial: How Prosecutors Linked the Former Patriots Star to Murder - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/US/aaron-hernandez-trial-gum-purchased-found-attached-shell/story?id=29047477,"A Massachusetts detective testified that bubble gum was found attached to a bullet shell casing that was recovered from a car Aaron Hernandez had rented -- evidence, prosecutors say, that linked him to the murder of Odin Lloyd.

North Attleborough Police Det. Michael Elliott said they were called by a rental car company employee, who told them that several items had been removed from a car Hernandez rented and put in a trash bin.

Elliott said investigators searched that garbage bin and found the spent shell casing attached to the piece of gum.

Throughout the trial, the defense has questioned how police handled evidence in the case.

Hernandez, 25, bought Blue Cotton Candy Bubblicious gum at a gas station just hours before he allegedly shot Lloyd in an industrial lot at 3 a.m. on June 17, 2013, prosecutors have said in court documents.

After Elliot's testimony, a rental car company manager supported the police's account, testifying today that she found a shell casing inside a vehicle Hernandez had rented.

Keelia Smyth, who worked at Enterprise Rent-a-Car at the time, said she found the bullet casing while cleaning the rented Nissan Altima after the former NFL star had returned it. Not knowing Lloyd had been murdered, she said she put the shell casing she found -- along with some chewed blue-colored gum and a bottle of Vitamin Water -- inside a trash bin.

Smyth said she didn't realize the importance of the car or its contents until she saw media reports of Lloyd's murder. That's when she called the police, who recovered the gum and shell casing.

The defense questioned the findings, saying that Hernandez's DNA may have transferred to the gum in a state police lab.

On Tuesday, prosecutors played a police surveillance video of the former NFL star allegedly dismantling his phone while inside a rental car a day after Lloyd's death.

Before playing the video, Elliot had testified that a few hours after Hernandez left the police station, he saw the former New England Patriots player from the closed-circuit police camera sitting in his lawyer's car, breaking down his cell phone.

On cross examination, Elliot conceded that Hernandez did not smash his Blackberry, but instead had just slid the back cover to take out the battery.

Prosecutors claim Hernandez used the phone to call co-defendant Ernest Wallace.

Lloyd, 27, had been dating Hernandez's fiancee's sister at the time of his death.

1A6tU8M,2015-02-19 00:00:00,Former Federal Judge Regrets 55-Year Marijuana Sentence - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/US/federal-judge-regrets-55-year-marijuana-sentence/story?id=28869467,"Weldon Angelos was just 24 years old when he was sentenced to 55 years in federal prison for three marijuana sales. He is one of the hundreds of thousands of federal prisoners serving decades-long sentences for non-violent crimes, thanks to mandatory minimum sentencing laws created in the 1980s during America’s war on drugs.

As a result, Angelos may not live long enough to experience freedom again. His case has haunted the federal judge that put him there.

""I do think about Angelos,” said Paul Cassell, a now-retired federal judge in the Utah circuit. “I sometimes drive near the prison where he’s held, and I think, ‘Gosh he shouldn’t be there. Certainly not as long as I had to send him there. ... That wasn’t the right thing to do. The system forced me to do it.”

Back in 2002, Angelos was an aspiring music producer and a father of two young boys living in Salt Lake City. Determined to make it big, he founded his own record company, eventually collaborating with big names like Snoop Dogg. But Angelos told ABC News he also started dealing pot on the side.

Federal authorities caught wind of Angelos’s dealings and set up three stings, using a criminal informant to buy about $1,000 worth of marijuana from him. But one critical detail made this case extraordinary -- during the deals, the criminal informant claimed Angelos had a gun in his possession.

The case went to federal court and Angelos was convicted of selling narcotics while in possession of a firearm. These offenses fall under mandatory minimum sentencing laws, and prosecutors treated each of the three marijuana deals as its own individual offense. This is what is called “stacking” the charges, and it means Angelos was facing three prison terms, stacked on top of each other. All in-- 55 years in prison, with no possibility of parole.

""A mandatory minimum is a sentence that says a judge has to impose a particular minimum number of years,” Cassell said. “It ties the judge’s hands… mandatory minimums can be used to send a message, but at some point the message gets lost.”

As many as 210,000 prisoners like Angelos are serving decades behind bars for non-violent crimes. The group Families Against Mandatory Minimums (FAMM) has complied hundreds of cases of non-violent offenders serving out what they call extreme prison sentences.

“The drug war totally drove the mandatory minimums that we’re still dealing with today” said Julie Stewart, founder of FAMM. “We have escalated punishments to the point that it’s crazy… Why does any non-violent offenders need to spend more than ten years in prison? Even that is a huge amount of time.”

Paul Cassell, who was appointed by President George W. Bush, now teaches law at the University of Utah. But he says the Angelos case still weighs on him, which is the reason he agreed to speak to “Nightline” about his ruling, something federal judges rarely do.

When Cassell delivered his ruling in the Angelos case, he was quick to point out how severe the sentence seemed compared to other, violent crimes.

“If he had been an aircraft hijacker, he would have gotten 24 years in prison. If he’s been a terrorist, he would have gotten 20 years in prison. If he was a child rapist, he would have gotten 11 years in prison. And now I’m supposed to give him a 55-year sentence? I mean, that’s just not right,”

“I think that most of the time, our federal justice system succeeds,” Cassell continued. “But there are some cases where it fails and the Angelos case is a prime example of that.”

Keeping offenders like Angelos in prison for virtual life sentences is also a heavy burden on the taxpayer -- Angelos alone will cost an estimated $1.5 million dollars by the time his sentence is through.

“I thought the sentence was utterly unjust to Weldon Angelos, but also unjust to the taxpayer,” Cassell pointed out. “I think it’s just a waste of resources to lock him up for 55 years, I don’t really think anyone believe that’s an appropriate sentence.""

Since Utah has no federal prisons, Angelos was sent to serve his time at a prison in California, thousands of miles away from his family.

Lisa Angelos remembers vividly the day when her brother was sentenced.

“The one thing he did say to me was that, we’ll never forget, he said ‘please, please help save my life,’ and I told him for as long as it takes, I will,” she said.

Lisa has made good on that promise, writing petitions, filing appeals, even testifying against the use of mandatory minimums in Congress. She’s partnered up with Families Against Mandatory Minimums to campaign for her brother’s release. But after years of trying, the only way Weldon Angelos will leave prison early is if he receives a commutation from President Obama.

""The President has to say, you have served enough time. It’s time to let you out,” says Julie Stewart, the president of FAMM, “And I’m optimistic that he will do that. Because Weldon’s case is an outrage.”

Lisa Angelos knows getting a presidential commutation is no easy task, but feels like her brother’s case may be strong enough. “I look at it and it doesn’t make sense. It’s like pennies worth of marijuana, how can somebody be doing life for that?”

Weldon Angelos is now 35 years old. He’ll be 78 by the time his 55 years are up.

His two young sons, Anthony and Jesse, are now teenagers, and haven’t seen their father for seven years—the last time they were able to buy a trip out to California.

“Being around them you can feel their heart ache, even though their laughter, and watching them play and do the fun stuff, you can still feel it,” Lisa Angelos said. “Seeing what they have gone through by losing their father, it just emotionally destroys me.”

Nearly every week, the boys talk on the phone with their father. During one such phone call, Weldon Angelos was able to talk to “Nightline” briefly.

“I mean it’s difficult to understand. I thought my sentence was definitely unnecessary,” Angelos said. “A 55-year sentence is not going to do any more than a five or 10 year sentence would have done, except take more of my life.”

Lisa said she will continue to fight for her brother’s freedom.

“To think that he will be in there until he is nearly 80 years old, I can’t give up on him, I just can’t do it,” she said."
1A7vKYd,2015-01-30 00:00:00,'Dragon' Dinosaur Fossil With Massive Neck Discovered in China - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/dragon-dinosaur-fossil-massive-neck-discovered-china/story?id=28609366,"Here's a dinosaur that really knows how to stick its neck out above the rest.

Called the ""dragon of Qijiang,"" for the Chinese city in which the fossil was found, the newly-discovered dinosaur species has a lightweight neck that spans half the length of its 50-foot body.

The dinosaur, a variety of sauropod, is believed to have lived 160 million years ago during the Late Jurassic period, according to paleontologists at the University of Alberta who excavated the fossils. Construction workers first uncovered the fossil in 2006, the researchers noted.

The physical attributes of the dinosaur, especially its long neck, are similar to the traits of mythical dragons, which inspired its name.

""I wonder if the ancient Chinese stumbled upon a skeleton of a long-necked dinosaur like Qijianglong and pictured that mythical creature,"" Tetsuto Miyashita, a paleontologist who worked on the project, said in a statement.

The findings were published on Wednesday in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology.

Carrying around such a long neck was surprisingly easy for the dinosaur, since paleontologists said they believe
its vertebrae were filled with air, making it lightweight despite its incredible size."
1A987NJ,2015-02-20 00:00:00,Senator: Guardrail Test Video ‘Hideously Shocking’ - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/US/senator-guardrail-test-video-hideously-shocking/story?id=29063976,"Even before the official government conclusions have been issued, Sen. Richard Blumenthal is calling the video of a guardrail safety test “hideously shocking.”

“The damage done to the driver’s side is very simply supposed to not happen and so that final test is deeply disturbing and gives me strong reason to say there ought to be more testing,” Blumenthal, D-Conn., told ABC News today.

Blumenthal was reacting to helicopter-shot video of a guardrail safety test conducted late last month in Texas, where the safety of Trinity Industries’ ET-Plus guardrail system – a system used on many roads across the country -- is under the microscope.

The government ordered eight crash tests after Trinity was found late last year to have committed fraud when it modified the guardrail end terminal a decade ago but failed to tell state or federal officials about the change at the time. Accident victims and critics say the modified guardrail end terminal can malfunction when struck from the front, sending pieces of metal through the car and potentially killing or dismembering its occupants.

The government said the ET-Plus system passed its first four crash tests, but it has not released the results of the last four. It’s the very last one, the eighth, that has proved controversial already after critics said the crash appeared to severely damage the driver’s side of the car. Trinity, however, disputes what it calls conclusions made far too early.

“You can’t judge a book by its cover, you can’t judge a crash test by pictures,” Jeff Eller, a Trinity spokesperson, told ABC News in the company’s first on-camera interview since ABC News started investigating the controversial guardrail last fall. “You’ve got to wait until all the data is analyzed, until it is looked at. Until you do that, you’re basically just making it up.”

Per the terms of the government’s agreement with Trinity on the crash tests, media was not allowed to take pictures on the ground during the crash tests, which is why early reactions on the test are based on aerial imagery from ABC News affiliate KSAT in San Antonio and on reports from inside the testing. ABC News producer Tonya Kerr was present for the tests, including the final one.

“It was a significant impact and it looked like substantial damage compared to tests in the past,” Kerr said of the eighth test.

Kerr said she was told there was no “intrusion,” meaning the guardrail did not pierce the vehicle – the alleged recurring problem described by real life accident victims.

The controversy over the final test has already sparked a battle between expert witnesses from either side of the Texas case – one accident expert who said it appears the test was a “clear failure” and another who said the first expert’s assertion was “premature, scientifically unsound and irresponsible.”

“It’s too soon to tell,” Eller said, echoing Trinity’s expert witness. “The data has to go to the Federal Highway Administration. They’ve got to take a look at it. They’re the ones who will make the final determination. And until then, anything other than waiting on that is nothing but pure speculation.”"
1AadYPt,2015-03-09 00:00:00,Spelunkers Unearth More Rare Objects in Israeli Cave - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/International/International/spelunkers-unearth-rare-coins-israeli-cave/story?id=29494370,"A month after the discovery of the largest cache of ancient coins ever hauled from the Mediterranean, spelunkers have unearthed another treasure trove of rare coins, silver and bronze objects in a cave in northern Israel.

Three members of the Israeli Caving Club, Reuven Zakai, Chen Zakai and a Lior Haloney recently lowered themselves into a well-hidden stalactite cave, wriggled through a narrow passageway and happened upon the shiny objects.

Archaeologists say the coins were likely minted during the reign of Alexander the Great, and the artifacts first date to the Chalcolithic period about 6,000 years ago; from the Early Bronze Age roughly 5,000 years ago, the Biblical period 3,000 years ago and the Hellenistic period approximately 2,300 years ago.

“The valuables might have been hidden in the cave by local residents who fled there during the period of governmental unrest stemming from the death of Alexander, a time when the Wars of the Diadochi broke out in Israel between Alexander’s heirs following his death,” according to archaeologists at the Israel Antiquities Authority. ""Presumably the cache was hidden in the hope of better days, but today we know that whoever buried the treasure never returned to collect it.""

Working off this discovery, archaeologists and geologists will be able to accurately date both the archaeological finds and the process of stalactite development, according to the Authority’s statement.

Amir Ganor, director of the Unit for the Prevention of Antiquities Robbery in the Israel Antiquities Authority, thanked the cavers for their “exemplary civic behavior,"" praising the ""citizens' awareness."" Following last month’s discovery by civilian scuba divers, Ganor welcomes this ""important trend."""

The Washington Post and BBC first reported the name early Thursday, with the Post citing a close friend who said he or she has ""no doubt"" that Emwazi is the man. A former senior U.S. intelligence official who was involved in the hunt for the man confirmed the name to ABC News.

British authorities have declined to comment on the man's identification. Commander Richard Walton of the London Metropolitan Police's Counter Terrorism Command (SO15) told BBC, ""We have previously asked media outlets not to speculate about the details of our investigation on the basis that life is at risk.""

A spokesperson for the White House National Security Council said they ""are not able to confirm or deny"" the reports on ""Jihadi John's"" identification, and referred questions to the British government.

""The U.S. government continues to investigate the murder of American citizens by ISIL [ISIS],"" the NSC said. ""As the President said, no matter how long it takes, the United States will not rest until we find and hold accountable the terrorists who are responsible for the murders of our citizens.""

The man who would be come to be known as ""Jihadi John"" first appeared in a string of disturbing videos produced by ISIS last August in which he appeared to slice the necks of Western hostages, including American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff. By September, the FBI said it had learned ""Jihadi John's"" identity, but it was not revealed to the public.

A spokesperson for the Sotloff family said today the family is “confident law enforcement would find him and bring him to justice and they have full confidence the U.S. government will be able to do that.”

“They would like to see him brought to a court in New York or eastern Virginia and watch him prosecuted by a U.S. court for beheading their son and convicted to life in a super max facility,” spokesperson Barak Barfi said. “This is how justice is served in this country.”

Bethany Haines, the daughter of British hostage David Haines who was purportedly killed in one of the ISIS videos, told Britain’s ITV that identifying “Jihadi John” was a good step, “but I think all the families will feel closure and relief once there’s a bullet between his eyes.”

Sen. Angus King, a member of the Senate Intelligence and Armed Services Committees, said that by identifying “Jihadi John” it sends a message to anyone who wants to hide “because they put something across their face.”

“Somebody once said, ‘None are so brave as the anonymous.’ I think that one of the things this message says to this guy is that they aren’t going to be anonymous. I would advise this guy right now not to buy any green bananas. I think justice is going to find him,” King said.

According to the BBC, Emwazi was born in Kuwait and was ""known"" to U.K. security agencies. Court documents linked Emwazi to suspected extremist figures, including one man who was killed by a drone strike in Somalia in 2012, the network said.

The Post reported he's believed to have traveled to Syria in 2012."

During her acceptance speech on behalf of ""Crisis Hotline: Veterans Press 1,"" the music abruptly cut off when Perry mentioned her son, Evan Scott Perry, who committed suicide at age 15 in 2005.

""I lost my son,"" Perry told reporters after the speech. ""We need to talk about suicide out loud to try to work against the stigma and silence around suicide because the best prevention for suicide is awareness and discussion and not trying sweep it under the rug.""

Perry also mentioned veteran suicide in her Oscar speech, which she called ""a crisis."" Tonight's Oscar-winning HBO documentary, directed by Perry and Ellen Goosenberg Kent, is about the Department of Veterans Affairs' 24-hour call center for veterans.

In 2009, Perry produced an HBO documentary about her son, who had bipolar disorder, called ""Boy Interrupted.""

""This is a movie one wishes one did not have to make. Maybe it will break down walls, and stigmas about talking openly about mental illness, to free people to do so without shame,"" Perry told ""The Huffington Post"" in 2009.

""The film asks a lot of questions in a public fashion and stirs up discussion about why we as a society are ashamed about mental illness,"" she continued. ""Educating people is a real challenge. And, education and treatment is the only suicide prevention. Let's get the word out.""

Perry’s family has a history of mental illness; she said her son's uncle also committed suicide, according to HBO.com.

Za'atari refugee camp now boasts a pizza delivery shop -- Pizzeria of Peace, or Mu'ajanat Esalam in Arabic.

Owned by Abu Mahmoud, 48, previously a Syrian electrician with no dough-making experience, Pizzeria of Peace opened its doors in the summer of 2013 but business was hurting. It wasn't quite catching on, Naserddine Touaibia, a Public Information and Mass Communication Associate for UNHCR, told ABC News.

""So they bought a bike, started delivering -- and now -- the business is really taking off.""

Pizzas made by Abu Mahmoud's 20-year-old business partner and chef, Yahya, go for about 70 cents a pie and the pizzeria now averages some 50 deliveries a day with a single bike. Touaibia admitted most of the clients are hungry humanitarian workers working in Za'atari, but says there are some refugee clients as well.

The menu ranges from a standard margherita pizza to a more traditional Syrian mince-meat topping.

""Oh, it's all delicious,"" Touaibia gushes. ""I'm a regular!""

Now home to 83,814 people according to the UNHCR, the pizzeria is one of 2,000 shops in Za'atari supporting an economy of $10 million a month, according to the U.N.

""All the shops are owned and run by refugees themselves -- it's a great example of resilience -- they do what they have to do to survive,"" said Touaibia."

Stephen Silva, 21, told the court that he would consider Tsarnaev ""one of my best friends.""

Silva is currently in prison after signing a plea deal with the government. He was the subject of an undercover federal investigation last year and pleaded guilty to charges including distribution of heroin, and possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number. While wearing a beige prison jumpsuit, Silva testified that two months before the bombings at the Boston Marathon finish line, he gave Tsarnaev a 9-millimeter handgun that had an ""obliterated"" serial number.

The gun was later used in the fatal shooting of MIT Police Officer Sean Collier, according to prosecutors, and during a shootout between Tsarnaev and police.

Tsarnaev, Silva said, told him he wanted to use the gun ""for a rip"" -- a robbery.

Silva also testified about an incident in high school, when a teacher asked if terrorism is ever justifiable.

Silva testified that Tsarnaev said, ""American foreign policy tends to be hostile ... trying to take over people's culture.""

Defense lawyers used the opportunity to elicit testimony that backed up their assertion that Tsarnaev was under the influence of his older brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, and that he was not himself a committed terrorist.

Under questioning by Tsarnaev's defense attorney, Miriam Conrad, Silva said that Tsarnaev ""talked religion not in depth, not all the time"" and described the suspect as not-violent and well liked. Conrad also emphasized that the pair enjoyed ""typical teenage things,"" like jumping off cliffs at a local reservoir. In one dramatic moment, Silva was reminded by Conrad that Tsarnaev once told him, ""You don’t want to meet my brother.""

""He said his brother was very strict, very opinionated,"" Silva testified. ""And that since I wasn't a Muslim he might give me a little s*** for that.""

A Cambridge man mentioned in Silva's testimony made an appearance at the same federal courthouse in Boston today. Merhawi ""Howie"" Berhe was indicted last week on federal charges relating to the possession of the Ruger P95 handgun later used by the Tsarnaev brothers, according to the indictment.

Berhe, Silva testified today, gave him the gun because ""his mother had searched his room and he needed to get it out of his house."" Silva described using the gun to rip off two men in Cambridge, and said he brought it to a New Year's Eve party in Medford in 2012 before he lent it to Tsarnaev.

Berhe appeared for a detention hearing today at the same time Silva was taking the stand in the bombing trial. Berhe was freed on bail and his lawyer told ABC News he could not discuss his client's case, except to say that Berhe had been released ""with conditions.""

In Tsarnaev's trial, a new picture was also introduced at the trial showing the Tsarnaev posing under a black flag with white and black Arabic writing. Similar flags have sometimes been associated with jihad, but this has not been independently confirmed by ABC News.

The prosecution claimed the flag hung in Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's bedroom.

Earlier in the today's trial, a Massachusetts man recounted the terrifying moment he realized the Tsarnaev was hiding in a boat in his backyard.

David Henneberry testified that he ""kept fixating"" on a pool of blood that he discovered on the deck of his boat, the ""Slipaway II,"" that was in his backyard.

The retiree testified that he checked on the boat after two chafing guards and the shrink wrap had fallen off the boat.

""Not a huge amount,"" he said of the blood he saw on the boat deck. ""But enough.""

When he climbed a ladder, he ""saw a body in the boat,"" Henneberry told the court, also describing Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's shoes, pants and hooded sweatshirt.

There was ""no movement at all"" from the figure ""lying on his side,"" he testified.

Tsarnaev had been on the run since a shootout hours earlier with police that left his brother dead and an officer injured, according to prosecutors.

The prosecution also showed pictures of the message that they said Tsarnaev scrawled on to the side of the boat. The prosecution also introduced into evidence the bloodied pencil that authorities said Tsarnaev used.

The message ""Stop killing our innocent people ... we will stop,"" was carved into a wooden slat on the side of the boat. Tsarnaev also scrawled a long message in pencil branded with the name of David Henneberry's stepson's company, according to the prosecution.

Tsarnaev faces the death penalty for his role in the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings that killed three people. Am MIT police officer was killed days later, allegedly by Tsarnaev and his older brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev.

During Monday's court proceedings, a number of police officers described the gunfight between cops and the Tsarnaev brothers and the ensuing struggle with Tamerlan Tsarnaev. They also testified that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev sped in an SUV toward the struggle, ultimately running over his older brother.

Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has pleaded not guilty to the 30 counts against him, including charges of using a ""weapon of mass destruction resulting in death,"" but his defense attorney has said that he participated in the bombing."
1AbEk7a,2015-02-20 00:00:00,"How to Eat All the Fish You Want, Minus the Mercury Danger - ABC News",http://abcnews.go.com/Health/eat-fish-minus-mercury-danger/story?id=29087459,"Fish: It’s one of the most confusing topics among health-conscious eaters. On one hand, fish is a great source of protein and healthy fat, and eating it has been linked to lower rates of several illnesses, including heart disease and Alzheimer’s. Then again, some types are full of mercury or other pollutants. It seems like one day we’re told to eat less fish, and the next, to eat more.

And in the last few weeks, the news gave us two more reasons to think twice about eating it at all: first, a study hinted at a link between mercury and autoimmune disorders in women. And before that, another report found that mercury contamination of yellowfin tuna (also known as ahi) is growing far faster than previously thought. So, what are we supposed to do?

Keep it on the menu, but do it strategically. In general: “The rule of thumb for seafood is to mix it up. Eat it 2 to 3 times per week, but don’t eat the same type more than 2 to 3 times per month,” explains Timothy Harlan, MD, an internist and editor of Dr. Gourmet.

“With the wide variety of choices you could eat a different type of seafood—shrimp, crab, salmon, scallops, cod, trout, mussels, catfish, tuna, halibut—and not have to repeat the same seafood choice twice in a month.”

This is a helpful strategy because different types of ocean fare contain varying amounts of mercury. So while, say, halibut falls under the “moderate” mercury level category, according to the National Resources Defense Council, eating it in the same week with a low-mercury type (like wild salmon) can help you keep your exposure the the heavy metal under control.

Spacing out intake of higher-mercury fish gives your body a chance to eliminate it before it builds up to dangerous levels. It’s a good idea to save or print the NRDC list of mercury-containing fish, so you always have it on hand.

20 Things You Should Throw Away for Better Health

The trickiest thing about mercury is that the amount of danger depends on so many factors: not only the type of seafood and where it came from, but also what other types of seafood you’re eating and when, plus your body weight. That’s why, if you eat a lot of seafood, it’s not a bad idea to use the NRDC’s mercury calculator to plan your meals.

Another option is to download the Monterey Bay Aquarium’s Seafood Watch app (Free, iTunes or Google Play), which provides up-to-date guidance right from your smartphone. You can search for different types of seafood while you’re in the store or trying to decide what to order at a restaurant. The app will tell you what’s a “Best Choice,” “Good Alternative” or if you should “Avoid,” and it includes a special guide for sushi that decodes the Japanese names for different types of fish.

14 Types of Food That Can Make You Sick

Finally, if you find all of this way too confusing, you can limit your options by eating only from the Monterey Bay Aquarium’s Super Green List, recommended by Health‘s contributing nutrition editor, Cynthia Sass, RD. The five choices on this list—Atlantic mackerel, certain types of salmon (freshwater coho farmed, and wild-caught from Alaska) and Pacific sardines—are guaranteed to deliver 250 milligrams of heart- and brain-healthy omega-3s without worrisome levels of mercury.

1ABieHX,2015-03-18 00:00:00,Tairod Nathan Webster Pugh: Former US Air Force Mechanic Charged With Trying to Join ISIS in Syria - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/International/us-air-force-mechanic-charged-join-isis-syria/story?id=29699712,"A former U.S. Air Force veteran has been arrested by the FBI for allegedly trying to join ISIS, the brutal terrorist group wreaking havoc in Syria and Iraq, after watching their online propaganda videos, authorities announced today.

Tairod Nathan Webster Pugh, 47, who is from New Jersey but had been living overseas for years, was secretly arrested two months ago after being deported back to the United States.

On Jan. 10, he flew from Egypt to Turkey hoping to slip into Syria and ""fight violent jihad"" with ISIS, but Turkish authorities refused to let him enter their country, federal prosecutors say in court documents filed in Brooklyn, N.Y., authorities said.

Egyptian authorities then deported Pugh to the United States, where he was arrested by the FBI and found to be carrying multiple electronic devices, including a cell phone that allegedly contained a photograph of a machine gun. Some of the data on the electronic devices had been deleted, prosecutors say.

On his laptop, FBI agents discovered that he had been viewing ISIS propaganda online and conducting online searches for such phrases as ""borders controlled by Islamic state,"" ""kobani border crossing,"" and ""who controls kobani,"" according to prosecutors.

In addition, the FBI recovered two of Pugh's backpacks, which allegedly contained two compasses, a solar-powered flashlight, a solar-powered power source, a fatigue jacket and camping clothes.

Pugh also allegedly searched online for the ISIS video ""Flames of War,"" a 55-minute piece of propaganda that even the FBI highlighted late last year when asking ""for the public's help identifying individuals who have traveled—or are planning to travel—overseas to engage in combat alongside terrorist organizations.""

A month before his alleged attempt to join ISIS, Pugh was fired from his job as an airplane mechanic in Kuwait, according to court documents. He learned how to install and maintain aircraft engines, navigation systems and weapons systems while serving in the Air Force from 1986 to 1990, the documents say.

According to court documents, he ""appears to have close ties to a woman in Egypt whom he has identified as his wife.""

A federal grand jury in Brooklyn, N.Y. indicted Pugh Monday on two charges -- attempting to provide material support to terror organization, and obstruction and attempted obstruction of an official proceeding.

Over the past 18 months, about 30 people have been charged with joining terrorist groups in Syria and Iraq or trying to do so.

Pugh converted to Islam after moving to San Antonio, Texas, in 1998 and ""became increasingly radical in his beliefs,"" the feds said.

In 2001, while he was working as a mechanic for American Airlines, a coworker notified the FBI that Pugh had been expressing anti-American sentiment and that he sympathized with Osama bin Laden, authorities said.

Pugh will be arraigned before a federal judge on Wednesday. If convicted at trial, Pugh faces a maximum sentence of 35 years in prison.

1AbqVsn,2015-03-09 00:00:00,Marijuana Bales Thrown at Police During High-Speed Chase In Arizona - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/US/marijuana-bales-thrown-police-high-speed-chase-arizona/story?id=29503432,"You'll have to see it to believe it.

Dash-cam footage from a police car in a high-speed chase in Arizona shows bales of marijuana being thrown at it from the window of the suspects' car ahead.

The pursuit, which reached speeds over 100 mph, turned into a short foot chase after the suspects stopped their car and fled, according to a statement on the Pinal County Sheriff's Office's Facebook. However, the two men were successfully stopped and arrested, and police also discovered a stash house in Mesa, AZ, the Pinal County Sheriff's Office said.

""These foreign drug smugglers try to outrun our deputies and even throw bales of marijuana from their vehicle,"" Pinal County Sheriff Paul Babeu said in a statement posted on Facebook. ""We caught these criminals who put our deputies and our local citizens in harm’s way, and now they will go to prison for their crimes.""

About 374 pounds of marijuana were recovered as evidence, the sheriff's office said, adding that not all the thrown pot was found because four or five vehicles not involved in the chase stopped to grab some of the tossed bales before police could get back to them.

The high-speed chase happened last Wednesday morning when a deputy officer was monitoring traffic on a Casa Grande highway, the sheriff's office said.

The officer noticed a 2006 White Trailblazer traveling much faster than the other vehicles on the roadway and attempted to stop the car. The vehicle led multiple police units on a high-speed chase.

The Trailblazer eventually went into the campus of Central Arizona College, where Pinal County Sheriff's deputies ahead of the chase set up spike strips that successfully deflated the Trailblazer's front tires, police said.

""Both occupants, later identified as Mario Perez-Paz (43 of Mexico) and Juan Aguilar-Zavala (21 of Unknown), exited the car and led deputies on a short foot pursuit, but were taken into custody,"" the Pinal County Sheriff's Office said in a statement.

Perez-Paz and Aguilar-Zavala said they were offered $1,000 by a female in Phoenix to drive the Trailblazer to pick up ""unknown packages,"" police said.

Both men were booked into the Pinal County Sheriff’s Jail on multiple drug charges and unlawful flight, police added.

From information developed from an earlier pursuit, Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials said they believe suspected smugglers' destination was a stash house in Mesa, where authorities discovered 20 undocumented immigrants from Guatemala and Mexico.

Babeu used the incident to criticize President Barack Obama's recent actions on immigration.

“This further proves that not only drugs like methamphetamine, cocaine and heroin are being smuggled into America by way of Arizona, but scores of illegals from Central America have never stopped,"" Babeu said. ""Meanwhile, President Obama continues to violate US immigration law and instead prioritizes the needs and concerns of illegals ahead of American citizens. This further undermines the rule of law and our current immigration process that currently allows more foreigners to lawfully immigrate into America every year than every other nation combined."""
1AclLQe,2015-02-21 00:00:00,Exclusive: Saving Hannah Anderson: Inside the Dramatic FBI Rescue of Kidnapped 16-Year-Old - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/US/saving-hannah-anderson-inside-dramatic-fbi-rescue-kidnapped/story?id=29089347,"It was a murder, kidnapping and manhunt that riveted the nation in the summer of 2013, and now ABC News has obtained never-before-seen FBI surveillance video and photos of the rescue of 16-year-old Hannah Anderson.

The video and exclusive new interviews with the FBI agents who commanded the search and rescue sheds new light on Hannah’s captivity, and the week-long manhunt for her kidnapper that stretched from the Mexican border to northern Idaho.

The story began with the discovery of a grisly crime scene in Boulevard, California, on a hot Sunday in August. The home of Anderson family-friend James DiMaggio burned to the ground in a spectacular fire, and in the ashes, two bodies were discovered -- Hannah’s mother, Christina Anderson, and her 8-year brother Ethan. Police say Christina had been bound, gagged and beaten to death. Both bodies were burned beyond recognition. Investigators found evidence in the rubble that led them to believe DiMaggio had killed the two, then set the home on fire to try to cover up the crimes.

Immediately, police and family members feared for Hannah’s safety. She had not been seen since cheerleading practice on Saturday, and she was supposed to get a ride home from that practice from DiMaggio. Authorities issued an Amber Alert, and border agents reported seeing DiMaggio and Hannah Anderson in a Blue Nissan, driving through a checkpoint at the California-Mexico border.

The FBI began to interview anyone close to Hannah or James DiMaggio. Some of Hannah’s friends reported that the 40-year-old DiMaggio had told Hannah he had a “crush” on her, and that “creeped” Hannah out.

But there were text messages between Hannah and DiMaggio. Authorities say the text messages appeared to be innocent and were to arrange for a pickup after cheerleading practice. There were social media questions about the communications, but the FBI said it found disturbing evidence pointing to an abduction by DiMaggio.

“We were finding signs of handcuff boxes and restraints and things at the residence that were indications that she was probably taken against her will,” FBI Deputy Director Britt Johnson told ABC’s Pierre Thomas.

And Johnson said the Bureau felt it was a race against time to find the teenager.

“We were very concerned that something had clicked to cause him to take this terrible course of action. And at this point, I think he’s fully in. There’s no turning back for him.”

Looking for a motive for the murders and kidnapping, investigators cracked open DiMaggio’s computer, and found emails to Hannah that indicated DiMaggio feared Hannah was growing up, and growing away from the man she had always called Uncle Jim.

“Somewhere in his mind, I think he thought that he and Hannah would have a relationship and she would somehow fall in love with him,” Johnson said. “I think the ability for him to get her away and take her somewhere -- he somehow thought he could change the situation.”

In the days after the kidnapping, citizen sightings of DiMaggio’s blue Nissan flooded in to law enforcement agencies, placing the two everywhere from Mexico to Oregon. The FBI learned that DiMaggio had purchased a blue tent and some other camping gear before he kidnapped Hannah. But as the week slipped past, none of those leads panned out, and concern for Hannah’s safety heightened. Johnson said that investigators could only hope that DiMaggio’s attachment to the girl would keep her safe.

“We were waiting on that first lead,” Johnson said, “That big break to point us in the right direction.”

That break finally came when a group of horseback riders in the “River of No Return” wilderness area in Idaho came across a man and a teenage girl who did not look like they belonged there. The riders told the county sheriff the young girl was blond, and was wearing pajama pants and battered sneakers. The older man was carrying a grey house cat. The FBI knew that DiMaggio had kept a grey cat as a pet.

“It was more than a good lead,” Johnson said. “We started directing resources towards that area.”

The problem for law enforcement was that The Frank Church-River of No Return wilderness area is part of the largest road-less tract of land left in the lower 48 states. It is 2.5 million acres of heavily forested mountains, deep ravines, raging rivers and arduous terrain. In other words, it was the perfect place for a kidnapper to hide.

Hundreds of law enforcement officers flooded into a newly-established command center in Cascade, Idaho, and soon, some basic police work paid off. A search of the area turned up DiMaggio’s blue Nissan, covered in brush, near the trailhead ridden by those horseback riders. Anyone hiking that trail was stopped and questioned. Johnson said that the last person who came off the trail on Friday, August 9, said they saw a man and a teenage girl setting up camp high up in the mountains at Morehead Lake.

The U.S. Marshals Service had a small plane at the command center, and early on Saturday, August 10, they got airborne to see if they could spot DiMaggio and Hannah near Morehead Lake. At first, they didn’t see anyone, and were about to turn off, but U.S. Marshal Steve Jurman says they decided to make another pass.

""We circled a few more times and focused in on that area. And then we were able to see that it was a blue tent,"" he said.

And then, he says two people came into focus.

""We were actually able to verify that it was a male and a female with blond hair and a small animal. So, at that point we knew we had something extremely valuable,"" said Jurman.

Once the discovery was made, an FBI plane with more sophisticated surveillance gear got airborne and confirmed it was DiMaggio, Hannah, and a grey cat.

“They relayed that yes, in fact, there was a cat at the campsite and they were tracking the cat, and that was just an extra bit of confirmation,” the FBI’s James Yacone told Pierre Thomas.

Yacone heads up the Bureau’s Critical Incident Response Group, and he launched two hostage rescue teams to try to reach Hannah.

“By 2 p.m., they were boarding a Blackhawk helicopter flown by Customs and Border Patrol, and inserting about three miles away,” Yacone said.

The rescue teams were dropped on a ridge line with an elevation of about 6,500 feet above sea level, and Yacone said it took them nearly three hours to hike the three miles to the lake location.

“There’s nothing out there,” Yacone said. “Radio communications were very, very difficult.”

The aerial surveillance ""eye in the sky"" was also serving as a radio relay transformer, helping to maintain communications and guide the team on the ground.

“Stealth was the key,” Yacone said.

While the rescue team was moving into place, the aerial surveillance saw something remarkable. It was Hannah waving her arms at the sky, as if signaling the plane. She was waving what looked like a white handkerchief, trying to draw attention while DiMaggio was off collecting firewood. On the ground, the FBI hostage rescue team was concealed nearby, waiting for the right moment to strike.

“One of the requirements to move in on the arrest was a distance and a separation between Hannah and DiMaggio,” Yacone pointed out.

But time and light was becoming a factor as well. It was just after 5 p.m., and it was beginning to get dark. Once DiMaggio moved back into the woods to get more fuel for the campfire, the agents moved in. According to Hannah and the FBI, DiMaggio fired at least one shot. The hostage rescue team opened fire, hitting DiMaggio with five shots and killing him.

“After the shooting occurred, obviously the primary focus was to get to Hannah,” Yacone said. “She was obviously confused about what had just occurred….She’s crying. She was absolutely relieved once she realized this is the FBI and we were here to help her.”

At FBI headquarters in Washington, Assistant Director Britt Johnson was listening to the radio traffic as the hostage rescue team moved in.

“We heard, ‘shots fired’ and we heard ‘one down hard’ and ‘Jackpot.’ When we heard ‘Jackpot’…we knew Hannah was okay.”

At the campsite, another helicopter was brought in to whisk Hannah off to the hospital. Doctors and a team of FBI experts were waiting for her. She didn’t know that her mother and little brother had been killed, and it fell to the FBI team to tell her. The next day, agents brought the grey cat to her, but she refused it. It had been DiMaggio’s, and was eventually returned to his family.

James DiMaggio’s family has indicated it may file suit to discover the details of his death at the hands of the FBI. An investigation of the shooting by Idaho authorities and the FBI ruled the shooting justified.

Reached for comment, Anderson family spokesperson Stacy Hess said in a statement, “In the 18 months since Hannah was returned to her family, she and her dad, Brett Anderson, have been focused on healing from the harrowing events of August 2013. Hannah is a senior in high school who has achieved a 3.8 GPA, and a place on the Honor Roll for all of her junior year and all of her senior year to date. She is exploring colleges now where she plans to study forensics and criminology with a goal of becoming a detective with a Special Victims Unit. The entire Anderson family is eternally grateful to all of the individuals who helped rescue Hannah, and especially to the good men and women of the FBI who have clearly influenced her career aspirations.”

A representative of James DiMaggio’s sister, Lora DiMaggio, said in a statement, ""She is tirelessly pursuing every legal remedy available to her, so she can find out the truth about what happened to her brother, Jim DiMaggio. Lora DiMaggio has no comment regarding what appears to be heavily edited surveillance video released by the FBI to ABC News."""

Can the gold Apple watch hold up its value as well as some other luxury watches do?

Each Apple Watch ""Edition"" will be made of 18-karat gold, which is twice as hard as standard gold, and sapphire crystal, according to Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL).

The Edition smartwatch faces competition from a wide range of ""benchmark"" Swiss watches that can cost $5,000 to $10,000, before competing with the higher-priced, ultra-luxury watches. But unlike these watches, the resale value for old Apple products typically diminishes significantly. For example, older iPhone models are typically sold with deep discounts.

Here are some other sought-after watches that focus on time at similar price points to the 18-karat gold Apple Watch Edition.

1. $8,985: Rolex Submariner

Rolex's Submariner watch can be called either a ""quintessential"" or ""generic"" Rolex, depending on the watch collector's view. Various versions cost anywhere from $7,000 to $10,000. One Submariner with Swiss automatic movement, stainless steel and ""anti-reflective"" sapphire is listed for $8,985 on Amazon.com. Because of the Swiss Rolex brand and ""prestige"" of this watch, it holds value on the resale market much better than most watches, according to this Forbes column.

2. $9,395: Panerai Radiomir

Water resistant to 330 feet with a 47-mm case, this watch is made by Italian watchmaker Panerai and priced at $9,395 on Amazon.com. The company say it combines ""the design and the Italian creativity with Swiss technology.""

3. $10,100: Jaeger-LeCoultre Master Ultra Thin Moon 39

Luxury Swiss watchmaker Jaeger-LeCoultre goes super-narrow with a 4.9-mm thick watch with a ""moon-phase display"" that, you guessed it, shows the phase of the moon. Some collectors appreciate the feature for its utility, where others just appreciate the technical or aesthetic aspect. The sapphire crystal case back reveals the movement of the watch.

4. $10,471: IWC Portuguese Automatic

Priced at $10,470.98 via Amazon, this IWC watch's model year is 2011. Amazon says the stainless steel watch's listing price was $14,100.

5. $10,600: Jaeger-LeCoultre Master Chronograph

With a 40-mm diameter case, the Jaeger-LeCoultre Master Chronograph watch has a convex dial with a ""pulsometer scale.""

The watch, in yellow or rose gold, will be sold on April 24 and available to pre-order on April 10. The Apple Watch will be available first in these nine places: Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, United Kingdom and United States."
1Ad1cTP,2015-02-20 00:00:00,18-Year-Old California 'Superbug' Victim's Three-Month ICU Ordeal - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Health/18-year-california-superbug-victims-month-icu-ordeal/story?id=29102940,"An 18-year-old is among the seven California hospital patients to come down with a deadly drug-resistant ""superbug,"" and he's spent most of the last three months in the intensive care unit, his lawyer told ABC News.

""His prognosis at this time is guarded but optimistic,"" said Pete Kaufman, an attorney for the teen's family.

The teen already had an acute illness when he underwent an endoscopy procedure at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center in December 2014, Kaufman said.

""Shortly after the procedure, he became gravely ill, and it was determined by the physicians at UCLA that he had contracted the CRE infection,"" Kaufman said.

The teen was an inpatient at the hospital for more than two months and spent a ""significant amount of that time"" in the ICU, Kaufman said. He was released, but returned to the hospital for another endoscopy procedure in January, causing him to become re-infected with CRE. He is still an inpatient at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, the lawyer said.

""It's the scope, the procedure that is now thought to have caused him to get the CRE infection,"" Kaufman said, adding that the teen's illness started with a fever and progressively got worse until he was ""gravely, gravely ill.""

Seven people have become infected with the drug-resistant ""superbug"" known as CRE at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center after undergoing endoscopy procedures, and CRE may have played a role in two of its patients' deaths, hospital officials said Wednesday afternoon, adding that 179 people were exposed to the germ.

The scopes were new and had only been in use since June, said Dr. Zachary Rubin, medical director of clinical epidemiology and infection prevention at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center.

""There are several manufacturers for these scopes,"" said Dr. Benjamin Schwartz, deputy chief of the acute communicable disease control program, Los Angeles County Department of Public Health. ""Because of the complexity of these scopes, which is necessary for the life-saving procedures for these scopes, they are very, very difficult to clean.

Only 18-months-old, Hulk weighs a hefty 175 pounds.

Despite his intimidating size, his owners Marlon Grannan and his wife Lisa Grannan say Hulk is a sweet family dog and a best friend to their 3-year-old son Jordan.

Online videos and photos of Hulk with their son in their New Hampshire home shatter misconceptions about Pit Bulls as ruthless monsters.

Grannan's toddler can be seen riding Hulk, singing with him and napping with him.

""He's a wonderful, excellently trained dog,"" Grannan said. ""He plays with my kid, he's great with the family and he's so, so sweet.""

""Because Pit Bulls are only in the media when bad things happen, this myth of them as monsters gets perpetuated,"" Grannan added, ""but it's not true. They might not be for everyone, but under a good leader and with proper training, they make amazing family and work or protection dogs.""

Grannan and his wife are the owners of Dark Dynasty K9s, family-owned kennel that breeds and trains American Pit Bull Terriers as protection dogs for clients worldwide. Dark Dynasty K9s is also a member of the American Dog Breeders Association and the United Kennel Club.

""I want to emphasize that we breed and train dogs who come in stable,"" Grannan said. ""Our goal is to make these dogs fearless for the intimidation factor that protection dogs need to have, not for them to be uncontrolled and maul or bite anyone. That is improper training.""

He owns 12 Pit Bulls in training and one Chihuahua. All of them live and work with him at their 150-acre home and kennel, Grannan said.

And yet, Hulk, the biggest of them all, has garnered the most attention. A video of him being weighed last month had over 7 million views as of Tuesday morning.

""My hope is that we can stop ignorance and change people's minds about Pit Bulls in a positive way with all this attention,"" Grannan said."
1ADDxZv,2015-03-18 00:00:00,Inside the Elton John-Dolce & Gabbana Feud - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/inside-elton-john-dolce-gabbana-feud/story?id=29702355,"The feud between fashion designers Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana and Elton John continues.

The designers are hitting back after John called for a boycott of the Dolce & Gabbana label after Dolce called babies conceived by alternative methods ""synthetic babies.""

""It's an authoritarian way of seeing the world: agree with me or, if you don’t, I'll attack you,"" Gabbana told the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera.

""I even posted the word 'Fascist!' on his Instagram,"" Gabbana said of John, who took offense as the father of two children born via IVF with his partner David Furnish.

Meanwhile, John's campaign seems to be gaining ground with several celebrities, who have joined the boycott.

The singer is no stranger to public feuds, having carried on a decade-long one with Madonna, which finally ended in 2013 with him sending a note of apology to the Material Girl.

His latest feud is just getting started. Here's a quick timeline:

Synthetic Children

It all started after the designers gave an interview to Italy's Panorama magazine published over the weekend. When asked about family and children, Dolce responded:

""We certainly didn’t invent the family. The Sacred Family made it an icon, but irrelevant of religion or social status: you are born and have a father and a mother. Or at least that is how it should be, that is why what I call children of chemistry, synthetic babies, do not convince me. Surrogate mothers (literal translation: rented uteruses), seeds chosen from a catalogue. And then go and explain to these children who their mothers are. Would you accept to be a child of chemistry? Procreation must be an act of love, nowadays even the psychiatrists are not ready to face the effects of these experiments.""

When the pair, who were in a relationship for 20 years, were asked if they wanted to be fathers, Gabbana replied, ""Yes, I would have a son immediately,"" while Dolce responded, ""I am gay, I cannot have children. I don’t believe one can have everything in life, if it isn’t there it means that it cannot be. It is also nice to deprive oneself of something. Life has its natural course, there are things that cannot be changed. And one of these things is the family.""

John Takes Offense

Dolce's statements drew immediate criticism, most notably from John.

""How dare you refer to my beautiful children as 'synthetic,'"" John wrote on his Instagram Sunday, alongside a photo of the designers. ""And shame on you for wagging your judgemental little fingers at IVF - a miracle that has allowed legions of loving people, both straight and gay, to fulfil their dream of having children. Your archaic thinking is out of step with the times, just like your fashions. I shall never wear Dolce and Gabbana ever again. #BoycottDolceGabbana""

Dolce and Gabbana Release Statement

By Monday, the designers had released a statement, clarifying the remarks.

""We firmly believe in democracy and the fundamental principle of freedom of expression that upholds it,"" Gabbana wrote in a statement sent to ABC News. ""We talked about our way of seeing reality, but it was never our intention to judge other people's choices. We do believe in freedom and love.""

Dolce added, ""I'm Sicilian and I grew up in a traditional family, made up of a mother, a father and children. I am very well aware of the fact that there are other types of families and they are as legitimate as the one I've known. But in my personal experience, family had a different configuration. That is the place where I learnt the values of love and family. This is the reality in which I grew up, but it does not imply that I don't understand different ones. I was talking about my personal view, without judging other people's choices and decisions.""

Boycott Bandwagon

But by then, several celebrities had joined the boycott against the designer label, which is popular on red carpets and TV and movie screens.

.@dolcegabbana ur voices R 2powerfull 2B spreading so much h8 http://t.co/30Oe2hcxNt Wake up,Its 2015 Luv urselves guys #boycottdolcegabbana

Just round up all my Dolce & Gabbana pieces, I want to burn them. I'm just beyond words and emotions. Boycott senseless bigotry! #boycottD&G

Right on Elton and David

My D&G shirts are going in the bin- don't want ANYONE to wear them

Designer Victoria Beckham even weighed in, expressing her support for John, who is the godfather to one of her sons.

Sending love to Elton David Zachary Elijah & all the beautiful IVF babies x vb

Gabbana Gives Another Interview

As the boycott seemed to gain ground, Gabbana gave a follow-up interview Monday to Italy's Corriere della Sera, this time taking off the gloves.

""I didn’t expect this, coming from someone whom I considered, and I stress 'considered,' an intelligent person like Elton John,"" Gabbana told the newspaper. ""I mean, you preach understanding, tolerance and then you attack others? Only because someone has a different opinion? Is this a democratic or enlightened way of thinking? This is ignorance, because he ignores the fact that others might have a different opinion and that theirs is as worthy of respect as his.""

Gabbana also clarified his earlier remark to Panorama about wanting to be a father.

""Domenico said that he’d rather have a traditional family. It’s his opinion. He’s not comfortable with IVF. It’s all about his traditional Sicilian upbringing. I have a different opinion. We have mutual respect,"" he told the newspaper.

Asked whether he's worried the boycott will affect the label's sales, he replied with a smile, ""Maybe we’ll lose some Elton John fans, maybe we’ll get some more mums. Who knows.""

Meanwhile, John posted a photo of his sons, Zachary, 4, and Elijah, 2, on Instagram.

""Photo booth fun at yesterday's lunch. #ShareTheLove,"" John wrote Monday."

That's according to baby naming web site Nameberry, who has published a list of names ""on the verge of extinction.""

Other female names about to go the way of the dinosaur? Claudine, Sheba and Sondra, among others.

Nanette peaked in 1956, according to the site. Claudine, the female version of the ancient Roman name Claudius, peaked in 1970 and fell off the charts in 1975.

""Claudine along with most other once-popular –ine and –een-ending girls’ names are now out of favor,"" according to Nameberry.

As for Sondra, it's demise has to do with Hurricane Sandy. It ""took a lot of wind out of all forms of this name, given to only five girls in 2013.""

As for boys' names, did you know the name Elmo didn't originate with the furry red monster? It is the short form of Guglielmo, the Italian form of William, said Nameberry. It disappeared around the 1950s. And where's Waldo? Almost nowhere, it seems. The name was given to just five boys last year, according to Nameberry. It was most popular in 1881, when it ranked 347.

Also given to only five babies last year: Sherwood. ""The stiff surname Sherwood, which does have the distinguished namesake of influential novelist Sherwood Anderson, managed to make it onto the list from 1897 to 1963, peaking at Number 533 in 1938, Anderson’s heyday.""

Danish police shot and killed the 22-year-old man early today in a shootout with police in the Noerrebro district of Copenhagen, Danish investigator Joergen Skov told The Associated Press.

He was believed to be responsible for shootings at a free speech event and a synagogue in Copenhagen that officials said were likely inspired by last month's terror attacks in Paris.

According to Copenhagen police, at about 5 a.m., the suspect was returning to an address that was under police surveillance. When officers tried to make contact with the suspect, he shot at them. The officers returned fire, killing him.

Police said they had found an automatic weapon that may have been the one used in the attack at the free speech event, according to the AP.

""Nothing at this point suggests there were other perpetrators"" in the Saturday shootings, Skov said. Police officials said at a news conference Sunday that they knew who the suspect was but have not yet released his identity, only saying he was from Copenhagen.

The first shooting happened about 4 p.m. Saturday at an event titled ""Art, Blasphemy and Freedom of Expression,"" organized by Swedish artist Lars Vilks, who has faced several threats after caricaturing the Prophet Muhammad.

Vilks told Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet that he ""heard some shots. They sounded weak so I didn't think they sounded as gun shots. It was very surreal.""

""I'm not sure how many shots but I'd say about 20 or 30 shots,"" Dennis Myhoff-Brink, who witnessed the attack, told BBC News. ""People panicked of course and ran to the doors. Other people were hiding behind tables they had turned over.""

The 55-year-old victim in that shooting has been identified as filmmaker Finn Noergaard, a man who produced and directed documentaries for Danish television, according to the AP.

Vilks, 68, who was not injured in the shooting, said he believes he was the intended target.

""What other motive could there be? It's possible it was inspired by Charlie Hebdo,"" he told the AP.

""This is not unexpected ... not going to be the last time either,"" Vilks told Swedish newspaper ""Aftonbladet."" ""It could have been a massacre, what if the suspect would have gotten inside the venue... Of course this is a tragedy but it was expected. It would have happened sooner or later.""

""Denmark has been hit by terror,"" Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt said, according to the AP. ""We do not know the motive for the alleged perpetrator's actions, but we know that there are forces that want to hurt Denmark. They want to rebuke our freedom of speech.""

The shooting happened a month after gunmen opened fire on the Charlie Hebdo satirical magazine in Paris, killing 12 people. The magazine had published cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad, angering many Muslims.

In the days that followed, a police officer was killed and four others slain at a kosher grocery store inside the French capital.

Hours after the shooting at the cafe, police said Dan Uzan, a 37-year-old member of Copenhagen's Jewish community, was killed and two police officers were wounded in a shooting outside a synagogue.

Uzan was standing near the entrance when he was shot, acting as a security guard for a Bat Mitzvah party that was taking place inside, according to Copenhagen's main synagogue.

""It is a very sad morning where we all think of the victims and their relatives,"" Thornin-Schmidt said. ""Two innocent people have lost their lives because of a cynical terror action against Denmark.""

House Intelligence Committee ranking member Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., told ABC News that it's ""too early to tell"" if the shootings in Copenhagen were tied to ISIS or al Qaeda.

""We still don't know. Obviously they [the intelligence community] are working with Danish authorities to try to get to the bottom of -- was there an affiliation with al Qaeda or ISIS? Was this self-radicalization? Was this a copycat of what happened in Paris?"" Schiff said. ""It's still too early to tell.""

Greste left Cairo with his brother on a flight bound for Cyprus, airport authorities told ABC News. They are expected to continue on to Australia.

“We’re ecstatic that Peter has been released and we now ask if the world could respect his privacy, to give him time to appreciate his freedom before he faces the media,"" read a statement from Greste's brother Andrew.

“We’re pleased for Peter and his family that they are to be reunited,"" Mostefa Souag, acting director general of al-Jazeera, said in a statement. ""It has been an incredible and unjustifiable ordeal for them, and they have coped with incredible dignity. Peter’s integrity is not just intact, but has been further enhanced by the fortitude and sacrifice he has shown for his profession of informing the public.""

An Egyptian official told Agence France-Presse that it was a ""presidential decision to deport Peter Greste to Australia.""

The Australian national was jailed for exactly 400 days after being arrested on December 29, 2013. Two other al-Jazeera employees - Mohamed Fahmy, a dual-Canadian citizen, and Baher Mohamad, an Egyptian cameraman - remain behind bars in Egypt.

The Interior Ministry did not provide additional details on reports that Fahmy's release will follow Greste’s.

All three have consistently denied charges they faced, which included spreading false news and collaborating with the Muslim Brotherhood, and maintain they were working as journalists.

“We will not rest until Baher and Mohamed also regain their freedom,"" Souag said. ""The Egyptian authorities have it in their power to finish this properly today, and that is exactly what they must do.”

Greste and Fahmy were handed seven-year sentences, while Mohamad received an additional three years for a bullet found in his possession, which he had picked up at a protest site, according to al-Jazeera.

On January 1, 2015, Egypt's Court of Cassation accepted a retrial, but the three journalists did not appear at the hearing and were not granted bail.

The imprisonment has provoked criticism from press freedom advocates around the world and sparked the online campaign #FreeAJStaff.

The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has helped lead the charge to free the journalists and repeatedly called on President Abdel-Fattah el-Sisi to free all three immediately. According to CPJ, more than 65 journalists have been detained since former President Mohamed Morsi was ousted in July of 2013."

The shooter, who has not been identified, is now in custody, according to police. The suspect was tased before he was arrested, Mesa police spokesman Esteban Flores said.

Flores said there are believed to be five or six different locations where the shooting took place.

Police said six people were shot, one of whom died at the scene.

Another victim remains in critical condition; four others are expected to survive, police said.

A Mesa police spokesman said that they believe the shooting spree began inside a room at a local motel, and that the suspect then shot one person at a nearby bistro before carjacking a vehicle and driving to an apartment complex.

The suspect then broke into an apartment in that complex, shooting one man, before fleeing to a neighboring apartment building and breaking into another apartment and shooting another individual, who is now in critical condition, police said.

""We don't know exactly what happened at the first shooting,"" a Mesa police official said. ""We know there was some type of argument and they possibly knew each other.""

1Agb6W1,2015-02-01 00:00:00,Super Bowl 2015: Tickets Priciest in History - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/sb-xlix-tickets-priciest-history/story?id=28646737,"The two biggest ticket resale sites, StubHub and NFL Ticket Exchange, said the average price of a sold ticket for this year's game was $4,600 and $4,131, respectively.

If those numbers even seem low, it's because most of the tickets sold before Wednesday when the price skyrocketed. By Thursday, it was nearly impossible to find a ticket for under $4,500. Come Saturday, scoring a ticket for less than $7,000 would be a feat.

Prices rose so quickly because brokers sold Super Bowl tickets, as they have in recent years, without having them in hand. In past years, they would rely on the price dropping as it got closer to the game in order to make their margin on the sale. Except this year that didn't happen. So by Thursday, ticket resellers had a choice of either buying a ticket at a loss and giving it to their customer or offering a refund and admit that they never had the tickets.

StubHub spent an undisclosed amount of money to make sure that every customer that bought tickets on the site got into the game, offering a payment plan to the seller to be able to pay them back over time for backing out. Every fan who bought tickets on NFL Ticket Exchange also had a ticket to the game.

Others weren't as lucky. Those who bought tickets through Vivid Seats were given a 200 percent refund per ticket which, for most, wasn't enough to be able to buy a ticket into the stadium because prices never dropped.

Other sites, which offered refunds and an additional percentage on top of it, were making fans who took the deals sign agreements that they would waive the right to sue in the future.

For its part, NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said the league didn't do anything different than what it had done in the past as far as distribution goes.

The league office retains 25.2 percent of the tickets, each participating team gets 17.5 percent, the host Cardinals get 5 percent and the remaining 29 NFL teams get 1.2 percent each.

The face value of the tickets this year ranged from $800 to $1,900."

Eddie Ray Routh showed no reaction in court as the guilty verdict against him was read, The Associated Press reported.

Routh has been on trial for the February 2013 murders of Kyle and Littlefield at a Texas gun range.

The judge instructed the jury of 10 women and two men that they were to consider three possible decisions: guilty, not guilty, or not guilty by reason of insanity.

After they found Routh guilty, Littlefield's mother, Judy Littlefield, thanked reporters ""for being so compassionate"" and added, “We’re so thrilled that we have the verdict that we have tonight.""

State prosecutors have made it clear that they would not be seeking the death penalty in the case, and the sentence for murder is life in prison.

Routh pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity and his attorneys have argued that the former Marine had mental disorders and was in the grips of psychosis when he fatally shot Kyle and Littlefield during a trip to a gun range on Feb. 2, 2013.

During the 9-day trial, the prosecution and the defense have presented dueling testimony from mental health experts about whether Routh was insane when he committed the murders. Under Texas law, even if a person was suffering from a mental illness, they can be found guilty as long as they understood that what they did was wrong."

The weight of the ice left trees sagging and blocking roads, and ice even snapped some power lines in half.

At one point Saturday morning, the entire town of Monterey was without power.

Milder air was moving into the area, with rain in the forecast for Saturday night. However another blast of Arctic air will be moving in later Sunday evening, giving power companies a small window of time before temperatures plummet into the teens Sunday night."

The singer was honored with a Best Original Song nomination for ""I'm Not Gonna Miss You,"" the track at the end of the documentary film ""Glen Campbell: I'll Be Me.""

""It's just so wonderful to have Glen acknowledged like this. He's such a great entertainer, a great singer, and this song is him pouring his soul out about what he's going through,"" his wife, Kim, told ABC News. ""It's a song that speaks to me. In my mind, it's like him saying, 'Don't worry about me.' It's sad, but it's also comforting.""

Campbell, 71, was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 2011 and now lives in a care facility. His wife said that these days, the singer is doing very well physically but cognitively, he's declined ""quite a bit.""

""He's lost most of his ability to communicate but he can say short phrases like, 'I love you.' He likes to strum on the guitar a bit, and he still prays -- God and his faith have always been important to him,"" she said. ""He's got a heart of gratitude and a positive attitude. ... He's cheerful and content.""

However, though she told him about the nomination, it doesn't seem like he understood what it meant.

""I think maybe if I put one in his hands [he would understand],"" she said. ""If he could just hold it. I hope it happens.""

But whether he wins or loses, she's excited to attend the show with their daughter, Ashley, who also appears in the film, on his behalf and watch their old friend Tim McGraw take the stage to perform the song. However, for her, the night won't be about rubbing elbows with stars: She's also hoping that the nomination helps to raise awareness about Alzheimer's disease.

""Our film and 'Still Alice' and others like that are starting a national conversation that needs to be had,"" she said. ""Everywhere we go people come up to us and say when they watch the documentary, their story is being told."""

At least 27 people out of 300 tested at Olathe Northwest High School in Olathe, Kansas, were positive for the infection, according to a statement from the Johnson County Department of Health and Environment.

The testing started after an active case of tuberculosis was reported on March 5, according to the local health department.

“The number of individuals with TB infection does not exceed what we would anticipate in this setting,” Lougene Marsh, director of the Johnson County Department of Health and Environment, said in a statement. “Of course, we had hoped we wouldn’t find any additional TB cases, but we knew this was a possibility.”

The 27 infected do not have active tuberculosis, meaning they are not contagious. They do not feel sick and do not have tuberculosis symptoms, according to Marsh. Not everyone with a latent tuberculosis infection will get an active infection, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Students and staff will also have a second round of testing in May, since it can take eight weeks for TB bacteria to show up in testing.

Tuberculosis is caused by a bacteria called mycobacterium tuberculosis, which normally attacks the lungs but can also attack the kidneys, spine and brain, according to the CDC. It's normally spread when a person with an active infection coughs or sneezes in the air and the bacteria particles are breathed in by someone nearby.

While a latent TB infection is usually treated with antibiotics, those with an active infection can face six to nine months of medication, according to the CDC.

Calls to Olathe Northwest High School were not immediately returned."

The trio was arrested in December, at which time the Department of Justice described in a statement how the suspects allegedly had unwittingly attempted to unload their deadly wares on confidential sources working with the Drug Enforcement Agency. The suspects believed the weapons were going to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), a U.S.-designated terrorist organization, the DOJ said.

“[The suspects] agreed to provide these weapons to the [DEA’s confidential sources] with the specific understanding that the weapons would be used to kill Americans and, in particular, to shoot down American helicopters and airplanes,” the DOJ statement said.

“As alleged, these three men were ready and willing merchants of death, poised to sell sophisticated weapons to a terrorist organization,” U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said in statement today.

The Justice Department said the three – two alleged weapons brokers based in Romania and one in Greece – were spirited to the U.S. from Montenegro Wednesday and are expected to appear in court later today.

Henry Gevorgyan turned himself in to Los Angeles police late Saturday. Police say he was one of the drivers involved in a fatal crash that was the ""result of an illegal street race"" in the Chatsworth neighborhood of the city on Thursday.

During the race, police say Gevorgyan, 21, lost control of his Ford Mustang and drove into a crowd of about 60 people, killing two and injuring others.

Police said that the Mustang was modified to race, and that the tire marks indicated that Gevorgyan accelerated too quickly and may have lost control when he was shifting gears.

""Street racing, all too often, is publicized as glamorous entertainment,"" Los Angeles Police Captain John McMahon said Thursday. ""Here's a case where street racing is criminal, dangerous, and unfortunately this morning, we see it's deadly.""

Gevorgyan did not have an attorney, according to jail records. Bail was set at $2 million.

The Zasyadko coal mine was the site of one of Ukraine's deadliest mining disasters, a 2007 accident in which more than 100 people died. Since the fall of the Soviet Union, about 250 miners are believed to have died in accidents and explosions there.

Donetsk has been shelled in the last nine months in fighting between Ukrainian government forces and pro-Russian rebels, but an emergency ministry official told ABC News that there was no fighting in the area since an internationally–sponsored ceasefire agreement came into effect in recent weeks.

""It was not due to artillery shelling, it was most likely a gas-air explosion,"" rescue services official Yuliana Bedilo said.

The conflict in eastern Ukraine has, to date, killed more than 6,000 people.

The rebel-held cities of Donetsk and Lugansk are located in coal-rich region of Donbass. The local economy is mainly coal mining or black metallurgy. A local soccer club is called Shaktar, a word for a miner in Ukrainian."

“We’re all going to come face to face with unbearable grief, loss and pain caused by a series of senseless, horribly misguided acts carried out by two brothers, 26-year-old Tamerlan Tsarnaev and his younger brother, 19-year-old Dzhokhar,” defense attorney Judy Clarke told the court. “We do not and will not at any point in this case sidestep or attempt to sidestep Dzhokhar’s responsibility for his actions. We think the question of ‘why’ is important.”

Clarke said it was that facet, the motive behind the deadly bombing, where the defense disagrees with the prosecution. Tamerlan Tsarnaev, Clarke said, was the one “who self-radicalized” and the defense plans to show evidence that Dzhokhar was “enlisted” by his older brother. The defense team gave a hint of a similar potential strategy a year ago when they filed motions to obtain information the attorneys believed would show that between the brothers, Tamerlan was an “all-powerful force who could not be ignored or disobeyed.”

Earlier today U.S. District Judge George O'Toole seemed to strike a blow to such a defense, telling the court that whether Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is more or less culpable than his late brother is not relevant.

Dzhokhar has pleaded not guilty to the 30 counts against him, including charges of using a “weapon of mass destruction resulting in death.” He watched impassively, at times rubbing his stubble and goatee, as the pain of his horrific crimes was described to the jury during the prosecution's opening remarks.

The trial comes just under two years after twin explosions ripped through the crowd near the finish line of the Boston Marathon in April 2013, killing three people – including an eight-year-old boy – and injuring some 260 others. More than a dozen of those injured lost limbs.

Prosecutors say Dzhokhar and his older brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev were responsible for the death and destruction, and that the two were photographed dropping backpacks holding the bombs before the blasts. The city of Boston was paralyzed for days during an intense manhunt, during which the pair allegedly gunned down an MIT police officer.

Tamerlan was eventually killed in a shootout with police days after the attack in the Boston suburb of Watertown.

Dzhokhar was caught hours later, bloody and hiding in a dry-docked boat. While hiding, Tsarnaev penned an anti-American missive on the wall of the boat, saying, ""The U.S. government is killing our innocent civilians, but most of you already know that.”

""We Muslims are one body. You kill one of us, you hurt [unintelligible] us all,” another section of the note read.

After opening statements, the prosecution will immediately force jurors to relive the emotional pain of the marathon attack. The first three dozen witnesses are expected to be bombing victims: amputees and others who were maimed along with the father of Martin Richard, the eight-year-old killed when Dzhokhar Tsarnaev allegedly planted a backpack containing a pressure cooker bomb at the boy’s feet. Their testimony will be followed by others impacted by the blasts, including Marathon organizers and business owners along Boylston Street where the finish line was.

Many survivors of the bombing are watching the proceedings on television from a separate, nearby courtroom.

Stories of Terror From the Finish Line

One of the first witnesses called by the prosecution, Shane O’Hara, managed the Marathon Sports store near the blasts. The court was shown video of panic inside the store after the explosions when people streamed inside seeking shelter.

O’Hara testified that people were trying to attend to the injured, using the store’s merchandise as makeshift tourniquets.

“The thing that haunts me is making decision is who needed help first, who needed help more,” O’Hara said.

Later the court was shown graphic video of the immediate aftermath of the explosions, filmed by the third witness called, Colton Kilgore. Kilgore’s mother-in-law was running the marathon and when the bombs detonated, he said he was “blown through the air.”

Kilgore testified there was smoke and shrapnel and what he described as an “acrid, disgusting smell.”

Next was wrenching, visceral testimony from Sydney Corcoran, a 19-year-old of Lowell, Mass. who was 17 and a high school senior when she attended her first marathon to see her aunt run. She was near the finish line only briefly before “everything went up in smoke.”

""I remember having my mom to the right of me and she was so happy for my aunt that she was just trying to get any type of view. My dad was a little bit behind us to our left. We're just waiting for her to cross and next thing I know we're immersed in smoke and our ears, it's like leaving a concert and having a ringing in your ears and everything is muffled,” she said.

“I immediately lost my family even though they were probably feet away from me I couldn't see them. I didn't know that I was injured. I remember feeling like half of my right foot was gone. I remember trying to put pressure on it and I started to limp. I managed to limp over to a rail and I grabbed onto the rail and passed out for maybe a minute,” she said. “Next thing I know I'm lying flat on my back and there are these men putting mass amounts of pressure on my thigh. They're tying tourniquets to my thigh. I can remember putting his forehead to mine and telling me that I was going to be okay.”

“I was getting increasingly cold and I knew I was dying and I remember having moments of panic and seeing carnage and blood on the street. I had no idea what had happened I just knew it was bad. I remember thinking how can this be real, everything was so happy a few moments ago,” she said.

Another witness for the prosecution, Rebecca Gregory, a tourist from Houston, was celebrating her birthday in Boston with son Noah, 5 on the day of the race. She and her son were cheering on family member near finish line when the first bomb went off.

“I looked down and I couldn’t see my legs. My bones were literally on the sidewalk next to me. I thought that was that day I would die,"" she told the court.

So far, the defense has declined to cross examine the government’s witnesses.

Tamerlan Tsarnaev's Widow Under Investigation

While prosecutors focus today on Dzhokhar, authorities told ABC News they’re also investigating whether Tamerlan’s wife, Katherine Russell, knew of the deadly plot beforehand.

Russell is suspected of being the woman who accompanied Tsarnaev to a Macy’s in Boston two months before the April 2013 attack where he bought five pressure cookers – two of which were allegedly used to make the bombs placed at the marathon finish line. In an affidavit to search the Tsarnaev’s home, FBI agents said they were looking for clothing consistent with those seen on a security video at Macy’s.

Lawyers for Russell and federal prosecutors initially declined to answer ABC News questions about Russell’s status, but a senior law enforcement official said she could face charges of misprision of a felony, or failing to notify authorities of a crime about to happen.

Following Tuesday’s ABC News report on Russell, an attorney for Russell, Joshua Dratel, said in a written statement to ABC News, “There is no video of Ms. Russell at a Macy’s in connection with the purchase of pressure cookers, and any claim that there is such a video, or any claim remotely approaching that, is false. Also false is any allegation that Ms. Russell was involved in the purchase of any pressure cookers, or that she accompanied her late husband with respect to any such purchase by him.”

Days after Tamerlan was identified as one of the suspected bombers, another of Russell’s attorneys at the time, released a statement saying Russell was assisting the investigation into the bombing and was not aware of the plot beforehand.

“As a mother, a sister, a daughter, a wife, Katie deeply mourns the pain and loss to innocent victims, students, law enforcement officers, families and our community,” the attorney, Miriam Weizenbaum, said then.

[This report was updated March 5, 2015 to include a statement from an attorney for Russell.]

While the moon, which orbits Jupiter, has long been suspected to contain water, the Hubble Space Telescope has found compelling evidence of a vast salt water ocean beneath the moon's icy surface, the space agency said.

Ganymede is the only moon in the solar system known to have its own magnetic field, and that magnetic field creates ribbons of glowing electrified gas, like the aurora on Earth. Scientists observed that when Jupiter's magnetic field changes, Ganymede's glowing ribbons of gas also changed -- rocking back and forth.

The changes in the aurorae allowed scientists to determine that a large amount of water is beneath Ganymede's surface affecting the moon's magnetic field.

""If you observe the aurorae in an appropriate way, you learn something about the magnetic field. If you know the magnetic field, then you know something about the moon’s interior,"" Joachim Saur, a co-author of the study, said in a statement.

The ocean is believed to be buried under 95 miles of ice. Scientists estimated the ocean is 60 miles thick, making Ganymede's ocean ten times deeper than any ocean found on Earth, even though Ganymede itself has a radius that is about four-tenths that of the Earth.

Perhaps most exciting of all -- the discovery hints at the possibility that there could be a home for life beyond Earth."
1AjifPq,2015-02-27 00:00:00,See the Home Display That Has Neighbors Riled Up - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/US/swastikas-california-home-neighbors-riled/story?id=29276881,"Is a swastika-laden yard display at a Sacramento, California, house “vulgar” or is it an expression of free speech?

The display, which first started going up months ago, now features an army-green figure raising its arms, a Palestinian flag, and -- in a recent addition -- American and Israeli flags altered by swastikas, according to ABC News station KXTV. At night, it gets illuminated by Christmas lights.

The people listed as the owners of the home did not respond to a request for comment from ABC News. It was not clear that the owners also occupied the home. The occupant did not speak to KXTV or other media outlets, and a note on the door asked for privacy, the Associated Press reported.

There has been at least one small demonstration at the site, and now protesters have been joined in their outrage by a state legislator.

“Swastikas displayed on a house in the River Park section of Sacramento tarnish the neighborhood,"" State Sen. Marty Block, chairman of the California Legislative Jewish Caucus, said in a news conference Thursday, ""and disrespect and dishonor the memory of tens of thousands of brave American soldiers ... men and women who died for their country fighting Hitler's henchmen who wore that very same symbol.""

Block, D-San Diego, said that while he recognizes the ""cherished"" freedom of speech, “My colleagues and I call on the owner of that house to voluntarily remove his vulgar display.""

Robert Roehrs, a neighbor who lives four houses away, said the neighborhood is otherwise a ""very, very, quiet"" suburb.

""I certainly don’t approve of [the display] and I don’t know who he is,"" Roehrs told ABC News, adding that he first thought the display was part of Christmas decorations.

Roehrs, who has lived in his home since 1968, said he doesn't know the identity of the resident, who has moved around some of the items over time.

""I think the guy accomplished what he wanted to accomplish, in my opinion,"" Roehrs said. ""He got a lot of publicity and a lot of notoriety. He hasn’t talked to anyone, apparently. We had a lot of traffic around here. Normally, we don’t get more than two or three cars an hour."""
1AjnDBV,2015-02-27 00:00:00,Google Reveals Plan for Futuristic New Headquarters - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/google-reveals-plan-futuristic-headquarters/story?id=29281704,"Google revealed today plans to trade in its nondescript Mountain View, California, headquarters for a proposed new office worthy of a big budget Hollywood science fiction film.

The plan, which was created by Danish architect Bjarke Ingels at BIG and Thomas Heatherwick at Heatherwick Studio in London, includes glass canopies to allow light and air into the buildings.

The plans for developing the North Bayshore area were submitted today to the Mountain View city council for consideration and were posted online, alongside a nearly ten-minute video detailing the project.

Only a futuristic multi-billion dollar company like Google would consider being able to physically move a building -- but it's one of the cornerstones of the project.

Under the glass canopies, lightweight block-like structures that comprise rooms can be re-arranged like pieces of furniture, allowing Google to seamlessly adjust to its staffing needs.

While the buildings will increase Google's office square footage, the plan is to also open the campus up to the community to create a lively neighborhood feel with retail, restaurants and bicycle paths.

""We're really making sure that we make spaces very open and accessible so it's just not for Googlers, but it's for anyone who lives in the area to come by,"" David Radcliffe of Google said in the video.

Mountain View City Councilman Lenny Siegel told ABC News he is concerned about the traffic flow in Mountain View and the housing supply -- two factors he will have to consider as he evaluates Google's plan.

""Having wonderful new buildings with lots of well-paid employees sounds great, but it effects our housing supply and transportation,"" he said.

It will likely take more than one year for the proposal to be evaluated and approved and it was unclear how long it would take to make Google's dream office space a reality.

One thing is for certain, though: Google has come a long way since it started in a garage."

Would I be happy working for this person?

""I will only hire someone to work directly for me if I would work for that person,"" Zuckerberg told a group in Barcelona who participated in the Facebook co-founder's monthly town hall meeting. ""It's a pretty good test.""

One of those people who passed the test was clearly Facebook's Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg.

When asked by a woman in the audience what it is like to work with Sandberg, Zuckerberg said he considered her a mentor and someone who has been instrumental in building Facebook into a business and ""healthy organization.""

Zuckerberg was in Barcelona for the Mobile World Congress where he spoke about the strides his Internet.org initiative has made in the developing world since he first announced its launch on year ago.

More than 7 million people in developing countries have benefited so far from having Internet access from their phones, according to Zuckerberg. With 50 million people living in the countries that are covered by the app, that number is likely to increase."
1AKclMb,2015-03-01 00:00:00,"Secret Service Working to 'Regain the Trust of the American People,' Says Director - ABC News",http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/secret-service-working-regain-trust-american-people-director/story?id=29278725,"The new head of the Secret Service has this piece of advice for anyone thinking about trying to breach White House security: Don’t.

“I wouldn’t suggest it,” Secret Service director Joseph Clancy told ABC News in an expansive sit-down interview that explored the scandals that have rocked his agency and the path he’s now charting to protect the First Family and “regain the trust of the American people.”

“We have not received an unfair rap,” he conceded to ABC News’ Pierre Thomas. “I think when you fail, and we have failed, we own it. Now, it’s up to us to correct it.”

At the time those scandals and others unfolded, Clancy was the head of security for Comcast, having left the government in 2011 after 27 years with the Secret Service. Clancy was “shocked” by what happened, he said.

Then, last month, a small drone flew over the fence and crashed on the White House grounds - prompting a pre-dawn security scare. President Obama was in India at the time, and although the incident turned out to be a recreational flight gone awry, Clancy said he's “certainly concerned” about the threat a drone like that could pose.

The newly-appointed Secret Service director was with President Obama in India, and the president “was very concerned, as he should be” about the breach, said Clancy, who found himself briefing the commander-in-chief on the matter.

""He wanted to know what happened,"" and he ""had very specific questions,"" Clancy recalled. ""But he has faith in the work that we’re doing.""

Clancy said the Secret Service and other federal agencies “have been doing a lot of research” to develop countermeasures related to drones. He declined to discuss specific ones already in place.

In retrospect, Clancy said, the poor judgment in Cartagena and the failures at the White House five months ago came down to one thing: “Just a lack of self-discipline.”

He dismissed suggestions the high-profile scandals were the product of a culture within the Secret Service that condones poor behavior. He said he “can certainly respect” such claims but insisted the only culture at the Secret Service is quite a different one.

As an example, he pointed to a recent trip he took with President Obama to China, Burma and Australia. An agent became so sick that he had to be hospitalized, but when Clancy visited the agent at the hospital, one of the first things the agent said was, “Sir, I’m sorry I’m out of the mix. I’m sorry I’m not there to pick up my post there,” Clancy recalled.

“That’s the culture that we have,” said Clancy. “Nobody wants to let the agency down, the president down, or the American people. Most importantly, we don’t want to let the American people down.”

Clancy said the more time he spends leading the Secret Service, the more he realizes an insider like himself is the only one who could get that job done.

Two months ago, a bipartisan, independent panel commissioned by the Obama administration to analyze the embattled agency recommended someone with no experience inside the Secret Service, saying “only a director from outside” can “do the honest top-to-bottom reassessment” needed.

“You need some experience in this position,” Clancy told ABC News, adding he plans to win over skeptics.

Clancy said he has three changes in mind to help make that happen: Hire more people, improve training, and raise the fence around the White House.

“We’ve got to do a better job of mentoring, coaching, teaching, and training our people,” he said. “[And] if we can build up our staffing, it will allow us to get more people out to training. With that, as we get more people trained, it’ll help our morale.”

As for the fence, Clancy said he is “very anxious” to make it taller, but that is “a long-term process.” So in the meantime, the Secret Service is planning to implement a series of interim enhancements, including “additional features” atop the fence, according to Clancy.

Those changes will be in place in the “near future,” he said, without offering any more details about the planned enhancements.

The need for a taller fence and better training is only growing, Clancy indicated. In recent years, the Secret Service has seen what he called “a large number” of people, many with some form of mental illness, coming to the White House or Capitol looking to air their grievances.

“That's where our people have to be so well-trained,” he said. “You have to be able to distinguish those that have some mental illness and need help, and those who really have a desire to cause harm. So our people have to show great restraint, but also a great expertise in how to handle these.”

Furthermore, the Secret Service has some big assignments coming up in the next year – Pope Francis is expected to visit as many as three U.S. cities in September, the following month about 190 heads of state will come to New York to celebrate the United Nations’ seventieth anniversary, and then the 2016 presidential race gets underway.

“It’s going to be a huge challenge for us,” Clancy said. “But we have had these challenges before … Our people will be very busy during that time frame, but we’re up to the challenge.”

Clancy became acting director of the Secret Service in October. President Obama officially appointed him as the Secret Service’s 24th director a little over a week ago.

“I think we’re on the right track,” he said."
1AkDgdM,2015-03-15 00:00:00,Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s Birthday: 10 Gifts to Get the 'Notorious' Supreme Court Justice - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/ruth-bader-ginsburgs-birthday-10-gifts-notorious-supreme/story?id=29615773,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the oldest sitting Supreme Court Justice, turns 82 Sunday.

To borrow the words of the late rapper Biggie Smalls, who inspired Ginsburg’s “Notorious R.B.G.” nickname, if you don’t know, now you know.

Appointed by President Bill Clinton in 1993, Ginsburg is the second woman justice in U.S. history and, as Reuters reported, she has no plans to retire anytime soon, despite some calls for her to step down.

To celebrate, here are 10 things (some farfetched, others easy to get your hands on) that “Notorious R.B.G.” might love for her birthday:

“Play on?” Try rule on.

The women of the Supreme Court now exist in LEGO form, thanks to writer Maia Weinstock, who said she hoped the toys would “encourage women to work toward high positions in the U.S. judicial system.”

Unfortunately for SCOTUS-loving parents everywhere, when Weinstock tried entering her collection into a Lego Ideas contest, the company rejected the design, citing a policy against political-themed sets, according to Time.

Can you tell which one’s Ruth Ginsburg?

Justice Ginsburg seems to love adding flair to the justices’ otherwise bland black robes, so what better gift to give than the hallmark of her wardrobe?

She has a large collar collection ranging from all over the world, from places like Metropolitan Opera gift shop and Cape Town, South Africa. A justice can never have enough jabots (collars).

An opera enthusiast, Ginsburg has attended the opera numerous times and even starred in two Washington Opera productions, playing herself in a 2003 production of ""Die Fledermaus"" and as an extra in a 1994 production of ""Ariadne auf Naxos.""

She already has tickets to go see the opera “Scalia/Ginsburg” - a one-act comic opera inspired by the two justices’ opinions and friendship - this summer.

Playing up her “notorious” reputation, Ginsburg revealed that she “wasn’t 100 percent sober” at this year’s State of the Union.

According to Ginsburg, the Supreme Court justices decided to pre-game Obama’s address with some wine at dinner.

""Before we went to the State of the Union, Justice Kennedy brought in...it was an Opus something or other, very fine California wine, and I vowed this year, just sparkling water, stay away from the wine,"" Ginsburg reportedly said. ""But in the end, the dinner was so delicious, it needed wine.""

She was caught dozing off during Obama’s speech.

“If there was one decision I would overrule, it would be Citizens United,” Ginsburg told The New Republic.

“I think the notion that we have all the democracy that money can buy strays so far from what our democracy is supposed to be.”

OK, so it’s not quite a feasible gift, but maybe that’s what Ginsburg will be wishing for as she blows out the candles on her birthday cake.

In the 2014 case Burwell vs. Hobby Lobby, in which the court ruled that corporations with religious beliefs do not have to provide free contraceptives to their employees, Ginsburg wrote one of her more famous dissents.

“The exemption sought by Hobby Lobby and Conestoga would override significant interests of the corporations’ employees and covered dependents,” Ginsburg wrote. “It would deny legions of women who do not hold their employers’ beliefs access to contraceptive coverage that the ACA would otherwise secure.”

Thanks to Bluewater Productions, you can read the life and times of Ruth Bader Ginsburg in comic form as part of the company’s “Female Force” comic book series.

Fellow Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor also has a comic book about her life in the series.

The law journal “Green Bag” has been making bobbleheads of Supreme Court Justices since 2003 and, in 2012, the journal made Ginsburg immortal in bobblehead form.

The tiny toy has features that symbolize big moments in her judicial career. The book she is standing on is Volume 518 of United States Reports, in which her landmark decision in the case U.S. v. Virginia (she struck down the all-male admissions policy at Virginia Military Institute) was published. In her right hand, Ginsburg is clutching a plug she's pulling from a safe representing the 2007 case Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. on which she wrote a famous dissent.

Ginsburg embraces her nickname and even owns a few of Notorious R.B.G. T-shirts that her fans created.

She revealed to NPR’s Nina Totenberg that she didn’t understand the parody behind her nickname at first, and that now she has ""quite a large supply"" of the T-shirts.

“I try to keep abreast of the latest that’s on the Tumblr,” said Ginsburg, who’s a fan of the Tumblr Notorious R.B.G. dedicated to all things Ginsburg, NPR reports.

The blog announced earlier this year that it would pull together components of the blog for a “short and lively biography” titled “R.B.G.: The Life and Times of Ruth Bader Ginsburg,” set to be released in October."
1AKFozt,2015-02-17 00:00:00,Inside a Northern India Temple Where Women Are Exorcized to Tame Their 'Ghosts' - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/International/inside-northern-india-temple-women-exorcized-tame-ghosts/story?id=27882522,"Screams rang out from the temple of Guru Deoji in Northern India. It was the sounds of a woman who seemed to be begging for mercy.

The woman, believed by her husband to be possessed by demons, was undergoing an exorcism. And she is far from being the only one.

Locals in Malajpur, India, where the temple is located, say thousands of women have been brought to the temple by their husbands or family members over the years to submit to a reclusive guru and his disciples who claim to drive off demons and restore sanity for a fee. Exorcisms can involve the women being shouted at, their hair pulled and even beaten. ABC News' ""Nightline"" obtained a video that captured an exorcism ritual at the temple in which women were beaten with a broom.

To get rid of ghosts, rural India has traditionally relied on gurus claiming to have supernatural powers who the husbands or family of the possessed pay in exchange to have their loved ones exorcized.

V.B. Rawat, an activist and author who has written about social development in India, said it’s all a sham.

“It is an attempt to keep people subjugated for years in the name of tradition, in the name of religion, so they do not question the wrongs done to them,” Rawat said.

Most often, he said, it’s the women who are wronged. “These kinds of things are used against women ... A woman can easily be declared as a witch.”

Rawat is a so-called “rationalist,” meaning someone who works to expose “black magic,” and it’s dangerous work in India. Last year, a rationalist named Narenda Dabholkar was shot twice in the head at close range on his morning walk by two assailants on a motorcycle, according to the Times of India. Dabholkar was mobilizing public support for a new law against superstition in the state legislature at the time.

“Nightline” set out on a journey with Rawat to Guru Deoji’s temple in Malajpur to see what was going on.

While at the temple, a woman named Krishna said she had lived there for one year because her husband believes she is possessed. He said he believes his wife’s own ghost abuses her and won’t let her have a son.

“She gets aggressive, she can’t speak,” her husband said in Hindi.

During an exorcism by the guru, Krishna’s eyes went wild, her body slacked, but it was over quickly.

When the guru finally agreed to talk to “Nightline” on the second day, he said through a translator that the “temple heals,” not him, and he is more of a caretaker who channels the powers of gurus before him. He also claimed that women he performed exorcisms on later gave birth to sons.

But on that day, a group of rationalists arrived, saying they were there to stage an intervention on the guru and expose him as a fraud. The guru refused to perform any exorcisms until the group left. Within minutes, the temple was shut down and the doors closed.

On the third day, “Nightline” was allowed back as the only outsiders in the temple. Inside, men and women separated and the chanting began as the guru’s disciples prepared the exorcism on women ready to submit.

“People who will watch her will say it is the ghost who is beaten up, not the woman. The problem is it is the woman who is beaten up,” Rawat said. “I call it a celebration of ignorance.”

One after the other, women approached and bowed down before the temple’s alter, as they were shouted at and had their hair pulled. All the while, one of the guru’s disciples demanded demons leave the women’s bodies. It was a frantic, desperate scene. But Krishna said she will keep coming back until she is certain her demon is gone."

The news of his renewed deal comes two days after Still reported progress in his 4-year-old daughter Leah's fight with a rare pediatric cancer.

His agent, Drew Rosenhaus, tweeted out the news before the team later confirmed the move.

""It's great to have Devon back with us,"" Bengals coach Marvin Lewis said in a statement. ""We know it has been a very difficult journey for him the last year. Devon remains focused on Leah's recovery and on furthering his NFL career, and we're excited to be able to provide that opportunity.""

Still was scheduled to be a Bengals restricted free agent, but the team declined to extend him a restricted free-agent tender on March 10 and instead offered him a one-year contract that had to be worth less than $1.54 million low-round tender he would have been inked to as a restricted free agent. In doing that, the Bengals formally made Still an unrestricted free agent, giving him the option to talk with other teams. While he mulled the Bengals' offer, Still had to determine what best aligned with his daughter's well-being.

""Now that it looks like things are headed on the right path, I'm ready to go back and play football,"" Still said in the team's statement.

Leah became part of one of sports' feel-good stories last fall. In September, her father made national headlines when he was added to the Bengals' 53-man roster after having been originally cut by the team at the end of training camp. Days after he was cut, Still -- a Bengals 2012 second-round pick -- was signed to Cincinnati's practice squad. He only spent one week there before being activated to the 53-man roster in Week 2. He went on to play 12 games last season, collecting 19 tackles.

When they signed him to the practice squad, the Bengals could continue to provide health insurance for Still, giving him the ability to have Leah's medical care completely paid for. At the time, he had been told that her medical expenses would cost close to $1 million.

Leah was diagnosed in June with Stage 4 neuroblastoma, a disease that doctors originally said gave her a 50-50 chance of surviving.

After she underwent surgeries to remove a cancerous tumor from her stomach, and going through rounds of chemotherapy and stem-cell treatments, her prognosis has improved dramatically. On Tuesday, Still announced via Instagram that doctors didn't ""see any active disease"" in Leah's body.

""We still have to wait for her MRI and bone biopsy results later this week,"" Still wrote in the caption of a picture showing him and Leah flexing their muscles.

Still has reiterated that doctors haven't yet said she's cancer-free, but they ""feel very optimistic"" that that could soon be the case."

A team including TV host Jeff Corwin and veterinarian Nantarika Chansue caught and released a giant stingray in Thailand's Mae Klong River that's estimated to weigh between 700 and 800 pounds, according to National Geographic.

The stingray measured over 14 feet long and over 8 feet wide, according to Corwin's Facebook page.

But the animal's exact weight couldn't be recorded last week because it was so big, National Geographic reported, and it's unknown whether it will break the world record for largest freshwater fish.

The stingray ""is doing well and thriving,"" Corwin said on Facebook, and will be featured in an upcoming episode of Corwin's ABC show ""Ocean Mysteries."""

There are now 102 people in 14 states who have become infected with the extremely contagious virus that is considered vaccine-preventable, according to the CDC. Most, but not all cases, have been linked to several dozen people who were exposed to the measles at Disneyland in Anaheim, California, and were not vaccinated.

Of the 34 people for whom the California Department of Public Health had vaccination records, only five had received both doses of the measles vaccine, according to the department. One received just the first dose. Nationally, officials are seeing the same trend, Schuchat said last week.

""This is not a problem with the measles vaccine not working,"" she said. ""This is a problem of the measles vaccine not being used.""

The CDC is seeing more adult cases of measles than usual during this outbreak, Schuchat said, adding that children are getting the virus, too.

Cases have now been reported in Arizona, California, Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota, Michigan, Nebraska, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Texas, Utah and Washington, according to the CDC. The CDC issued a health advisory Jan. 23, at which point the virus had only spread to six states beyond California and Mexico.

The United States last year reported its highest number of measles cases in two decades with 644 cases as part of 20 separate outbreaks, attributing the spike to a measles outbreak in the Philippines and overseas travelers.

The 102 cases reported between Jan. 1 and Jan. 30 this year are considered part of one outbreak.

The measles virus is contagious long before symptoms appear, and it is airborne, according to the CDC. One infected person with the measles can spread it to an average of 18 other people, and it can linger in the air and live on surfaces to spread after an infected person has left a room.

Complications include hearing loss, pneumonia and swelling of the brain, according to the CDC. About one or two people out of every 1,000 people infected with the measles will die."

Following someone immediately is no longer necessary. Twitter is hoping to attract and retain new users with an instant timeline feature that aims to hook newbies by dropping them straight into an information stream with an interesting and auto-populated timeline.

The feature, which began public testing last week, according to the New York Times, works by scanning a user's contacts and then, by determining who their friends follow, serves up a tailored instant timeline full of everything from sports to celebrity tweets to news.

The company revealed last November at its first ever Analyst Day conference that it would be rolling out instant timeline and other user enhancing experiences as a way to continue to grow its base and expand on the more than 500 million tweets that are sent per day.

Three suspects allegedly stole $4.8 million-worth of gold after one of the two armed guards -- the driver and another man, both inside the truck's cabin -- said that he felt sick and prompted the driver to pull over, Wilson County Sheriff Calvin Woodard Jr. told reporters today.

That account is different from what was presented in the first police report on the case, which said that a mechanical issue caused the truck's driver to pull over.

“There is suspicion at this time that this could be an inside job due to the circumstances of the robbery,"" a Wilson County Sheriff’s Office detective wrote in a search warrant application to get access to one of the guards' cell phones, one of two search warrants in the case obtained today.

""The fact that the truck was robbed immediately upon it pulling over at an unannounced stop is suspicious in and of itself,"" the document added. ""It is also suspicious because there are no markings on the side of the truck that would indicate the type of cargo contained therein. The suspects also went directly to the trailer and found the gold which was in unmarked five gallon buckets. It is not believed that this is a random act due to the nature and facts of this robbery.""

The second search warrant application was to get access to the truck and the trailer it was pulling.

Woodard told reporters today that the case was ""suspicious,"" but declined to reiterate the theory expressed in the search warrant that the robbery could have been an inside job.

Woodard shared sketches of the three suspects who allegedly bound the hands of the driver and the passenger, and a photo of a traffic cone that was placed behind the truck as the suspects allegedly removed the gold from the vehicle after breaking a lock on the back. The traffic cone had the marking of a company that only does work in Florida.

The truck was bringing gold and silver to Bridgewater, Massachusetts, and being driven on I-95 by armed guards employed by a Miami-based company, TransValue Inc., Woodard said.

One of the search warrants states that approximately $5 million-worth of silver was left in the truck, meaning that when the truck left Miami on Sunday morning, it had close to $10 million in metals inside the back compartment, which, the sheriff said, was protected solely by a Master lock on the door.

""The suspects attempted to steal the truck and trailer but could not get the truck started,"" according to one of the search warrants. ""The truck was in proper working condition so the suspects had to [have] not been experienced in the operation of a commercial motor vehicle. The suspects loaded the gold in the minivan and fled the scene.""

The metal was owned by Republic Metals Corporation in Opalocka, Florida, according to a search warrant. The company did not immediately respond to a call seeking comment.

The police said they were seeking a search warrant for the phones of the armed guard who felt sick because of the suspicious nature of the case, but Woodard said at today's news conference that the driver and the passenger have not been considered suspects. Both men have been interviewed separately several times by police, Woodard added.

Woodard noted that the driver and the passenger apparently violated their company’s policies by exiting the vehicle without their firearms and leaving the firearms inside the truck."

Authorities believe the man is Otis Byrd, 54, a convicted murderer out of prison on parole, but an autopsy is being performed to confirm the identity and cause of death.

""We got a young man that died and we're going to determine how he died and if someone did that, that person will be brought to justice and he will be punished for that,"" said Claiborne County Sheriff Marvin Lucas.

Byrd was last seen March 2 and, within days, his family filed a missing person report with the Claiborne County Sheriff’s Office. The FBI and Mississippi Bureau of Investigation were then asked to help, the FBI said in a statement. The man's body was found about a half-mile from Byrd's home.

As a precaution, the FBI has opened a preliminary civil rights investigation, focusing on whether Byrd's race may have played a role in his death. Lucas said his family was unaware of any threats made against him.

Earlier Thursday, the Claiborne County Sheriff's Office and the Mississippi Wildlife Fisheries and Parks conducted a ground search for Byrd."

He's also doing good deeds in real life.

Appearing as Tony Stark, his ""Iron Man"" alter ego, Downey presented a real bionic arm to Alex, a 7-year-old boy who loves superheroes and was born with a partially developed right arm.

Albert Manero, a college student who builds and donates low-cost, 3-D printed bionic limbs to kids around the world, put the two together as part of Microsoft's Collective Project.

And their meeting was captured on video, which Downey posted on Twitter today.

""Honored to present a bionic #IronMan arm to Alex through @MSOneNote’s #CollectiveProject,"" Downey tweeted. ""Check the bowtie. #dapper.""

In the video, you can see Downey greeting young Alex in a dapper red bow tie.

As the pair sit down to check out the bionic arms Downey brought along in metal cases marked Stark Industries, Alex is asked if he knows who Downey is.

""Iron Man,"" he replies without hesitation, causing everyone, including Downey, to break into laughter.

Asked if he knows Downey's name, Alex replies, ""Robert,"" to which Downey responds, ""Great!""

The pair then put on and compare their bionic arms.

""I'm having a technical glitch,"" Downey tells Alex in the video, as the light on his Iron Man arm continually flashes. ""Half the time I design one of these, it winds up breaking on me. But what I do is I keep working on it, kind of like you're working on it with Albert.""

""He keeps working and working until he gets it right,"" Alex replies.

Later, Downey praises Albert.

""Albert has made it so affordable,"" the actor said. ""I'm probably going to start farming out a lot of my tech work to Albert, too. I feel like he could cut down the price point on one of my suits, which is I guess about now a billion and a half dollars.""

American Airlines flight 382 was scheduled to leave for Oklahoma City from Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport at 1:45 p.m. CT Friday, but the plane was grounded until 10:48 p.m. CT.

""We get on the plane and it's just one thing after another,"" said passenger Brandon Sullivan.

Sitting on this @AmericanAir flight for over 3 hours now at @dfwairport #txwx pic.twitter.com/x0kXH1lmuf

Sullivan told ABC News that the plane sat at the gate for hours waiting for de-icing, which was delayed by heavy snow. After about five hours, a mechanical problem kept the plane grounded, said Sullivan.

""We get so excited, we get to the end of the runway and then we find out we have a mechanical problem,"" he said.

American Airlines spokesperson Matt Miller apologized for the ""frustrating experience,"" adding that Friday ""was a challenging day at DFW due to extreme weather impacting north Texas. The safety of our passengers and employees is always our top priority.”

Sullivan said passengers got agitated.

""People were obviously frustrated and there seemed to be no crew around there for a little bit,"" he said. ""People were going in the liquor fridge, pulling out whatever they wanted to drink. It got a little chaotic there for a little bit.""

Rachel Charlton, another passenger, called it an ""up and down"" experience.

""We were happy one second because we thought we were leaving and then the next second we were just deflated because we were turning back to the gate,"" she said.

When the plane returned to a gate, Miller said the crew had to be replaced because they had worked for eight hours, which made it illegal for them to fly.

The flight eventually departed at 10:48 p.m. CT - more than nine hours after some of its passengers initially boarded. It landed in Oklahoma City about a half hour later, according to Flightaware.com.

Because the plane was not held on the tarmac, the delays did not violate the three-hour limit set by the Department of Transportation.

""Ten hours - it feels great to be home,"" said Sullivan. ""It's incredibly stressful day. I don't ever want to do that again."""

“When I got him out of the kennel at the airport he was like he’d never been gone,” the cat’s owner, Cheryl Walls, told ABC News today. “He was nuzzling me under my neck and purring away.”

Walls, 44, of Anderson, South Carolina, adopted the cat, named Kevin, from a local shelter in June 2013 at the urging of her now 13-year-old nephew.

“My fiance passed away on June 5, 2013, and his name was Kevin,” Walls said. “I was going through this depressed, shocked, mourning stage and my nephew wanted a cat so I took him up there and he picked a cat and it just so happened his name was Kevin.”

“So he got called Kevin the cat,” she said.

A few months later, in the fall of 2013, Kevin escaped from Walls’ home and she thought the cat was gone for good.

“Honestly, I thought somebody had picked him up,” she said.

Fast-forward to the first week of March of this year and Walls received an email from an animal shelter in California asking whether Kevin is her cat.

“I called them and, sure enough, they had my cat,” Walls said. “I couldn’t believe it.”

Kevin had been brought to the Riverside County Department of Animal Services’ shelter in Blythe, California, in early March after a Food & Agriculture inspector heard him meowing during a routine inspection of a U-Haul trailer at the Arizona-California border.

“The driver of the U-Haul told the officer she didn’t own a cat so they came to the conclusion that the cat was a stowaway,” said John Welsh, spokesman for Riverside County Animal Services.

“We suspect that, as this lady was loading up her stuff, the cat probably wandered in there,” Welsh said of the U-Haul driver who made the cross-country trek. “There was probably a box inside that was a nice warm spot and he took a nap and next thing you know he’s going for about a 2,300-mile drive.”

Because Walls had adopted Kevin from an animal shelter, the cat had a microchip in him that led Animal Services officials to connect him back to Walls.

“She was blown away,” Welsh said of Kevin’s owner. “She said, I’d love him back but I don’t have the means to get him back.’”

Welsh sought help from a local nonprofit, START Rescue, among others, to raise the funds for a $295 plane ticket for Kevin from California to South Carolina.

On Wednesday, Kevin left Palm Springs International Airport on a morning United Airlines flight. He flew from Palm Springs to Denver, Denver to Chicago and, finally, Chicago to Spartanburg, South Carolina, arriving at the airport there around 8:30 p.m., ET.

Kevin is now back at home “adjusting,” according to Walls, to life with her other pets, two cats and two dogs.

Walls’ 13-year-old nephew who picked Kevin out is “excited” to have him back but the whole family is keeping a close eye on their well-traveled cat.

“He’s indoors right now,” Walls said. “He’s also a very mischievous cat and he tries to shoot out when you open the door, so we’re keeping an eye on him.”"

Deah Barakat, 23, a second-year student in UNC's School of Dentistry, married Yusor Mohammad, 21, in December, and Mohammad planned to begin her dental studies in the fall, authorities said. Her sister, Razan Mohammad Abu-Salha, was a sophomore at North Carolina State University.

Gunshots were reported after 5 p.m. in the Finley Forest condominiums in Chapel Hill, east of the University of North Carolina campus, police said.

Namee Barakat, father of victim Deah Barakat, told ABC News from his home in Raleigh that his son was ""always smiling."" He described his son and daughter-in-law, who met as undergrads at N.C. State, as ""bright, intelligent, thoughtful, generous and loving.""

He said Abu-Salah, from Raleigh, was visiting her sister.

A spokesman from the North Carolina State University said Abu-Salha was majoring in design and on the dean's list for the fall 2014 semester. The university spokesman said Barakat and Mohammad were alumnae of the school.

I just saw this photo of the couple killed in the #ChapelHillShooting...heartbreaking pic.twitter.com/2cE4Dh9opV

""It is with great sadness I share with you the news that the three victims of a shooting yesterday evening near the UNC Chapel Hill campus include a current and two former NC State students,"" NC State Chancellor Randy Woodson said in a statement.

Barakat graduated magna cum laude with a B.S. in business administration in May 2013. Yusor Mohammad graduated cum laude with a B.S. in biological sciences in December 2014, school officials said.

Barakat and ten local dentists and faculty from UNC School of Dentistry were planning a trip this summer to Rihaniya, Turkey, to provide dental care to students there, according to his fundraising page. Barakat was featured in a fundraising video to raise money for the trip.

""Deah and Yusor were exemplary students and activists who believed in humanity and helping people in need,"" Dr. Zaher Sahloul, the president of the Syrian American Medical Society, said in a statement. ""Deah and Yusor felt that they had to do their part to help the Syrian people suffering, and fight the apathy of rest of the world. Their remarkable work and lives will never be forgotten.""

Last summer, Mohammad traveled to Kilis, Turkey, to volunteer in dental relief, according to a Facebook memorial page for the victims.

Barakat tweeted about basketball and various fundraisers for Syrian refugees, including a charitable basketball tournament.

Kids these days lol https://t.co/NS8uRTLZkd

Razan Abu-Salah was recognized by her university two weeks ago for her artistic ability in a time-lapse video of 3-D abstract model-making.

Thousands gathered at ""the Pit,"" a popular courtyard beside the student union, for a vigil to mourn the three, ABC TV station WTVD in Durham reported.

Craig Stephen Hicks, 46, was arrested and is charged with three counts of first-degree murder. He is being held in the Durham County Jail, and the investigation is ongoing, Chapel Hill police said in a news release.

Police are also investigating whether this was a hate crime, though neighbors told authorities that Hicks had an ongoing dispute with the victims.

Gerardi is one of thousands of applicants vying for a trip to Mars, courtesy of an audacious new company called Mars One.

Only 100 potential astronauts will be finalists, but there’s a pretty massive catch: It’s a one-way ticket.

Despite the no-return clause, Mars One said 200,000 people from around the world, including Gerardi, have applied to leave everything on Earth behind.

“I know for a fact that no matter what, in my lifetime, I’m going to space,” said Gerardi, who is newly engaged.

The 26-year-old Florida native trained for the mission in the rocky plains of remote Utah, where she spent three weeks at the Mars Society’s Desert Research Station to learn what it takes for humans to survive on Mars, from moving and breathing in a space suit, to eating bizarre cuisines like zebra tarantulas, because bugs would be a food source on Mars.

The commercial space industry has boomed in recent years, with companies like Space-X and Virgin Galactic building their own rockets and spaceships in an effort to make outer space available to everyone who wants to go.

And it’s not just for sport. Some scientists believe settling other planets is the best hope for human survival.

And when it comes to colonizing Mars, Bas Landorp, the 37-year-old CEO of Mars One, and his team of space experts claim they can do what NASA, so far, has not.

“Accept the new reality,” Landorp said. “Literally everybody on the globe will be watching, just like when Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed on the moon.”

“We’re hiring the established aerospace companies from all over the world to design the systems, to build them, to test them, but no new inventions are needed to implement our program,” he added.

But while Landorp said the technology exists to get people to Mars, his company does not have the technology to bring people back to Earth, so the plan is to form a permanent colony with new crews arriving each year.

Of course there are extreme hurdles to overcome. Mars is about 200 million miles away from Earth, which translates to at least seven months of space travel to get there -- and no one has ever been there before.

But for people like Kellie Gerardi, the unknowns are not scary, just part of the dream.

“I think either you get it or you don't,” she said. “I would equate it almost to seeing Mt. Everest for the first time. Here is this hostile challenging environment, and either you feel a yearning to climb it or you don't. And if you don't, I don't know if--that I could ever explain that to you.”

Gerardi is planning her wedding, but says getting married won’t stop her from leaving Earth and her fiancee is supportive of her decision.

“Everyone makes the joke to us, ‘til Mars do us part,’” she said. “I'm getting married next year. I couldn't be more excited. I couldn't be more in love. Do I still see myself going to space in the future? Yes… I would go, and that's a hard reality.”

Another Mars One hopeful is Sue Ann Pien, a 35-year-old tech worker from Los Angeles. She said finding out she was a potential candidate “changed the entire trajectory” of her life, and she started a sort of Earth bucket list.

“I just took off and I went and I experience amazing things around the world that I wanted to do,” Pien said. “I was going up volcanoes in Bali and scuba diving.”"

The oldest man in Australia spends his time knitting tiny wool sweaters for tiny, injured penguins.

The prolific knitter told Australia's Channel Nine News that when Phillip Island’s Penguin Foundation requested the tiny sweaters following a massive oil spill that injured hundreds of Little Penguins, a species only found in southern Australia and New Zealand, he couldn’t refuse.

""The girls who used to work for me, they'll tell you I'm a sucker. I can't say no,” Date told Nine News.

""It's a good way of getting along in life. You make friends all the time but you don't make a fool of yourself either,” he added.

Date has been knitting for more than 80 years, but this was his first foray into bird knitwear. The Penguin Foundation stresses to eager knitters that “this is not a fashion statement"" -- the sweaters actually prevent the injured penguins from preening and swallowing the toxic oil.

The foundation dubbed Date their “most senior little penguin jumper knitter,"" but they didn’t realize Date was also the most senior Australian citizen.

""It's amazing and we feel quite privileged to have him dedicating his time and effort to the Penguin Foundation,” a spokesperson told Nine News.

But settle down young knitters, according to the Foundation’s website, they ""have plenty of penguin jumpers at this time donated by generous knitters across the globe… and do not need any further donations at this time.”"

In addition, Routh, a former Marine, showed off a gun and truck he stole from Kyle in visits to relatives after the killings, Erath County District Attorney Alan Nash said.

""He admits [later to his sister] that he murdered these two men, that he used drugs and alcohol that morning and he knew what he was doing was wrong,"" Nash said.

Routh, now 27, allegedly shot Kyle, 38, five times in the back and side and once in the top of the head, and shot Kyle's friend Chad Littlefield, 35, four times in the back, once in the hand, once in the face and once in the top of the head, Nash said.

Routh faces life in prison if he is found guilty of the Feb. 2, 2013 murders.

His defense team made it clear in opening statements that it plans to argue that he was insane at the time of the shooting.

""When he took their lives, he was in the grip of a psychosis, a psychosis so severe that he did not know what he was doing was wrong,"" defense attorney Tim Moore said.

He added that Routh thought ""that he had to take their lives because, in his psychosis, he thought they were going to take his.""

Moore said Routh proposed marriage to a woman the night before the fatal shooting, and she was expected to testify at the trial that he was acting strangely.

""He was seeing things, he was hearing things,"" Moore said. ""He was telling her not to talk out loud, to write things down on paper because people were listening.""

Kyle's own texts to Littlefield before picking up his friend suggested Kyle was alarmed by Routh's state of mind.

Kyle texted to Littlefield, ""This dude is straight up nuts,"" while in the car with Routh, Moore said during his opening statement.

Nash described Routh as ""a troubled young man,"" but argued he should be held responsible for killing Kyle and Littlefield.

“Does having a mental illness rise to the level where this defendant doesn’t know right from wrong?” Nash asked the jury.

Kyle's widow, Taya Kyle, shed tears as she testified after the opening arguments. She said she felt uneasy after a final phone conversation she had with Kyle when he was at the gun range, and added that she soon learned of his death from a police officer.

Testifying later was Chad Littlefield's mother, Judy Littlefield, who appeared so overcome with emotion that, at first, she seemed barely able to speak.

If her son was alive, she said, today would have been his 38th birthday. He was ""a very good son,"" she added, noting that he called to check on her every day."

That may be because this year's flu vaccine isn't as strong expected, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The vaccine has an 18 percent effectiveness against the dominant H3N2 flu strain, the CDC reports. Earlier in the season, flu shot protection level was estimated at 23 percent.

Children have even worse odds: for kids ages 2 to 8, the flu vaccine's effectiveness is just 15 percent, according to the CDC.

Children tend to get more viral illnesses than adults, Dr. Besser said, because they're in physical contact with each other and don't have years of flu exposure built up.

The CDC also reports that the nasal-spray version of the vaccine, which was ""recommended especially for young children,"" Dr. Besser said, ""is shown to not be effective at all.""

Dr. Besser added that the CDC will not preferentially recommend the nasal spray vaccine ahead of the shot and both will be recommended as options.

It may be the end of February, but we're still not out of the woods for flu season.

""Flu season is winding down,"" Dr. Besser said, but ""there is still flu activity around the country.""

Dozens of police officers, K-9 officers with their dogs and medical staff lined up outside the Saint Francis Veterinary Center of South Jersey to say goodbye to Judge last Friday.

""Judge and I had such overwhelming and positive support that day,"" West Deptford Police Cpl. Michael Franks told ABC News today. ""Though Judge was extremely lethargic and could barely walk the days before the ceremony, he was able to bite onto his favorite protective decoy arm sleeve used in training and carry it into the hospital.""

Franks and Judge's vet made the decision to lay Judge to rest because he was suffering so much due to complications stemming from Cushings Disease, which he developed last year, Franks said.

The disease causes an overproduction of hormones from the adrenal glands, he said, adding it enlarged all the organs in Judge's body, made him lose hair, weakened his immune system, caused several tumors and made his nose bleed.

""It became unbearable,"" Franks said.

Judge's medical complications started in 2009, when he had a dental procedure done at the University of Pennsylvania due to teeth issues, Franks added.

The issues persisted, and he had to be retired in 2013, he said.

Judge began his seven-year career with the West Deptford Police Department in 2007. He was deployed over 280 times and helped with drug detection, tracking and the apprehension of suspects, Franks said.

""We worked on patrol together, and he lived with me the entire time,"" Franks said. ""He was an excellent work dog and a great family dog. He knew when it was time to work, and he was great with kids at demonstrations. He was also very protective of my own kids at home.""

Thanks to Judge's ""fearless service,"" 152 suspects were arrested for criminal offenses, three motor vehicles and countless drugs were seized, three handguns were taken off of the streets and over $47,000 was recovered from people involved in illegal activity,"" the West Deptford Police Department wrote on Facebook.

""It is with great sadness that the West Deptford Police Department says goodbye to K-9 Judge today,"" the department wrote. ""He was a true asset to our department and will be forever missed. RIP Judge, gone but never forgotten!"""

That's what Dargan Bristow, 16, said to his grandmother when his high school basketball coach put him in to play during Tuesday night's game.

Five years ago, the high school freshman was diagnosed with both fetal alcohol syndrome and autism spectrum disorder.

For the past six years, Dargan's grandparents have been his primary caretakers, moving him from South Carolina to Ohio, where his grandmother Diana Bristow said he's had more opportunities to socialize with others.

""They really preferred [in South Carolina] that kids with special needs do Special Olympics and not participate with team sports, per se,"" Bristow said. ""Since we’ve been in Ohio, he's had all these great coaches and teachers. Proud isn’t even a good word. I'm just awestruck with him. He's become this social butterfly and he loves everything he does.""

One activity Dargan loves is serving as the manager for his basketball team, the Riverside Beavers in De Graff, Ohio.

""My favorite sports are basketball and swimming,"" he said. ""I helped with the water and got out the basketballs for practice. I still help with the water.""

After participating in drills during team practices, Dargan's coach planned on surprising the teen by letting him play in the final six minutes of the game.

""I planned for him to go in the last quarter and he ended up hitting two three-pointers and he had an assist,"" said Rossi Santo, Riverside High School special education teacher and freshman basketball coach. ""It was pretty special. At the end of the game, the team gave him hugs on the floor and the other team gave him high-fives. It was pretty cool.""

Although the Beavers lost the game, Dargan said, for him, it wasn't about winning.

""It's all about being a good sport and having fun, and being part of a team,"" he told ABC News. ""I'm still the manager and I like being able to practice with the team.""

Dargan is looking forward to the final basketball game Feb. 20, when Coach Santo said he will get more playing time.

""He’s great in class, he's an awesome kid,"" Santo said. ""He’s just very happy to be around everyone and he’s happy to have friends. He‘s a good boy. He’s a good, humble boy. His grandparents did a very good job of raising him."""

The package was actually a camera mounted on a bridge, Georgia State University said today.

""We sincerely apologize for the traffic problems resulting yesterday from the mounting of a student camera at the 14th St. Bridge. The camera was one of 18 used by students in an art project and deployed at various locations in the city,"" the school said in a statement. ""Georgia State Police are closely cooperating with the Atlanta Police Department in the removal of all of the cameras.""

Working together, scientists at the University of Washington and the University of Johannesburg in South Africa found evidence that life may have thrived on Earth 3.2 billion years ago, upending the belief that Earth's atmosphere at the time was uninhabitable.

The study is based on an analysis of 52 rock samples collected in South Africa and northwestern Australia and range in age from 2.75 to 3.2 billion years old.

Roger Buick, a University of Washington professor and co-author of the article that was published Monday in the journal Nature, said the rock samples his team analyzed showed that there was plentiful nitrogen 3.2 billion years ago to sustain the most basic life forms, including bacteria, viruses and other organisms.

While life can exist without oxygen, nitrogen is an essential building block for genes.

""People always had the idea that the really ancient biosphere was just tenuously clinging on to this inhospitable planet, and it wasn't until the emergence of nitrogen fixation that suddenly the biosphere become large and robust and diverse,"" Buick told UW Today."

There was one female juror who refused to sentence Arias to death for killing her boyfriend Travis Alexander, leading to an impasse and the hung jury.

“Eleven of us strived for justice for Travis, but to no avail,” one of the jurors said in a group audio news conference this morning. “We absolutely thought [the punishment] should be death.”

The jurors, with the exception of the holdout, spoke about their feelings on the case but did not want their names or faces revealed.

The apparent holdout, who was initially an alternate juror, seemed to come in with more knowledge about the case than others, having told the other jurors that she had seen “bits and pieces” of the Lifetime movie about Arias that aired after the initial trial.

“I think she came in and expected to see a monster in there because of what she saw on TV and the news and when she came in and saw it wasn’t,” one female juror said.

A male juror said he was angry with the holdout.

“I feel that the one holdout had her mind made up from the beginning and what angered me was the biggest thing that angered me was that she alluded that the death penalty would be a form of revenge,” he said.

They also revealed they sent a note to the judge requesting the consideration of an alternate to remove the holdout but that was denied, the jurors said.

The group was not always committed to sentencing Arias to death, with one juror explaining that during their initial deliberations they were split down the middle. But that evolved and led to all but one in support of capital punishment.

Now, Judge Sherry Stephens is tasked with deciding whether Arias should be sentenced to life in prison or life in prison with the possibility for parole in 25 years.

“We really feel like we made a huge effort into trying to get what we believe was deserved, and I cannot say enough how sorry I am,” one female juror said, breaking into tears mid-sentence.

The jurors who addressed the media appeared sympathetic to Alexander and his family, saying that “like they put Travis on trial, [and] focused on that rather than the reason we were there.”

All told the cost of the prosecution and Arias' public defense team was nearly $3,000,000 according to the Associated Press.

Tensions seemed high throughout the news conference, with several moments where jurors broke down in tears.

“I was emotionally struggling for five months,” one person said.

“We've had nightmares,” one female juror said. “I think every single one of us has had nightmares and I hope they go away.”"

A recent poll found that nearly 30% of U.S. adults say they’re trying to go gluten free, and Googling the term generates more than 95 million results. If you’re on the gluten free bandwagon, either because you must avoid gluten due to celiac disease, or because you think you may be gluten intolerant, here are five new bits of info you should know.

15 Diseases Doctors Often Get Wrong

A recent study from researchers at Columbia University concluded that wheat proteins besides gluten may also trigger problematic symptoms in people with celiac disease. While gluten is the primary type of protein in wheat, a substantial number of study subjects with celiac disease had an immune reaction to five groups of non-gluten proteins. In other words, there is likely more to understanding celiac disease than scientists currently know, so stay tuned.

Best and Worst Foods to Avoid Bloating

Until recently, the term “gluten free” hadn’t been regulated or even defined by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. But based on an FDA ruling last August, manufacturers can only use the term on products containing less than 20 parts per million of gluten, the established cutoff also used in Canada and Europe. In other words, while gluten free now has a standardized meaning, it doesn’t mean 100% gluten free. This is partly because the most sensitive test available can only test down to 3 parts per million, and clinical studies have determined that achieving 0 parts per million is not necessary to prevent symptoms in people with celiac disease. That said, I have heard of people reacting to eating foods labeled gluten free, which may be a matter of how much they’re eating, as well as the severity of their sensitivity. If you’re concerned, stick with unpackaged, whole food sources of starch that are naturally gluten free, like fruit, potatoes, squash, and root vegetables.

12 'Unhealthy' Foods Nutritionists Eat

Chains like Pizza Hut and Domino’s have started offering gluten-free crust, but because the pizzas are prepared in the same kitchens as those with gluten, they aren’t considered to be safe for everyone with celiac disease. The same cross-contamination risk may be true for the many other fast food chains that now have gluten-free or gluten-sensitive menus, including Arby’s, Chik-fil-A, and Wendy’s. In fact, Burger King even states that the options aren’t intended for people with celiac disease.

While gluten free has become somewhat synonymous with healthy, clearly there are dozens of unhealthy gluten-free foods. During a recent grocery trip with a client, I spotted many products marked gluten free, including cookies, brownies, pizza, mac and cheese, ice cream sandwiches, chips, and beer. There’s even been talk of a gluten-free Twinkie. While some of these foods are a godsend for people with celiac disease (who can finally eat some of the treats they previously had to avoid), they certainly aren’t the foundation of a nutrient-rich, healthful diet. And as you may have already discovered, these foods are one of the reasons why simply giving up gluten isn’t a magic bullet for weight loss.

While celiac disease and gluten sensitivity are not the same as food allergies, a new technology designed to test foods for allergens will also include gluten detection. TechCrunch reports that the $150 portable sensor device in development from 6SensorLabs will require disposable units that will be inserted into a food to test for risky ingredients, and users will be able to share their results via an app. If it’s accurate it could be a game changer, although it’s not clear if the device works on every single food.

""The evidence here is the boat. It’s movable and it’s very powerful. The jury should be able to see it. It’s really quite striking,"" argued Tsaraev’s defense attorney William Fick in court today. ""The jury should be allowed to see that in its entirety.""

""The government is killing our innocent civilians but most of you already know that,” another portion of the blood-streaked message says. Parts of the note can be seen in an image from the boat obtained by ABC News.

Prosecutors objected to the defense’s argument, telling the court that the boat itself is “very large” and full of “dried blood, broken glass, all kinds of debris.”

""What the defense really wants the jury to see is the boat riddled with bullets,"" argued assistant US Attorney William Weinreb.

Defense attorneys want jurors to have access to the entire Slip Away II, which was dry-docked in the Watertown backyard of its owner and covered with a tarp.

Prosecutors said photos of the bloody note should be sufficient, but they may be willing to extract panels of the boat, rather than let jurors access the entire boat.

Tsarnaev was captured on the boat on April 19, a day after he and his older brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, allegedly executed MIT Police Officer Sean Collier and then led police on a high speed chase in Watertown that ended with when the brothers allegedly exchanged bullets with police and tossed bombs in the street. Tamerlan was killed in the firefight and Dzhokhar went on the run for 16 hours.

Days earlier, prosecutors said, the brothers detonated two pressure cooker bombs near the finish line of the Boston Marathon on April 15, 2013, killing three people - including an 8-year-old boy - and wounding 260 others. Many of the victims were maimed for life, including 16 people who lost limbs.

Both sides also sparred over autopsy photos of the victims. Defense attorneys said that the pictures would traumatize victims' families all over again.
“They are horrific. They are disturbing,’’ defense attorney Miriam Conrad told the court.

Prosecutors told the court the pictures of the dead were an essential part of the government's case and ""chosen carefully.""

O'Toole did not rule on any of the motions today. Opening statements in Tsarnaev’s murder trial are expected Wednesday morning.

Tsarnaev was in court for today’s hearing, wearing dress shoes, a black blazer and sporting a recent haircut with a neatly trimmed beard on his chin."
1aRa5Je,2015-03-06 00:00:00,Joe Biden Blasts Ben Carson’s ‘Ridiculous Assertion’ On Gay People - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/joe-biden-blasts-ben-carsons-ridiculous-assertion-gay/story?id=29447703,"Speaking at a gathering of LGBT rights activists today, Vice President Joe Biden took a swipe at potential Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson for his recent remark that being gay is a choice.

Biden, who has been a longtime advocate for gay rights, called Carson’s comment a “ridiculous assertion.”

“I mean Jesus God. I mean it’s kind of hard to fathom,” Biden told an audience at the Human Rights Campaign spring equality convention in Washington, D.C.

Carson, a retired neurosurgeon, sparked controversy when on Wednesday he said in an interview with CNN that gay people chose their sexuality because “a lot of people who go into prison go into prison straight--and when they come out, they’re gay.”

Yesterday, CNN reported, he apologized for it in a statement: ""I do not pretend to know how every individual came to their sexual orientation. I regret that my words to express that concept were hurtful and divisive. For that I apologize unreservedly to all that were offended.”

Fighting through a cold and with a hoarse voice, Biden argued for basic human rights not just in the U.S. but for the world and said he was “optimistic” that this country would enact federal anti-discrimination legislation, but that we “have to pass it now.”

“Granted we've come a great distance and we've still have much further to go...The momentum is undeniably on our side. It is not capable of being slowed, it is not capable of being stopped,” Biden said. “We are all entitled to basic human rights.”

He also drew comparisons between the civil rights march across Selma’s Edmund Pettus Bridge and the Stonewall Riots, when the gay community protested the police raiding of New York City gay bars, calling them “the same basic movement.”"

Shane Harrington, a Lincoln, Nebraska-based pornography site operator for the last 14 years, has set his sights on opening three strip clubs along Interstate 80 and is marketing his ventures as alcohol- and drug-free environments that will serve fresh juices alongside adult entertainment.

But some locals say the possible businesses would go against the family-focused nature of the community.

""I don’t mean any ill will against Mr. Harrington. He has a legal right to make money how he pleases,"" the Rev. Andrew Ratcliffe, a pastor at St. John Lutheran Church in Seward, Nebraska, told ABC News. ""But from the pastoral side and as a family-based community, we’re trying to defend the value of women and to preserve the family-based aspect of the community.""

Ratcliffe was one of more than 20 people who attended a Seward County Planning and Zoning Board meeting Monday night, then raised objections to reporters outside the meeting about the idea of all-nude juice bars after learning the matter wasn't on the board's agenda.

The reason it was left off: Harrington hasn't actually purchased any property for his bars or applied for a zoning application.

The 39-year-old entrepreneur told ABC News he is considering locations in Seward and Grand Island, Nebraska, and a possible third location between Lincoln and Omaha, Nebraska.

""I went in a month ago to a zoning meeting saying that I found a location I really liked and was interested in opening this type of business. It was a very unofficial conversation, but word spread fast and over a 30-day span now there are church groups picketing,"" he said. ""Nebraska is a very 'Leave It To Beaver,' Bible-belt place.""

Harrington told ABC News he is currently eyeballing a 13,000-square-foot space that formerly housed a dinosaur museum, which officials told him was one of the only locations they would consider for the project.

""It's far removed from churches, far from town,"" Harrington said. ""I’m actually against strip clubs being in towns where kids can ride their bikes past them. I want to be on the outskirts, where there is nobody around.""

Harrington added that his adult entertainment company already has an established customer base in the area.

""We do a record number of bachelor parties, birthday parties, private parties in Seward County with dancers who have appeared on our site,"" Harrington said.

Responses on the business owner's Facebook page supported that statement, with users writing, ""I live in Seward and I support ya,"" and, ""You have my support.""

Because his businesses won't serve alcohol, patrons will get more eye candy for their money, Harrington said.

""With a juice bar you can do full nude and actually touch the girls,"" he said, adding that when a strip club's bar serves liquor, pasties and panties are required and guests must stay six inches from the entertainers.

The Seward County Planning and Zoning Board did not immediately respond to an inquiry on whether Harrington’s understanding of the no-alcohol rules were correct, or to say whether or not there were existing strip clubs in the area.

Should he pursue the former museum space, Harrington estimated that he will be up and running his juice-themed gentleman's club within three months.

""We will open a second location three months after that and then wait a year before opening a third to make sure we're not over-saturating the market,"" he said. ""But we're opening whether they like it or not."""
1ARJoOI,2015-02-18 00:00:00,Obama Administration Unlikely to Seek Emergency Stay on Immigration Ruling - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/obama-administration-seek-emergency-stay-immigration-ruling/story?id=29035271,"While President Obama has made it clear his administration will appeal District Court Judge Andrew Hanen’s ruling blocking his executive action on immigration, the president’s immigration plan will likely be on hold for months or longer.

Though no final decision has been made, Obama administration sources told ABC News today that the Department of Justice is unlikely to seek an emergency stay to block the judge’s order. The reason is simple: While DOJ thinks it will ultimately prevail on the overall appeal, department officials believe they would not succeed in seeking an emergency stay of Judge Hanen’s ruling.

The judge’s ruling is likely to remain in place while the case is appealed before the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals and, quite possibly, to the Supreme Court. That process is likely to take six months -- or longer. That means the 5 million undocumented immigrants who would have benefited from the president's executive action will have to wait.

President Obama expressed confidence today that his executive actions on immigration will ultimately be upheld after a Texas district court injunction blocked the plans from being implemented.

“I think the law is on our side and history is on our side,” President Obama told reporters in the Oval Office today.

The ruling came just a day before applications for DACA, which expand upon the president's previous 2012 DACA program to remove age restrictions, were set to begin. The judge’s order also put a pause on Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA) applications, which allow parents of American citizens to seek legal status. DAPA applications were not set to be accepted until later this year.

“I disagree with the Texas judge’s ruling and the Justice Department will appeal. This is not the first time where a lower court judge has blocked something or attempted to block something that ultimately was shown to be lawful,” the president said. “I’m confident that it is well within my authority and the tradition of the executive branch’s prosecutorial discretion to execute this policy.”

The president said the Department of Homeland Security will adhere to the ruling and not move forward with applications for DACA and DAPA, but he noted the department will continue to prepare to administer the plans once the legal issues are resolved.

“We’re not going to disregard this federal court ruling. The law is the law in this country, and we take things a step at a time,” Obama said.

Judge Hanen’s ruling does acknowledge the administration’s right to exercise prosecutorial discretion about who is targeted for deportation, but said the DACA and DAPA programs went a step further and changed legal status of the population. While the undocumented immigrants covered by the president’s executive actions will not be able to apply for work permits, the department can decide which people and cases to prioritize for deportation. The department has previously said it will not go after “moms with kids,” but without DACA and DAPA there is no way for the population to register with the government and legally be reprieved from deportation.

Attorney General Eric Holder said at a news conference today that the DOJ is still reviewing the decision and determining how the administration will proceed with the appeals process. But he said the judge's ruling is just one ruling, and it is an ""interim step"" on an issue that will ultimately be decided by a higher court.

The ruling comes at a time when Congress is embroiled in a fight over funding for the Department of Homeland Security that expires Feb. 27. Democrats have repeatedly filibustered a Republican-backed measure to fund the department that includes provisions that would halt the president’s recent executive actions from going into effect.

Congressional Republicans are using the ruling as another tool to insist Democrats back their funding plan for the Department of Homeland Security.

“This ruling underscores what the president has already acknowledged publicly 22 times: He doesn’t have the authority to take the kinds of actions he once referred to as 'ignoring the law' and 'unwise and unfair,'"" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement today. ""Senate Democrats -- especially those who've voiced opposition to the president’s executive overreach -- should end their partisan filibuster of Department of Homeland Security funding.""

""The Senate Democrats who are filibustering Department of Homeland Security funding should look hard at this ruling,” Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said in a statement today. “At a time when we face grave national security threats, at home and abroad, it is the height of irresponsibility for the Democrats to block this funding in an extreme attempt to save Obama's amnesty, which a federal judge has just declared illegal.""

President Obama urged lawmakers to pass funding for the Department of Homeland Security “so they can go forward with all the functions that Republicans say they want carried out, including strong border security functions.”

But he also pressed Republicans to work with Democrats on immigration reform.

“With a new Congress, my hope has been that they now get serious in solving the problem. Instead what we’ve had is a series of votes to kick out young people who have grown up here and who everybody recognizes are part of our community, and threats to defund the Department of Homeland Security, which would make it even harder for us to protect our borders and keep our people safe,” the president said.

""My strong advice right now to Congress is, if they are seriously concerned about immigration, about our borders, about being able to keep criminals out of this country then what they should be doing is working together and working with the administration for a comprehensive immigration policy that allows us to be both a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants,” he added.

The 15-and-a-half-year old mutt has been owner Risa Feldman's ""baby boy"" since she rescued him 12 years ago, so when he was diagnosed with bone cancer and given two-to-six months to live, she just wanted the rest of his life to be happy. He loves long walks along Manhattan Beach, California, where Feldman sits outside with a coffee and orders Ike a side of bacon, she said.

""He's so happy to watch everybody,"" Feldman told ABC News. ""It's his favorite thing to do. He'll lay there in the sun.""

Ike has cancer in one of his back legs, making it painful for him to get around, she said. To walk Ike, Feldman had been lifting his back legs off the ground in a kind of harness, but it's been tough. And Ike has a wheelchair to hold up his back legs while he walks on his front paws, but he gets tired, she said.

So Feldman went to Home Depot and asked an employee for help modifying a cart for Ike. The employee, Ernesto Moran, told her he'd think about it and give her a call.

He and his coworker, Justin Wadman, eventually came up with a solution: a custom wagon with a ramp that was just Ike's size. And they decided to do it for free.

""I offered to build this for her and let her know that it's something that Home Depot offers -- giving back to our customers,"" Moran told ABC's Los Angeles station, KABC.

Feldman said she brought the story to the attention of KABC because, ""I just wanted people to know that there are still people out there who do good things, really.""

The wagon still needs a few tweaks, but Feldman should be able to take it home in a couple days, she said. She's looking forward to seeing her dog's content face.

""It's almost like a smile,"" she told ABC News. ""His face, it lights up."""
1ArMyVn,2015-03-21 00:00:00,Man Charged in Ferguson Shooting That Injured 2 Police Officers - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/US/arrest-made-ferguson-shooting-injured-police-officers/story?id=29652783,"A 20-year-old man has been arrested in connection with a shooting outside the headquarters of the Ferguson police department that injured two officers, St. Louis County police and prosecutors said Sunday.

Jeffrey Williams was arrested Saturday night and charged with two counts of first-degree assault, one count of firing a weapon from a vehicle and three counts of armed criminal action, said St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch. Williams was being held on $300,000 cash bond.

The two officers were injured early Thursday during heated protests outside the the police department after the resignation of the city's police chief, Tom Jackson, who stepped down in the wake of a Justice Department report that documented widespread racial bias in the city, biases that have gained national attention since the August police shooting of unarmed black teen Michael Brown.

Williams, 20, fired the shots from a car moving through the area, McCulloch said. It's unclear whether he meant to shoot the police officers, said McCulloch, since Williams told investigators he was involved in some sort of dispute prior to the shooting.

McCulloch said a handgun recovered from Williams matched shell casings found from the scene of the shooting.

It appears Williams was the only person who fired any shots, McCulloch said, but there may be other people who were ""participants."" The investigation is ongoing.

Attorney General Eric Holder released a written statement on the arrest today, saying it ""sends a clear message that acts of violence against our law enforcement personnel will never be tolerated.""

“The finding that was made [by the Department of Justice] was that it was not unreasonable to determine that there was not sufficient evidence to charge Officer [Darren] Wilson. That was an objective, thorough, independent federal investigation,” Obama said in response to a question at a town hall discussion on expanding minority youth opportunities,"" he said at a town hall meeting in South Carolina.

“We may never know exactly what happened. But Officer Wilson like anybody else who is charged with a crime benefits from due process and a reasonable doubt standard. And if there is uncertainty about what happened then you can’t just charge them anyway just because what happened was tragic.”

Regardless, Obama said the Justice Department investigation into racial bias in Ferguson’s police department was “very clear.”

“What we saw was that Ferguson police department in conjunction with municipality saw traffic stops, arrests, and tickets as revenue generators as opposed to serving,” he continued, adding the overwhelmingly white force was “systematically” biased, placing minorities under its care into an “oppressive and abusive situation.”

His Attorney Gen. Eric Holder sat in the audience at South Carolina’s Benedict College, a historically black liberal arts school.

Earlier on Friday, the president said the problems at Ferguson are not uniform across police departments in America, but they’re not isolated either.

Racist emails between officers and routine arrests of minorities without probable cause were also exposed in the investigation, which the agency found amounted to a “pattern and practice” of unlawful conduct by local law enforcement in a city where two in three residents are minorities. The findings would be seen as validation by supporters of the widespread protests to police killings of African-American men in Ferguson, Cleveland, and New York, which sparked a nationwide discussion about police force, race relations and how police treat minorities.

Some of those demonstrators from Ferguson are also planning to be in Selma.

Despite the harsh report, the agency said Wednesday it would not pursue charges against Wilson. A St. Louis grand jury also cleared him of an indictment at the state level last November.

Today was the president’s first trip to South Carolina since assuming the Oval Office.

But what is it?

#BlackOutDay is a social media campaign today celebrating black beauty and fighting against negative images and stereotypes perpetuated in the media, YouTube personality Franchesca Ramsey told ABC News today.

Oh my soul. RT@RwhoweR: Why #BlackOutDay is important. pic.twitter.com/ouqzk0gIev

""We're asking black people to share pictures, videos and GIFs of themselves to celebrate our people coming from all different walks of life,"" Ramsey said. ""It's a celebration of black beauty and our individuality.

""Unfortunately, in most popular media talking about black people and our bodies, it's mostly of us breaking the law, being killed or mistreated,"" Ramsey added. ""So it's nice to combat these negative images and stereotypes with positive representations of ourselves.""

A Tumblr friend reached out to Ramesy, she said,  to help promote the social media event created by someone named T'von under the Tumblr username ""expect-the-greatest.""

Other ""Tumblr-famous"" bloggers like V. Matthew King-Yarde, who runs ""WhatWhitesWillNeverKnow,"" helped spread awareness to make sure the campaign would go viral. Yarde also created a logo for the campaign, he said, while fellow friend Marissa Sebastian came up with the hashtag.

T'von was inspired to propose the campaign after feeling like he never saw regular black people being celebrated on his Tumblr dashboard, he wrote on Tumblr.

""I’m really sick and tired of seeing the 'European standard of beauty' prevail,"" he said. ""It’s past time for the beauty of black people to be showcased.""

Why we DONT EVER need #WhiteOutDay pic.twitter.com/Kl1Vx4suEb

""Black History Month is always excellent, but one month isn’t enough to celebrate our heritage and our beauty,"" T'von added of February. ""[...] ALL black people are beautiful and worthy of praise and admiration, and Blackout day is a step towards that.”

Ramsey loved the message T'von wants to send, she said, adding that there's limited representation of black women particularly in entertainment and fashion.

""It's a narrow representation,"" she said. ""Black people are not a monolith. We come in so many different skin tones, hair types, personalities. One of my followers sent me a message showing the pictures to her little sister who doesn't feel confident about her dark skin and hair, and she felt better and more empowered.""

1aRvVwt,2015-03-06 00:00:00,"UN Official: ISIS Destruction of Ancient City of Nimrud, Artifacts a ‘War Crime’ - ABC News",http://abcnews.go.com/International/isis-destruction-ancient-city-artifacts-war-crime/story?id=29441874,"The head of the United Nation’s cultural organization said today that the continued looting and destruction of ancient artifacts – most recently ISIS's “bulldozing” of one of Mesopotamia’s greatest cities – constitutes nothing less than a “war crime.”

“I condemn in the strongest possible manner the destruction of the archaeological site of Nimrud site in Iraq. This is yet another attack against the Iraqi people, reminding us that nothing is safe from the cultural cleansing underway in the country: It targets human lives, minorities, and is marked by the systematic destruction of humanity’s ancient heritage,” Irina Bokova, Director of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization said today. “We cannot remain silent. The deliberate destruction of cultural heritage constitutes a war crime. I call on all political and religious leaders in the region to stand up and remind everyone that there is absolutely no political or religious justification for the destruction of humanity’s cultural heritage.”

Bokova’s statement came a day after Iraqi television reported that ISIS militants had “bulldozed” Nimrud, the second capital of the Assyrian Empire founded during the 13th century B.C., which lies approximately 20 miles south of Mosul, according to the UN. The Associated Press reported that the discovery of treasures in Nimrud’s royal tombs in the 1980s was “one of the 20th century’s most significant archaeological finds.”

“[Nimrud’s] frescos and works are celebrated around the world and revered in literature and sacred texts,” Bokova said.

Beyond the human toll of countless of ISIS’s alleged war crimes – including the systematic murder of unarmed civilians and prisoners, persecution of minorities and the use of young women as sex slaves – academics and officials have said ISIS has targeted for destruction anything that doesn’t conform to their twisted interpretation of Islam, no matter the cultural value.

Last week video emerged that appeared to show ISIS militants taking sledgehammers to artifacts in a museum in Mosul, pushing over statues and drilling into other ancient treasures. Some of the statues appear to have metal rods inside them, suggesting they’re replicas, but others just crumble when they hit the floor.

“These antiquities and idols behind me were from people in past centuries and were worshiped instead of God,” an unidentified man says in the video. “When God Almighty orders us to destroy these statues, idols and antiquities, we must do it, even if they’re worth billions of dollars.”

But ISIS is hardly above stealing ancient treasures for financial gain. David Cohen, Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence at the U.S. Treasury Department, named looting as one financial supply line for ISIS and said the group “lay[s] waste to thousands of years of civilization in Iraq and Syria by looting and selling antiquities.”

In January ISIS purportedly stole around 2,000 books from the Central Library of Mosul, loading up the texts including children’s stories and poetry, and trucking them away, according to The New York Times. They left only the Islamic texts.

“These books promote infidelity and call for disobeying Allah,” a bearded militant reportedly told locals. “So they will be burned.”

Looting has been a major problem for cultural heritage since the outset of the Syrian civil war. As noted by the website TraffickingCulture.org, satellite images show the destruction at one site, the ancient Syrian city of Apamea, that took place just between 2011 and 2012. An image from the latter period shows the ground covered in pockmarks, presumably thousands of holes dug by looters.

In 2013, the International Council on Museums issued an “emergency red list” identifying categories of Syrian artifacts that are in danger of being looted so that museums, private collectors, auction houses and art dealers would know not to buy them.

“Objects from these sites are highly coveted in the international art and antiquities markets and therefore subject to theft, looting and illicit trafficking,” the notice says.

“What started as opportunistic theft by some has turned into an organized transnational business that is helping fund terror,” Michael Danti, an archaeologist at Boston University, told The Wall Street Journal last month. “It’s the gravest cultural emergency I’ve seen.”

Bokova said ISIS’s latest acts in Iraq must not be tolerated by the world.

“I call on all of those who can, especially youth, in Iraq and elsewhere, to do everything possible to protect this heritage, to claim it as their own, and as heritage of the whole of humanity,” she said. “I appeal also to all cultural institutions, museums, journalists, professors, and scientists to share and explain the importance of this heritage and the Mesopotamian civilization. We must respond to this criminal chaos that destroys culture with more culture.”"
1AS0iMA,2015-03-02 00:00:00,N. Korea Warns of 'Merciless Strikes' as It Launches 2 Missiles Into the Sea - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/International/korea-warns-merciless-strikes-launches-missiles-sea/story?id=29319874,"Tensions on the Korean Peninsula are on the rise, with North Korea warning of ""merciless"" war and launching two missiles as the joint United States-South Korean forces launched annual military drills on Monday.

The communist country test-fired two short-range ballistic missiles into the East Sea from Nampo, located 37 miles southwest of Pyongyang, North Korea, early Monday. Both flew about 310 miles, according to South Korea's Defense Ministry.

The test firings of missiles and rockets are often means of expressing dissatisfaction and are conducted regularly, especially during this time of the year. North Korea denounces the annual joint military exercises by U.S. and South Korean forces as rehearsals for a northern invasion aimed at toppling the country's regime.

“Key Resolve and Goal Eagle, which will last 'til April 24, are dangerous nuclear war drills for invading the DPRK,” an unidentified staff of the North Korean military said in a statement carried by the state Korea Central News Agency (KCNA).

North Korean leader Kim Jong-un called for his military to become elite guard units in full preparation for war with the United States, KCNA reported Saturday. Kim's statement was made as he inspected the new guard unit hall at a war museum. The title of guard is the highest given to elite units, and was created in 1950 during the Korean War.

Pyongyang offered last month to temporarily halt nuclear tests if the U.S. suspended those exercises with South Korea. Seoul and Washington have flatly rejected that proposal."
1ASCMj6,2015-02-18 00:00:00,Patriots Locker Room Attendant Tried to Put Unapproved Ball Into AFC Final - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/patriots-locker-room-attendant-put-unapproved-ball-afc/story?id=29040309,"One source said that the attendant assigned to the officials' locker room, identified as 48-year-old Jim McNally, has been interviewed by investigators for Ted Wells, the attorney the NFL hired last month to lead an investigation into allegations the Patriots intentionally used underinflated footballs on offensive plays in the first half of that game against the Indianapolis Colts, which New England won 45-7.

Three sources said that McNally has worked Patriots games for a decade, and has been in charge of the officials' locker room at Gillette Stadium since at least 2008. In the first half of the AFC Championship Game, the sources said, McNally tried to give the unapproved football to an alternate official who was in charge of the special-teams footballs. Those footballs are known as ""kicking balls"" or ""K balls.""

Before every NFL game, footballs are inspected and measured by NFL officials in their locker room before they can be approved for in-game use. The ""K balls"" are used for special teams, and not by the offenses of either team.

NFL officials put a special mark or stamp on each ball approved for use on offensive possessions, as well as the ""K balls"" used on special teams, to ensure only properly inspected and approved footballs are used in that game. Walt Anderson, the referee for the AFC title game, had personally inspected and marked each of the footballs that were approved for use in that game.

The alternate official, Greg Yette, became suspicious when he noticed that the football McNally handed him did not have the proper markings on it, three sources said. One of those sources added that Yette found it surprising that the officials' locker room attendant was on the field, trying to hand him a ball, because officials' locker room attendants don't typically have ballhandling responsibilities during NFL games. Once McNally tried to introduce the unapproved football into the game, the source said, Yette notified the NFL's vice president of game operations, Mike Kensil, who was at the game in the press box.

Sources said they are not sure at what point during the first half McNally tried to introduce the impermissible football to Yette. They didn't know his motivation for doing so, either. Yette, when reached by ""Outside the Lines,"" declined to comment.

An ""Outside the Lines"" reporter approached McNally at his home in Amherst, New Hampshire, earlier this month, but he said, ""I can't talk to you,"" waving the reporter away as he walked up his driveway.

McNally is a part-time employee who was hired by The Kraft Group, a company owned by Patriots owner Robert Kraft. Kelly Way, the director of operations for TeamOps at Gillette Stadium, said NFL game-day employees are paid by The Kraft Group. McNally is not listed in the Patriots' main switchboard directory."
1AsofGI,2015-03-16 00:00:00,Jeb Bush and Scott Walker Jostle for Position in New Hampshire - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/jeb-bush-scott-walker-face-off-hampshire/story?id=29650161,"Jeb Bush and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker are two possible presidential candidates who were in New Hampshire this weekend for the same reason: to introduce themselves to voters. Though there were some similarities in the schedules of the two would-be front-runners, the men received starkly different reactions.

The enthusiasm that Walker earned at his address to the 2016 Kickoff Grassroots Training Session in Concord hosted by the New Hampshire GOP Saturday was missing at the house party held for Bush Friday night. At the house party, the crowd of roughly 100 invited guests and upward of 60 media attendees packed the home of Fergus Cullen, the state’s former GOP chairman, forcing everyone to stand throughout because there was simply no room to sit down.

On Saturday, the high school auditorium filled with volunteer activists for Walker’s speech all had a seat but chose to get on their feet multiple times throughout his nearly 45-minute speech.

Another show of support at Walker’s event that was lacking at Bush’s was a smattering of “hallelujah” affirmations throughout his talk.

“I think he’s a man of great courage,” Denis Cronin told ABC News after Walker’s speech. “I thought he was great. Very articulate.”

Walker generated more passion – on both sides – because of his fight against unions in Wisconsin. There were several dozen union workers protesting outside the high school where Walker held his event Saturday, though they dispersed when it started lightly snowing an hour before the governor arrived.

There were no such protests at either public Bush function, only interest in seeing the next member of the political family try to win over Granite State voters.

“He’s somebody you have to see and listen to him, but I don't agree with a lot of his immigration stuff,” said Ken Hawkins, a former state representative who spoke to ABC News before Walker’s speech at the New Hampshire GOP event.

“I think that people are tired of Bushes just like they're tired of Clinton's just like they were tired of Kennedys,” Hawkins said.

The son and brother of former presidents is going to have a tougher time portraying himself as an “everyman” than the son of a preacher who flipped burgers growing up and whose sons went to public school. Walker talked about his love of Kohl’s cash, boasting that he bought the sweater he was wearing for $1 Friday, while Bush talked about a conversation he had with the founder of Uber and how new self-serve soda machines at his movie theater in South Coral Gables, Florida, will lead to fewer low-income jobs.

When it comes to policy, Bush, whose events were in Dover and Hudson, has the hurdle of reaffirming himself as a conservative in spite of his support for immigration overhaul and Common Core education standards. In tackling those particular issues, he won the support of moderate Republicans or self-proclaimed independents -- like Brian Lenzi, who attended the party at Cullen’s house and thought Bush “presented himself very well” – but will lose conservatives at the same time.

“I think based on what I am hearing, he’s trying to appeal to the center and that’s not what I’m looking for,” fellow Cullen party attendee Fenton Groen told ABC News.

Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry was in New Hampshire at the end of last week as well, making stops at VFW Halls upstate, and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz is scheduled to address a technology company as one of his stops today. On top of these individual visits, a growing list that now appears to be the entire possible Republican field will be back next month for the First in the Nation summit hosted by the New Hampshire GOP. But the New Hampshire residents who have been through the primary circus for decades know that it is early yet.

One indication – besides the calendar – comes from the manager of the Puritan’s Backroom restaurant, a restaurant and ice cream parlor that turns into a regular grip-and-grin stop at the heat of the campaign season.

“No one's come yet but it's very early,” she said Saturday afternoon. “They're mostly doing planned events now and they come by here later.”"

“We have reopened,” Laurent Mimoun, one of Hyper Cacher supermarket’s owners, said. “It has been two months. As you can imagine we are thinking of the victims. Yesterday night when we were alone in the shop we were thinking of the victims. This was the motivation behind the reopening and we couldn't wait to reopen and to rebuild what could be rebuilt - the physical things.”

Inside, there was little sign of the carnage that left four people dead that day in January. The damage was repaired and a steady crowd of young and old lined up to buy groceries.

“I am not afraid,” Annie Boukobza, one of the shoppers, said as she purchased boxes of matzo.

“We need to reflect on what happened. It was a tragic event. We are all close to what happened. We live here and now we are coming back to shop here again because this is where we used to come regularly and we are not afraid.”

The attacks left four people dead at the market, in addition to a policewoman who was shot and 12 people killed at Charlie Hebdo’s office.

Outside the market, a memorial to the victims, flowers and faded signs, remains. One sign read, “We are all Jews, We are all Police, We are all Charlie.”

Jeffrey Williams was arrested Saturday night and charged with two counts of first-degree assault, one count of firing a weapon from a vehicle and three counts of armed criminal action, said St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch. Williams was being held on $300,000 cash bond.

The two officers were injured early Thursday during heated protests outside the the police department after the resignation of the city's police chief, Tom Jackson, who stepped down in the wake of a Justice Department report that documented widespread racial bias in the city, biases that have gained national attention since the August police shooting of unarmed black teen Michael Brown.

Williams, 20, fired the shots from a car moving through the area, McCulloch said. It's unclear whether he meant to shoot the police officers, said McCulloch, since Williams told investigators he was involved in some sort of dispute prior to the shooting.

McCulloch said a handgun recovered from Williams matched shell casings found from the scene of the shooting.

It appears Williams was the only person who fired any shots, McCulloch said, but there may be other people who were ""participants."" The investigation is ongoing.

Attorney General Eric Holder released a written statement on the arrest today, saying it ""sends a clear message that acts of violence against our law enforcement personnel will never be tolerated.""

A statement on behalf of the Fraternal Order of Police in St. Louis said, ""We are relieved for our brother officers, their families and the people of Ferguson that this dangerous gunman is off the street and behind bars where he belongs.""

U.S. District Judge Callie V.S. Granade has instructed Mobile County Probate Judge Don Davis to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples.

""If Plaintiffs take all steps that are required in the normal course of business as a prerequisite to issuing a marriage license to opposite-sex couples, Judge Davis may not deny them a license on the ground that Plaintiffs constitute same-sex couples or because it is prohibited by the Sanctity of Marriage Amendment and the Alabama Marriage Protection Act or by any other Alabama law or Order pertaining to same-sex marriage,"" Granade said in the ruling today.

Robert Povilat and his partner Milton Persinger exchanged vows in the atrium of the probate office as the first of several couples to get their marriage license in Mobile County, reports The Associated Press.

""Ecstatic. Ecstatic. We're married,"" Povilat told the AP.

On Tuesday, the Autauga County Sheriff in Alabama said that an ordained minister was arrested refusing to leave the Autauga County Probate Office, and not for trying to perform a same-sex marriage.

Anne Susan Diprizio, 44, of Prattville, Alabama, was trying to officiate the wedding of a same-sex couple inside the office just after the couple received their marriage license.

Same-sex couples married in some Alabama courthouses this week, but many counties refused to allow the unions despite rulings on Monday from a federal judge and the U.S. Supreme Court to permit them."

“Crowd funding is in the air and on the news, so moms -- along with everyone else -- are more aware of the idea,” said Rebecca Michals, director of BabyCenter’s global community. BabyCenter's parenting experts spotted the trend of crowd-funding kids' parties.

The number of birthday-related campaigns within the ""Celebrations & Special Events"" category on GoFundMe has ""skyrocketed,"" according to a site official. Since the company launch in 2010, nearly $1 million has been raised for birthday celebrations from more than 20,000 donors. There was a 330 percent increase in donation volume for birthday campaigns between 2013 and 2014.

“Social media has an influence,"" said Michals. ""Some moms see photos of their friends giving their children amazing birthdays and holidays and just want that for their own child. While it’s not a sure thing that donations will come rolling in, moms feel that it can’t hurt to try. There is also some sense of what goes around, comes around. ... If you give to my child’s birthday party, I’ll give back to yours.”

The idea of crowd-funded birthday parties has it's critics.

""It ridiculous,"" said Lyss Stern, CEO and founder of Divamoms.com. ""There is no reason to put yourself in debt or ask other people to pay for a birthday party.""

Children want to be surrounded with their friends and family, smiling and laughing on their birthday,"" said Stern. ""They don't care if the party had all the bells and whistles. They will cherish the happy memories not the excessiveness."""

Brody of Edgemont, New York, worked at a jewelry store in Chappaqua, New York. Two colleagues at the jewelry store and a Westchester County, New York, official who knew her ""for years"" confirmed her identity.

Brody was killed in the crash and ensuing fire along with five passengers on the train.

""She had a heart of gold. She really looked for the best in everybody. She was the most positive, wonderful person -- a beautiful mother,"" Brody's longtime friend and colleague, Sasha Alexander, told ABC News.

""We are devastated for the tragedy that everybody has been inflicted with,"" Alexander added. ""I loved her dearly; she had an incredible heart. She was like a saint.""

The SUV wrapped around the front of the train and was driven 400 feet down the track, dislodging the electrified third rail. The rail apparently went through the SUV, punctured the gas tank, caused an explosion and then went through the floor of the train behind the motorman’s compartment.

Brody's Mercedes remained at the scene on the tracks but NTSB investigators said that they will be moving as much evidence as possible to a storage container in the coming days.

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo told ABC News Radio that “it would be apparently inexplicable” that the SUV driver pulled forward onto the tracks and into the path of the oncoming train, as a witness reported.

A go-team from the National Transportation Safety Board arrived at the crash site this morning to investigate, and has not yet disclosed any conclusions.

All but one of the victims was said to be burned beyond recognition in the crash.

“The largest treasure of gold coins discovered in Israel was found in recent weeks on the seabed in the ancient harbor in Caesarea,” Israel's Antiquities Authority said in a statement.

The authority said 2,000 gold coins were discovered by chance off the northern coastal city when members of a diving club stumbled upon them and informed the Antiquities Authority's marine division.

“At first, they thought they had spotted a toy coin from a game,"" the authority's statement said. ""It was only after they understood the coin was the real thing that they collected several coins and quickly returned to the shore in order to inform the director of the dive club about their find.”

Using metal detectors, the 2,000 coins were brought to the surface, weighing in at just more than 13 pounds. Experts believe the coins belonged to the Fatimid Caliphate, which ruled much of the Middle East and North Africa from 909 to 1171.

The earliest coin was minted in Palermo, Sicily in the second half of the 9th century.

Given the possibility of more buried coins in the area, archaeologists have launched further excavations.

The former rapper, whose real name is Robert Van Winkle, was booked into the Palm Beach County Jail, and charged with burglary residence and grand theft, according to a Chief Sean Scheller at the Lantana Police Department. He was released from jail tonight.

Van Winkle spoke to West Palm Beach, Florida, ABC affiliate WPBF. ""It's just out of proportion I wish you guys would focus on the good things I've done,"" he told the station. Asked if the incident is part of his reality show, he laughed and said, ""I wish it was--there's nothing fun about this. I wish everyone the best and maybe the good news will travel this fast.""

In December, the police investigated a burglary at a home near a residence Van Winkle has been renovating. According to authorities, the missing items -- which included furniture, a pool heater, bicycles and other items -- were found at Van Winkle's property and later returned to the owner.

Scheller told ABC News that Van Winkle was cooperating with investigators.

A rep for Van Winkle did not respond to a request for comment.

Van Winkle, who is perhaps best known for his hit song, ""Ice Ice Baby,"" has a home renovation show on the DIY Network, ""The Vanilla Ice Project.

It was unclear whether this property is affiliated with the show."

“The largest treasure of gold coins discovered in Israel was found in recent weeks on the seabed in the ancient harbor in Caesarea,” Israel's Antiquities Authority said in a statement.

The authority said 2,000 gold coins were discovered by chance off the northern coastal city when members of a diving club stumbled upon them and informed the Antiquities Authority's marine division.

“At first, they thought they had spotted a toy coin from a game,"" the authority's statement said. ""It was only after they understood the coin was the real thing that they collected several coins and quickly returned to the shore in order to inform the director of the dive club about their find.”

Using metal detectors, the 2,000 coins were brought to the surface, weighing in at just more than 13 pounds. Experts believe the coins belonged to the Fatimid Caliphate, which ruled much of the Middle East and North Africa from 909 to 1171.

The earliest coin was minted in Palermo, Sicily in the second half of the 9th century.

Given the possibility of more buried coins in the area, archaeologists have launched further excavations.

“I’ve been working at the authority for 23 years and I’ve never seen a cache this size,"" Antiquities Authority coin expert Robert Kool told Haaretz.

Johnson and Reggie Johnson, 29, were passengers in the Jeep, per the sheriff's office. The latter Johnson suffered gunshot wounds to his shoulder, hand and leg. He, too, is in stable condition.

No arrests have been made in what police are calling a homicide investigation.

According to a police report, deputies arrived at the scene to find a Jeep with one deceased man and two others with gunshot wounds on the sidewalk. The victims said an unknown vehicle pulled up beside them at a red light and opened fire.

The sheriff's office said no further information will be released at this time.

""Our thoughts and prayers are with Chris and everyone impacted by this tragic event,"" the Jets said in a statement.

Chris Johnson, 29, is poised to become a free agent Tuesday. After one season with the Jets, the team declined last month to exercise an option for 2015, setting him free. Johnson blasted the Jets' previous management team in a radio interview, saying it lied to him about his role within the offense.

This marks his second off-the-field incident this offseason. In January, he was arrested in Orlando -- his hometown -- and charged with the open carrying of a firearm, a second-degree misdemeanor. According to police, Johnson was stopped after rolling through a stop sign. Upon approaching the car, an officer noticed the handle of a handgun on the floor between two seats. Johnson was released on $250 bond.

Johnson is coming off the most frustrating year of his career. In his first season with the Jets, he recorded career lows in carries (155), rushing yards (663) and rushing touchdowns (one).

The former Titans star, released by Tennessee in April, signed a two-year, $8 million contract with the Jets but never ascended into a starting role, as he split time with Chris Ivory.

With 8,628 yards, Johnson is the fifth-leading active rusher in the NFL. He is one of only seven players to rush for 2,000 yards in a season."

The delayed execution comes as prisons have faced increased scrutiny over lethal injection procedures. Some drugs traditionally used in lethal injections have become scarce as suppliers have refused to allow the drugs to be used in executions.

That this particular drug, pentobarbital, as reported by The Associated Press, was cloudy could indicate it was contaminated or a particulate ingredient did not fully disintegrate, Dr. Howard Nearman, an anesthesiologist at University Hospitals Case Medical Center in Cleveland, told ABC News today.

Pentobarbital is a sedative that causes brain sedation and can lead to coma and in cases of overdose, respiratory arrest.

Nearman, who had no involvement in this case, said he was also concerned that the people administering the drugs could lack necessary medical expertise, noting the correct dose of a sedative can be difficult to administer correctly.

“The trouble is there’s tremendous variability depending on what drug level is enough,” he said.

Certified anesthesiologists risk losing their certification if they consult or participate in an execution, according to a 2010 notice from the American Board of Anesthesiologists.

Kelly Gissendaner was scheduled to be the first Georgia woman in decades to be executed by lethal injection, in this case with pentobarbital, before the execution was postponed. Gissendaner was sentenced to death after being convicted of her husband’s murder in 1997.

Gwendolyn Hogan, a spokeswoman for the Georgia Department of Corrections, said the drug was tested earlier in the day and found to be acceptable, according to The Associated Press.

“Within the hours leading up to the execution, the execution team performed the necessary checks. At that time, the drug appeared cloudy,” Hogan told reporters Monday night, explaining the execution was postponed. “Out of an abundance of caution.”

In the past, Georgia has used drugs from compounding pharmacies that produce these drugs for lethal injections, according to The Associated Press. Multiple calls to the Georgia Department of Corrections to verify this information were not immediately returned.

The Associated Press has contributed to this report."
1AwgfIu,2015-02-13 00:00:00,Why Some Native Americans Say Facebook Is Bias Against Them - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/native-americans-petition-facebook-cease-deactivations-names/story?id=28921793,"There's a message many Native Americans have been getting from Facebook because their accounts were reported for having a fake name and thus deactivated. The message reads: ""It looks like that name violates our name standards.""

And many feel it's a subtle form of racism and marginalization that may not be intentional but needs to be fixed, Vienna Elk Looks Back told ABC News.

Elk Looks Back is Sicangu Lakota, a member of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe in South Dakota, and mother of four and grandmother of five. She said her account was reported and deactivated earlier this month.

""It's very upsetting to me,"" Elk Looks Back said. ""I feel this is harassment and another form of racism us Native Americans are facing, especially considering there are a lot of actual fake accounts, but here we are being targeted for our real names.""

Elk Looks Back's account was suspended until she provided identification, she said, adding she had to send them a photo I.D. and then a copy of her Social Security card. Her account was reactivated 12 hours later when she received a confirmation and brief apology from Facebook via email.

The identity confirmation process can be tedious and also brings up concerns about privacy, said Dana Lone Hill. She is another Native American woman whose account was deactivated when she tried to change her last name to ""Lone Elk"" to preserve her father's last name and Lakota identity, Lone Hill told ABC News.

""It seems so sketchy, and I didn't feel comfortable sending some of the stuff,"" Lone Hill said. ""Facebook already feels so creepy. They have facial recognition software that suggests who to tag in photos, and it's hard to trust them with all your information.""

""I don't want to have to prove who I am,"" Lone Hill said. ""Katy Perry's 'Left Shark' has a page. It just seems like they could go after fake accounts instead of kicking Native Americans off who are real.""

We are 1% of the population of our native homeland. We have no choice but to be loud and you will hear us. @lastrealindians #LRIism

Lone Hill's account was deactivated for a week this month before she finally got access back, she said.

Both Elk Looks Back and Lone Hill signed an online petition asking Facebook to allow them to use their native names. The petition has over 12,500 supporters.

A Facebook spokesperson told ABC News that the company is aware of many Native Americans' concerns and is working hard to resolve the issue.

“We are committed to ensuring that all members of the Facebook community can use the authentic names that they use in real life,"" the Facebook spokesperson said. ""Having people use their authentic names makes them more accountable, and also helps us root out accounts created for malicious purposes, like harassment, fraud, impersonation and hate speech.""

""We have more work to do, and our teams will continue to prioritize these improvements so everyone can be their authentic self on Facebook,"" the spokesperson said.

A man in Ohio, who also said his account was deactivated over his name, added that he felt the language in Facebook's message prompts were marginalizing and subtly upheld racism even if it wasn't the company's intention.

""As I was trying to put my real name in and reestablish my account, I kept getting messages that said 'This name doesn't meet Facebook's standards,'"" Shane Creepingbear told ABC News. Creepingbear is an assistant director of admission and multicultural recruitment at Antioch College and is a member of the Kiowa tribe of Oklahoma.

Try again @Creepingbear apparently my family name does not meet @facebook standards. Way to go #ColumbusDay #facebook pic.twitter.com/HYiu55DYgh

Adding insult to injury, his account was deactivated on Columbus Day, Creepingbear said.

""While I'm sure Facebook didn't mean to marginalize Native Americans, the messages I was getting reinforced the idea our names and personalities don’t meet the U.S.' 'standards,'"" he said. ""It's a subtle way of excluding us, and we already have a long history of erasure and racism against us in this country.""

He eventually got his account back up, and a personal apology, but Creepingbear said he hopes Facebook offers a more public apology to Native Americans such as one last October addressed to drag queens who had similar issues not being able to use the names they use in their daily lives.

""The spirit of our policy is that everyone on Facebook uses the authentic name they use in real life,"" Facebook's chief product officer Chris Cox wrote in October. ""For Sister Roma, that's Sister Roma. For Lil Miss Hot Mess, that's Lil Miss Hot Mess."""

Nine buildings in downtown Grantville, Georgia, 35 miles outside of Atlanta, are now collectively on auction on eBay.

The historic area has been a set for several recent movies -- including ""Lawless"" with Shia LaBeouf and Jessica Chastain, ""The War"" with Kevin Costner and Elijah Wood and ""Dumb and Dumber To"" with Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels, former Grantsville mayor Jim Sells told ABC News today.

Sells bought the commercial properties when they were in foreclosure, he said.

""Scouts from the entertainment industry love the brick, 'old-town-square-type' buildings,"" he said. ""Downtown Grantville has an historic appeal. A lot of the buildings were built in the 1880s, and we have a railroad runs right through the heart of town.""

Four new movies, including the ""The Ring 3"" and ""83 Days"" with big name stars Tom Cruise, Bryan Cranston and Danny Glover, just contacted him to shoot in area, he added.

""I would love to see a movie studio or a commercial developer buy it and get everything rented out,"" Sells said. ""It's dirt cheap at about $30 per square foot, and we've done all the dirty work by renovating everything.""

The town died down after after the textile mills closed during the recession, Sells said.

Now, most of downtown Grantville's revenue comes from tourists from all over the globe to tour the site that's been popular with the entertainment industry, he added.

""There is so much potential for revenue with buses of tourists coming in and our commuter residents who'd like to see more local business,"" Sells said.

The nine buildings up for sale, which include about 20,000 to 25,000 square feet of usable space in total, can developed into retail areas, loft apartments, bars or pubs, restaurants, pharmacies or office spaces, Sells said. Property tours are held everyday at 2 p.m., he added.

As of this morning, 194 eBay users had the listing on their watch list, though none have made an offer yet for the vacant commercial lot on auction for the starting price of $680,000.

""We've gotten several curious calls, but we're still hoping for a serious buyer,"" Sells said. ""This is a huge opportunity for someone to own a piece of history and revitalize a town with great potential."""

""I still see it. I still see it in the Republican Party and I still see it in other parts of our country. You don't have to be a Republican to be touched by this dark vein,"" Powell told ABC's George Stephanopoulos Sunday on ""This Week.""

""We've come a long way, but there's a long way to go. And we have to change the hearts and minds of Americans. And I see progress, especially in the younger generation,"" Powell added.

President Obama, along with former President George W. Bush, was in Selma Saturday to mark the anniversary of the seminal moment in the civil rights movement. They were joined by Rep. John Lewis, D-Georgia, who was brutally beaten during the march out of Selma that day in 1965.

""What that bloody Sunday event did for the nation was to hold up a mirror in front of all Americans and said, 'Look, this is what's going on in this country. This cannot continue,'"" Powell said.

Powell also echoed one of the theme's of Obama's speech in Selma, noting that while progress has been made on race relations, the ""march is not yet over.""

""We've made enormous progress. If we hadn't made progress, [President Obama] wouldn't have been standing there, Eric Holder wouldn't have been with him and I wouldn't be here right now,"" Powell said.

""But we still now have hurdles that we have to get over,"" Powell added, noting the battle in some states over voter identification laws.

The former secretary of state also weighed in on the Justice Department report released this week that found systemic discrimination against African-Americans by the police department in Ferguson, Missouri.

Powell said he was ""shocked"" by the report, but was not taken completely off guard.

""I was shocked but not that surprised, frankly, George. I know these things have existed in other parts of our country. This shouldn't have been that great a surprise to any of us. But it's not throughout the country,"" Powell said.

During the interview on ""This Week,"" Powell declined to comment directly on the controversy that has engulfed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton following revelations she used a private email account while she headed the State Department.

""I can't speak to Mrs. Clinton and what she should do now. That would be inappropriate,"" said Powell, who helped modernize the State Department through new computers and early use of e-mail during his time as secretary of state.

""In order to change the culture, to change the brainware, as I call it, I started using it in order to get everybody to use it, so we could be a 21st century institution and not a 19th century,"" Powell said of his own e-mail practices. ""But I retained none of those e-mails and we are working with the State Department to see if there's anything else they want to discuss with me about those e-mails."""

Wearing a puffy vest over a long plaid shirt and leggings, Leah walked the stage with a guitar and a smile, posing with her hand on her hip when she reached the end of the runway at Lincoln Center for Nike Levi's Kids Rock show, according to the Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week blog.

Devon Still gushed on Twitter that Leah was ""a natural."" He, too, was wearing plaid and a vest, and said Leah was ""trying to match [his] style.""

Still, 25, a defensive tackle, had originally been cut from the Bengals roster, but once the team learned his daughter had stage 4 cancer, they resigned him to their practice squad. He has since been placed on the active roster.

Leah underwent surgery and chemotherapy after doctors found a cancerous growth in her abdomen in June, according to The Associated Press.

Jurors in Westchester County deliberated for over three days before finding Lacey Spears, 27, guilty.

She will be sentenced April 8. Spears faces a maximum sentence of twenty five years to life in prison

Garnett Spears was taken to the hospital in January 2014 for an unexplained, and extremely dangerous level of sodium in his system. He died several days later.

Five months after the boy’s death, Lacey Spears, of Kentucky, surrendered to police. She pleaded not guilty at the time.

“Throughout his five years, Garnett Spears was forced to suffer through repeated hospitalizations, unneeded surgical procedures and ultimately poisoning with salt, all at the hands of the one person who should have been his ultimate protector: his mother. Using the child’s 'illnesses' to self aggrandize herself, her actions directly lead to her son’s tortured death. We will continue to ensure that his mother is held accountable and that justice for Garnett Spears will be served in his memory,” said Westchester DA Janet DiFiore.

The defense blamed the hospital for the boy’s death, but prosecutors said there was no explanation other than the mother’s deliberate introduction of salt into his feeding tube.

During a 14-day trial, prosecutors said Spears did it for attention. She had posted frequently to Facebook about her son’s health problems."

Rumors have been circulating for years surrounding the death of the infamous outlaw from the 1800s, and historian Robert Stahl has filed a petition at a district court in Fort Sumner a to make the death date official.

Stahl believes that Billy the Kid, the notorious bandit who had escaped from the Lincoln County Jail in New Mexico, was shot and killed the morning of July 15, 1881, in Fort Sumner, New Mexico, by Lincoln County Sheriff Pat Garrett.

In the 29-page petition, Stahl, a professor emeritus at Arizona State University, requests that the state of New Mexico issue a death certificate acknowledging July 15, 1881 as the death date and Garrett as the shooter.

""By us issuing a death certificate, especially with overwhelming evidence that he did in fact die, it would mean all of these people who are impostors couldn't have been Billy the Kid, because he died at about 12:30 a.m. on July 15, 1881,"" Stahl told ABC News today. ""There is overwhelming evidence. Too many people saw the body with the bullet.

""And the coroner's jury report not only identified the body as being that of Billy the Kid, but that he was shot by Pat Garrett,"" Stahl said.

Others claim that the outlaw didn't die at the hand of the sheriff and instead lived to be an old man. Several people over the years have claimed to be Billy the Kid. But according to Stahl, the state only ""didn't officially recognize the Kid died because they didn't create a death certificate.""

""Death certificates should be issued when somebody died,"" Stahl said. ""And the fact is, in territorial New Mexico at the time, death certificates were rarely issued and especially in rural areas. And we do know that Billy was killed because there is an official coroner's report. But even with that report, it was not a common practice to go and create a death certificate.""

A New Mexico judge is expected to schedule a hearing soon to make a decision."

John Kitzhaber has announced his resignation, the secretary of state, Kate Brown, will replace him and become the first openly bisexual governor in the United States.

Brown wrote a short piece about coming out as bisexual while serving in the state House of Representatives in 1992.

“It wasn’t until it was written in the Oregonian newspaper that I was bisexual that I had to face the inevitable and let those around me know. Thus began my very public coming out as a bisexual,” she wrote in an essay for “Out and Elected in the USA,” an online compendium of the stories of LGBT public officials from 1974 to 2004.

First, she informed her parents, who told her, “It would be much easier for us if you were a lesbian.” Her gay friends called her “half-queer.” And she also told her straight friends, “who never thought I could make up my mind about anything anyway.”

She said she came out to her legislative colleagues “most frighteningly” and shared this anecdote in her essay: “At the beginning of the next legislative session sitting in the House lounge, representative Bill Markham, who is over 70 years old, extremely conservative, and a legislator for more than 20 years comes to join me. Over lunch he looks up to say, ‘Read in the Oregonian a few months ago you were bisexual. Guess that means I still have a chance?!’”

The Bay Area Reporter recounted a campaign trip she made to San Francisco in November 2007 when she was a state senator campaigning for secretary of state along with Annise Parker, now the first openly gay mayor elected to run one of the nation’s largest cities -- Houston.

The Reporter quoted Brown as saying, during a Gay and Lesbian Victory Fund event, ""I'd be the first LGBT candidate elected to the second-highest office in the state.”

""I have been receiving checks in the mail from all over the country. To have that support from the national LGBT community is really wonderful and exciting,"" she added at the time.

Brown married her husband, Dan, in 1997 and has two stepchildren."

But in an interview with the Hollywood Reporter posted today, Winfrey revealed Harpo Studios in Chicago will be shut down by year's end in favor of a transition to OWN headquarters in L.A. This move ends Harpo's 26-year run in the Windy City.

OWN just moved into its new space at West Hollywood's The Lot.

""I've spent more hours in this building than I have any other building on Earth. ... We were here when there was nothing but hoes and rats on the street, and now it's one of the hottest neighborhoods [in Chicago],"" she told the magazine.

The talk-show host and actress, 61, added: ""The time had come to downsize this part of the business and to move forward. It will be sad to say goodbye, but I look ahead with such a knowing that what the future holds is even more than I can see.""

Winfrey noted that top OWN execs had been going back and forth between Chicago and Los Angeles and that she wanted all her operations in one place. OWN has been around for the past four years and plans to expand further.

Around 200 employees will be impacted by the closing of the Chicago offices. The report adds that a ""small group"" of Chicago employees will join OWN.

The interview also notes that Winfrey will soon see how much time she has to get back in front of the camera on the big screen, including an upcoming Richard Pryor biopic. As for Broadway rumors, Winfrey told the magazine she decided to stay away due to the morbid nature of the play ""night, Mother.""

Dozens of friends and family came dressed in costumes of their favorite comic book characters, Chris' wife, Jackie Kmetz, told ABC News today.

Jackie dressed up as Wonder Woman while her kids dressed up as a little Superboy and Supergirl. Even villains like Poison Ivy from ""Batman"" and characters from other fandoms like ""Star Wars"" came out to celebrate, Jackie said.

""We wanted to have a fun, kid-friendly celebration for my two little ones to remember their dad,"" Jackie said of her two children, ages 2 and 4. ""I was so thrilled. It was the exact kind of party he would have loved.""

Chris, 41, died last month after a car accident, leaving behind two kids but saving two lives through organs he donated just hours after his death, his wife said.

""In true superhero fashion, Chris passed away, but he saved two lives after donating his kidneys,"" Jackie told ABC News last month.

Jackie tried to include everything Chris loved in the celebration of his life, she said.

The auditorium was decorated with Superman-colored balloons. There was even a popcorn machine, a cotton candy machine and a video game corner with car racing games.

""The place was a good representation of what my husband was all about,"" Jackie said. ""It was so much fun and there were lots smiles and laughter just as Chris would've wanted.""

A few tears were shed, however, during a slideshow presentation remembering Chris' life, Jackie said.

""There were all these pictures of him being goofy, and you could just see how he was our family's hero,"" Jackie said. ""After the slideshow, we had an open mic where lots of family and friends shared good memories of Chris.""

Guests also record a message to Jackie's kids in a ""video interview corner"" Jackie set up, she said.

""I'm not sure how much they understand now given their young age, but when they're older, they can watch these videos and learn more about their amazing dad from everyone he touched,"" Jackie said."

""It was bittersweet experience,"" family friend and UDel doctoral student Michael Emmons told ABC News today. ""The photos won't bring back Ricky and Traci's children and Ricky's mom, but it's powerful that they're able to save these memories.""

Emmons discovered the damaged photos laid out in Ricky's garage while on his way to pay his condolences last December, he said.

The hundreds of photos were charred, covered in soot and stained by the water used to fight the blaze that took the lives of 60-year-old Terry Harris and her grandsons Kenyon, 14, Broderick, 11, and Braylon, 9.

Emmons then contacted Debra Hess Norris, chairman of UDel's art conservation department and photo conservation professor, asking if she knew of any way to help restore the photos for the Harris family.

Coincidentally, Norris was prepping for a photo conservation class, Emmons said, and she switched out her original class project plans to help the Harris family, using their photos for the class project instead.

The students worked late nights and weekends to restore every photograph one-by-one, Norris told ABC News today.

""It was a labor of love on the part of everyone,"" Norris said. ""The project was such a great example of why preservation of cultural heritage is so important. Just seeing the memories they contain, it was a very moving and real affirmation as to why we're involved in this field.""

The photographs included both black-and-white and color portraits, Polaroids, and photo booth prints and snapshots, Norris said.

Every image was treated differently according to its particular damage, she added.

""At times, many of us were in tears,"" Norris said. ""We felt a strong personal connection to the images.""

Norris flew to Ohio with Emmons to personally deliver the photos at a community gathering held at a local youth recreational center, she said.

Ricky and Traci said they were very grateful for the photos and the work students did to restore them, but it's difficult to see the people they can no longer hug in person.

""When I look in their eyes in those pictures, you see them like physically, like I am looking at you guys, I can grab you guys, but I can't grab them,"" Ricky told ABC News affiliate WSYX.

ABC News' attempts to contact Ricky and Traci for additional comment were unsuccessful.

The cause of the blaze hasn't been determined yet, the the state fire marshal's office said Friday, WSYX reported, but Ricky said he thinks a propane gas leak started the fire.

The fire destroyed the house and its contents, but the photographs were discovered in a tub, charred and wet, WSYX added."

The LAPD had identified the man as Charley Saturmin Robinet, a convicted bank robber who carried a French passport.

But Astrid le Moine, Press Attaché for the Consulate General of France in Los Angeles, said the French consulate later notified police of the usage of the stolen identity.

Arnaud Guillois, the press counselor at the French Embassy in Washington, told ABC News that the homeless man killed on Skid Row ""is not French."" French officials do not know the man's nationality at this time, Guillois said.

A call to the LAPD Tuesday seeking comment wasn't immediately returned.

Court documents confirm that the man who used the name Charley Saturmin Robinet was released from federal prison on May 12, 2014 after serving 14 years in prison. According to the Associated Press, the 2000 incident involved Robinet holding up a Wells Fargo to steal money to pay for acting classes.

A law enforcement source confirmed to ABC News that Robinet was 39 at the time of his death.

A 2005 court document notes that a state psychiatrist examined him and determined that he had a ""mental disorder or defect"" but it was unclear if he received treatment.

Witnesses at the shooting scene told KABC that the man was called ""Africa"" by people who knew him. The shooting took place on the city's Skid Row, a stretch of Central Los Angeles where many of the city's homeless congregate.

Footage obtained by ABC News shows Robinet entering his tent on the sidewalk shortly before police arrive at the scene.

At least two investigations into the shooting are underway."

But unless you are a national security wonk, the odds are that you will not be familiar with the term or its acronym, AUMF.

WHAT IS THE AUMF?

AUMF is the acronym for Authorization for the Use of Military Force. The specific AUMF that Congress will debate will provide the legal authorization for the U.S. military to fight ISIS.

HOW DO YOU PRONOUNCE IT?

You pronounce every letter in the acronym, unlike other acronyms like NASA.

WHY DO YOU NEED AN AUMF?

The War Powers Resolution of 1973 requires the president to notify Congress within 48 hours of ordering U.S. armed forces for a military operation overseas. Those forces cannot operate in a deployed status for more than 60 days. Combat military operations lasting longer than that time frame require a congressional declaration of war or an authorized use of military force. American airstrikes against ISIS began on Aug. 8 and an airstrike campaign in Syria began on Sept. 22. Since then the U.S. has launched 1,900 of the 2,360 coalition airstrikes in both Iraq and Syria.

WHY DO YOU NEED AN AUMF AGAINST ISIS?

Since the start of the airstrike campaign against ISIS, the Obama administration has relied on the AUMF’s from 2001 and 2002 as the legal justification for its airstrikes against ISIS.

The 2001 AUMF passed by Congress in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks authorized “appropriate force” against terrorists who “planned, authorized, committed or aided"" the attacks. That AUMF has been used as the legal justification for American military action against al-Qaeda terrorists anywhere in the world. The 2002 AUMF authorized the use of military force against Saddam Hussein’s Iraq. It is ironic that the administration is relying partially on the 2001 AUMF since in 2013 President Obama said he favored refining the AUMF and ultimately repealing the “AUMF’s mandate.”

WHAT IS IN THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION’S PROPOSED AUMF?

For months there has been bipartisan congressional support for an ISIS-specific AUMF. However, some key members of Congress have wanted the Obama administration to take the lead in proposing what should be in a new AUMF.

The AUMF proposed by the Obama administration contains several main points. It would authorize military operations against ISIS for three years, allow for the limited use of ground troops by not authorizing ""enduring offensive ground combat operations."" It would also repeal the 2002 AUMF that authorized the ground invasion in Iraq, and provide reports every six months on the pace of operations.

The draft language authorizes President Obama ""to use the Armed Forces of the United States as the President determines to be necessary and appropriate against ISIL or associated persons or forces."" It also describes ISIL, also known as ISIS, as a terrorist organization that poses a ""grave threat"" to the U.S. and its allies in the Middle East.

AREN’T THERE ALREADY US TROOPS IN IRAQ?

There are currently 2,630 U.S. military personnel in Iraq. Last summer, the Obama administration sent American troops to Baghdad to augment security at the U.S. embassy as well as a small number of advisers to help the Iraqi military halt ISIS’s advance towards the Iraqi capital.

Since then the White House has authorized the presence in Iraq of as many as 3,100 U.S. military personnel to provide security to American facilities and launch a training and advise mission for the Iraqi military. The Obama administration has repeatedly stated that U.S. personnel sent to Iraq are not combat “boots on the ground” because they will not see frontline combat with Iraqi units. However, senior military commanders have said publicly that Joint Terminal Air Controllers (JTAC’s) may end up paired with Iraqi units to call in airstrikes in complex military operations. The proposed AUMF would enable this limited use of ground forces.

WHY FOR ONLY THREE YEARS?

The proposed AUMF would last only three years. U.S. military officials have projected that the fight against ISIS could take several years, a minimum of three years. This is how long it would take to retrain the Iraqi military so it can defeat ISIS in Iraq as well as train a force of Syrian moderate opposition fighters who could take the fight to ISIS in Syria.

But there is also a political component too as there has been congressional and administration criticism that the 2001 AUMF was too open-ended. Renewing the AUMF three years from now would allow a public debate on how much longer the fight against ISIS should last.

WHAT HAS BEEN THE EARLY REACTION ON CAPITOL HILL?
President Obama’s request is being met with early resistance on Capitol Hill, with critical questions and deep concern from Democrats and Republicans alike. No surprise, given the fierce partisan divide and the hangover of more than a decade of war. Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia and other Democrats say they are troubled by the “breadth and vagueness” of the language involving ground troops. Kaine and others believe there is too much room for mission creep and say they would not support the proposal as it is now. Sen. John McCain and other Republicans say the president’s proposal has the opposite problem: It constricts the commander-in-chief’s flexibility. McCain, Sen. Lindsey Graham and others say they would not support the proposal as it is now. At issue is the interpretation of these five words, which would be prohibited in the AUMF: “enduring offensive ground combat operations.”

HOW LONG WILL THE CONGRESSIONAL DEBATE LAST?
It will certainly last weeks, but could stretch into months.

SO, WHAT’S THE BOTTOM LINE – WILL THE AUMF PASS OR FAIL?
It’s far too early to suggest the authorization will fail. But if it does, the White House has a backup plan: The proposal only seeks to repeal the 2002 AUMF, the original one passed by Congress in 2001 targeting Al Qaeda is still in place and is the basis for the fight already underway against ISIS.

According to the Times, Clinton did not have a government email address during her four years at the State Department, and her aides took no action to preserve her emails – which is required by law under the Federal Records Act.

Clinton's personal spokesman, Nick Merrill, issued a statement in response to the New York Times report.

""Like Secretaries of State before her, she used her own email account when engaging with any Department officials. For government business, she emailed them on their Department accounts, with every expectation they would be retained. When the Department asked former Secretaries last year for help ensuring their emails were in fact retained, we immediately said yes,"" the statement reads.

""Both the letter and spirit of the rules permitted State Department officials to use non-government email, as long as appropriate records were preserved. As a result of State¹s request for our help to make sure they in fact were, that is what happened here. As the Department stated, it is in the process of updating its record preservation policies to bring them in line with its retention responsibilities.""

In an effort to comply with federal record-keeping laws, aides to the former secretary of state turned over 55,000 emails to the State Department two months ago, according to the Times report.

""The State Department has long had access to a wide array of Secretary Clinton's records – including emails between her and Department officials with state.gov accounts. Last year, the Department sent a letter to representatives of former secretaries of state requesting they submit any records in their possession for proper preservation as part of our effort to continually improve our records preservation and management,"" State Department Deputy Spokesperson Marie Harf told ABC News in a statement early Tuesday. ""In response to our request, Secretary Clinton provided the Department with emails spanning her time at the Department. After the State Department reviewed those emails, last month the State Department produced about 300 emails responsive to recent requests from the Select Committee.""

""From the moment that the Select Committee was created, the State Department has been proactively and consistently engaged in responding to the Committee's many requests in a timely manner, providing more than 40,000 pages of documents, scheduling more than 20 transcribed interviews and participating in several briefings and each of the Committee's hearings,"" the statement continued.

The State Department also says they are in the process of updating their records preservation policies to bring them up to speed with 2013 National Archives and Records Administration guidance. ""These steps include regularly archiving all of Secretary Kerry's emails to ensure that we are capturing all federal records,"" Harf said.

Kerry is the first secretary of state to rely primarily on a state.gov email account.

The matter is expected to become a campaign issue. Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, a potential 2016 candidate for the White House, released more than 275,000 emails last month from his time as governor in the name of ""transparency."" Bush tweeted late Monday ""Transparency matters. Unclassified @HillaryClinton emails should be released. You can see mine, here. Jebbushemails.com.""

Transparency matters. Unclassified @HillaryClinton emails should be released. You can see mine, here. http://t.co/wZbtwd8O2j

Senior administration officials declined to comment late Monday on whether any other cabinet member or senior staffer operated without a government email account in the Obama administration, or whether steps are now being taken to ensure the Federal Records Act is being followed with in Clinton's case. Senior administration officials also will not say whether any White House officials corresponded with Clinton on that account on official business and whether they had security concerns about emailing a non-government account.

In the suit, which Nina Pham plans to file Monday, the 26-year-old nurse alleges that Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital didn't train the staff to treat Ebola and didn't give them proper protective gear, which left parts of their skin exposed, her lawyer Charla Aldous said.

""One of the most concerning things about the way [the hospital] handled this entire process is you've got a young lady who has this disease which she should not have. And if they properly trained her and given her the proper personal protective equipment to wear, she would not have gotten the disease,"" Aldous said.

""This is not something that Nina chose,"" Aldous said, but ""She's hoping that through this lawsuit she can make it a change for the better for all nurses.""

Pham is still coping with Ebola's after-effects, including nightmares and body aches, her lawyer said.

""She has not gone back to work yet and she is working on recovering,"" Aldous said. ""I don't know if she'll ever be a nurse again.""

Texas Health Resources spokesperson Wendell Watson said in a statement: ""Nina Pham bravely served Texas Health Dallas during a most difficult time. We continue to support and wish the best for her, and we remain optimistic that constructive dialogue can resolve this matter.""

Last fall, Pham cared for Liberian native Thomas Eric Duncan, who flew to the U.S. and was diagnosed with Ebola at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital.

Pham took care of Duncan when he was especially contagious, and on Oct. 8, Duncan died from the virus.

Pham tested positive for Ebola on Oct. 11, marking the first Ebola transmission on U.S. soil.

On Oct. 16, Pham was transferred to the National Institutes of Health's hospital in Bethesda, Maryland. She was discharged on Oct. 24.

At the news conference announcing Pham's discharge, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the NIH, said she tested negative for Ebola five times, and that it wasn't clear which treatment saved her because they were all experimental.

""I want to first tell you what a great pleasure and in many respects, a privilege ... to have the opportunity to treat and care for and get to know such an extremely courageous and lovely person,"" Fauci said, adding that she represents the health care workers who ""put themselves on the line.""

Pham's dog, Bentley, was also quarantined for several weeks, over fears that he, too, would develop Ebola.

Far from fiction, the health problems they portray are very real issues for millions of Americans. Here, the health conditions now in the spotlight explained.

Still Alice

In “Still Alice” Julianne Moore plays a college professor robbed of her intellect, vocabulary and even her ability to recognize her family by early-onset Alzheimer’s disease. The devastating disease affects an estimated 200,000 people in the U.S., mainly striking people in their 40s and 50s, according to the Alzheimer’s Association.

The Theory of Everything

""The Theory of Everything"" tells the story of real-life physicist Stephen Hawking, who has lived with the debilitating disease ALS most of his life.

ALS, short for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and often referred to as Lou Gehrig's Disease, is caused by a progressive degeneration of motor neurons, the cells responsible for movement. When the motor neurons die, the ability of the brain to initiate and control muscle movement is lost and the patient ultimately becomes totally paralyzed, according to the ALS Association.

ALS awareness is at an all-time high thanks to this movie and last summer’s ice bucket challenge.

Wild

After her mother dies, Cheryl Strayed (played by Reese Witherspoon) embarks on a mission of self-destruction that eventually busts up her marriage. She impulsively decides to trek more than a thousand miles of the Pacific Crest Trail -- alone -- which ultimately becomes a journey of enlightenment.

Strayed, whose memoir the movie is based on, has said her actions were the result of a clinical depression. Her behavior is consistent with the American Psychological Association's list of depression symptoms: insomnia, listlessness, feelings of worthlessness, erratic behavior and suicidal thoughts.

While the isolation of hitting the trail solo could have worsened her symptoms, regular exercise has been shown to boost mood and lift depression, according to the APA.

In the film version, Laura Dern plays Strayed's mother, who succumbs to lung cancer just months after being diagnosed.

In real life, lung cancer is the most deadly cancer for both men and women in the U.S., according to the American Lung Association. More women live with the disease than men, but more men are diagnosed with lung cancer every year.

Half of those diagnosed with lung cancer will die within one year of their diagnosis. Over the last 37 years, the rates of lung cancer cases have decreased for men by 28 percent, but risen for women by 98 percent, according to the American Lung Association.

The Imitation Game

In “The Imitation Game,” Benedict Cumberbatch plays renowned mathematician and World War II code-breaker Alan Turing. After the war, he was arrested and “chemically castrated” for homosexual activity by the British government.

In 1952, Turing was faced with a choice of prison or being given a series of injections of female hormones -- that is, being chemically castrated -- after his arrest for what the government at the time deemed ""gross indecency."" The shots were aimed at decreasing sex drive, although the BBC reported in 2012 that Turing mentioned it made him grow breasts. The famed code-breaker died two years later, in a reported suicide.

Turning was given a posthumous royal pardon in 2013."

Anyone who's seen the images expresses jaw dropping shock and disbelief. Is this really happening in 2015 -- fifty years after the bloody Sunday march in Selma, Alabama, commemorated just days ago?

For many of us that celebration of hatred belted out by brothers of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity at the University of Oklahoma is a stunningly familiar moment. Though decked out in a tuxedo, apparently for some kind of beautiful occasion, the young ringleader and his fraternity brothers reveal an ugly truth about racial pain on college campuses. It's a stinging pain some of us are reliving at this moment, recalling long buried memories of how our innocence was shattered at the very place we had hoped to feel safe and nurtured. l am among those dealing with an old demon of racial bias while away at college.

Though I had grown up in the segregated South, just a couple hundred miles from UGA, oddly I had a carefree, rather idyllic school history. I was a cheerleader, a choral member and participated in a number of academic clubs. Believe it or not, I'd never personally felt the sting of a racial slur. Not that the language of hateful prejudice didn't exist in my town or at my high school, but I never experienced it. So I was utterly unprepared for this day at UGA. Walking down the sidewalk when a car of rowdy kids passed me and hissed that ""preppy clothes are cool but not on a n-----.""

The word was casual yet filled with daggers.

I stopped dead in my tracks as the car sped away. My heart raced and my eyes stung with tears.

Who could be so cruel? And why?

Suddenly, I was filled with fear and panic as I turned to run back to my dorm. I still feel that same hurt and shame that gripped me as walked back into the lobby, trembling with fear. I never told my roommate, who happened to be white, what had happened. I never told my parents either. I was too shaken and upset. As time went on, I buried the painful incident and chose to forget it. Overall, I had a happy experience at the school and look back on those years fondly.

As for the incident, I had mostly tucked it away in my mind until this week when the ignorant and cruel OU fraternity members reminded me -- and so many others -- of just how damaging racial bias can be. I hope that the incident, as disgusting as it may be, is a lesson to us all about how much work we have ahead of us if we want our children to sing new songs about tolerance and peace."

Photos from South Korea's official news agency show Mark Lippert with blood on his hand and holding his bleeding face. A man shouted ""No to war training!"" before attacking him, the Yonhap news agency reported.

The ambassador was slashed on the face and wrist by the man who was screaming that the rival Koreas should be unified, South Korean police said Thursday, according to the Associated Press. Lippert was attacked with a 10-inch fruit knife, police told ABC News. His assailant was arrested, according to Robert Ogburn, an official at the U.S. embassy in Seoul, who said the U.S. strongly condemned the ""senseless act of violence.""

The bacterium in question, burkholderia pseudomallei, is widespread throughout Southeast Asia and northern Australia, infecting humans and animals via contaminated soil and water entering the blood stream through cuts in the skin, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The high-security laboratory at the Tulane National Primate Research Center in Louisiana, which is studying the bacteria, reported that at least five rhesus macaques not used in studies were infected with the bug, possibly as early as November of last year, according to spokesman Michael Strecker.

How the bacteria made its way from the lab to animals not used in experiments is still an open question despite weeks of investigation by multiple federal and state agencies, including the CDC, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Environmental Protection Agency.

“The only connection among these four animals was their presence in the veterinary hospital during the same period of time,” Dr. Andrew A. Lackner, the director of the center, said in a statement last week, adding that more than 50 soil and water samples from the 500-acre compound have tested negative for the bacteria.

A federal investigator also tested positive for burkholderia, after visiting the center, Jason McDonald, a CDC spokesman, told ABC News. It isn't clear whether he was exposed to the bacteria at the primate center or during travel to an infected region, McDonald said.

However, Strecker said he did not believe the investigator came into contact with the germ at the center.

""At present there is no evidence of Burkholderia pseudomallei in any human or other non-human primate at the TNPRC,"" he told ABC News.

Though the CDC stressed that there is no risk to the general public, the agency said it has directed Tulane to suspend all research until the investigation is complete. The infected animals were euthanized, according to the Tulane statement.

“The veterinary hospital has been thoroughly disinfected, and additional animal testing is ongoing,” Lackner said in a statement. “Tulane continues to work with the CDC, USDA and the EPA, as well as state and local officials on this matter.”

Melioidosis causes fever, headache, loss of appetite, muscle and joint pain. Although full-blown illness from the bacteria is rare, the fatality rate is up to 50 percent in some countries for those who do get sick, studies show.

Also of concern: The bacterium has been studied for use as a potential bioweapon, according to the UPMC Center for Health Security, an independent biosecurity think tank."

Winning tickets were sold in North Carolina, Texas and Puerto Rico, matching the numbers 25, 11, 54, 13 and 39, with a Powerball of 19. At this point, none of the winners has emerged.

Another winning ticket was sold at Scotchman, a convenience store in Shallotte, North Carolina.

“We got a call from the lottery, and it’s exciting to be able to experience a customer of ours who has this life-changing experience,” said Rich Mione, the director of marketing at GPM Investments, which owns the store.

The third winning ticket was sold at a Shell gas station in Cotto Laurel in southern Puerto Rico, the U.S. territory’s first Powerball win after joining the lottery in October.

Should the winners select the lump-sum option, each would get one-third of $381,138,450.16 before taxes. The other option is an annuity, under which the lottery would make payments 30 times over 29 years. Additionally, stores that sell jackpot-winning tickets are slated to receive a cash payout.

Beyond the jackpot winners, 33 other tickets across 17 states matched five numbers, but missed the Powerball, for $1 million. New Hampshire resident Bob Wolak just missed matching the Powerball, but he says he’s content with his winnings.

“Of course you kick yourself – 18 [for the Powerball] and the winner was 19. But I’m happy with a million dollars,” Wolak said."

Craig Stephen Hicks, 46, was charged with three counts of first-degree murder and ordered held without bail Wednesday morning.

His wife, Karen Hicks, said she was shocked at the news of the event and that she believed the incident was not religiously motivated.

“We were married for seven years and that is one thing that I do know about him,"" Karen Hicks told reporters today. ""He often champions on his Facebook page for the rights of many individuals -- for same-sex marriages, abortion, race. He just believed -- I know that’s just one of the things I know about him is that everyone is just equal.”

Hicks' attorney Rob Maitland said his client had a ""longstanding issue"" with parking, saying, ""it has nothing to do with the religious faith"" of the victims.

“Unfortunately these victims were there at the wrong time at the wrong place,"" Maitland said.

""Our preliminary investigation indicates that the crime was motivated by an ongoing neighbor dispute over parking,"" Chapel Hill Police said in a statement. ""Hicks is cooperating with investigators and more information may be released at a later time.""

Police earlier said they were investigating whether the shooting was a hate crime. All three victims were Muslim.

Duke University’s Imam Abdullah Antepli said, “This may or may not be a hate crime,” adding that authorities have been “extremely helpful and supportive.”

U.S. Attorney in North Carolina Ripley Rand said, ""We don't have any information that this was a targeted campaign against Muslims in North Carolina.”

Two of the victims -- Deah Barakat, 23, a second-year student in UNC's School of Dentistry, and Yusor Mohammad, 21, a prospective dental student -- were married. Mohammad's sister, Razan Mohammad Abu-Salha, was a sophomore at North Carolina State University in Raleigh and was visiting her sister and brother-in-law, according to Deah Barakat's father.

Gunshots were reported after 5 p.m. Tuesday in the Finley Forest condominiums in Chapel Hill, east of the University of North Carolina campus.

Farris Barakat, Deah Barakat's brother, said Hicks had confronted his brother previously about a dispute over a parking space, adding that he never heard Hicks make any anti-Muslim remarks.

When Farris Barakat had visited his brother, Hicks had yelled at him, telling him he was parking in the wrong space, Farris Barakat told ABC News. Farris Barakat added that he tried to respond in a calm manner, not wanting to upset Hicks further, and said his brother also treated Hicks in a respectful manner.

Hicks showed up at Barakat and Mohammad's home in the past with a gun on his belt, and Mohammad had confided that she was afraid of Hicks, Farris Barakat said. The two joked that maybe she should get a gun, he added.

The nation's largest Muslim civil rights organization, The Council on American-Islamic Relations, requested law enforcement authorities address speculation about a possible bias motive in the homicide.

Information about the shooting was heavily shared on social media, fueling hashtags such as #MuslimLivesMatter and #ChapelHillShooting to trend across the United States."

A few days after the incident, the ""Lone Survivor"" actor checked himself into an alcohol rehabilitation facility, his spokesman, Robert Offer, told ABC News in a prepared statement. Offer added that Hirsch ""consumed an enormous amount of alcohol on the evening in question and he doesn't have any memory of what happened at the time of the allegations.""

The court document, filed by prosecutors and citing police reports, alleges that Hirsch choked a female studio executive and dragged her across a table on Jan. 25 at Tao Nightclub in Park City, Utah.

Hirsch is charged ""with aggravated assault, a third-degree felony, and intoxication, a class C misdemeanor,"" Summit County Prosecutor Ryan Stack told ABC News. The assault charge ""is punishable by up to five years in the Utah State Prison and a $5,000 fine,"" Stack said.

Police responded at around 3:52 a.m. to the nightclub and met with Daniele Bernfeld, the executive who reported she was assaulted by the ""Into the Wild"" actor, according to the document filed with Utah's Third District Court. She told police Hirsch, 29, approached her shortly after 3 a.m., appeared drunk and called her a ""rich kid.""

""Hirsch grabbed Bernfeld, but she pushed him away,"" the document said.

Bernfeld is an executive with Insurge Pictures, a company under the Paramount Pictures umbrella, according to The Associated Press.

After the actor moved away from Bernfeld to join friends at another table, he came back and ""wrapped his arm around her to put her in a chokehold,"" according to the prosecutors' court filing. ""Hirsch pulled Bernfeld across the table and onto the floor, where he landed on top of her.""

Bernfeld told investigators she may have momentarily blacked out after Hirsch ""wrapped his hands around her neck,"" according to the court filing. Two people at the club pulled the actor off Bernfeld, the document added.

A witness at a nearby table corroborated Bernfeld's account of the incident, and Park City Sgt. Jay Randall observed redness on her neck and chest, the court document said.

Police also spoke with the actor, who was not arrested but admitted to having ""three or four drinks"" and said he was in a ""verbal confrontation"" with Bernfeld, but didn't know her, the document noted.

""His balance was poor and he slurred some of his words,"" Randall said of Hirsch in the documents.

Neil Kaplan, an attorney for Hirsch, said he did not have any comment, but referred to a statement made by Offer.

""Emile takes these allegations very seriously, and is devastated that any of this has occurred,"" Offer said in the statement, which he released to ABC News. ""A few days after the incident, Emile sought help and checked himself into an alcohol rehabilitation facility, where he remains today, to ensure nothing like this ever happens again. Emile is continuing to cooperate fully with authorities.""

Insurge Pictures did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Bernfeld.

Hirsch’s first court date is scheduled for March 16."

The manatees were freed early Tuesday, Satellite Beach Fire Department Captain Jay Dragon told ABC News.

Crews from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission, the Satellite Beach Fire Department and Police Department and city utilities worked to access into the culverts where the marine mammals were trapped, so a five-member team from SeaWorld could lift them out and release them back into the water, officials said.

#BREAKING up close look at #manatee that was just freed from drain. #WFTV pic.twitter.com/mDBFsrksko

With rain in the forecast, there was concern that the animals stuck in the drain could drown if the culvert were to fill with water.

Manatees, which are very curious, occasionally swim into storm drains, but because the culvert gradually narrows, some larger animals can get wedged and stuck, according to Ann Spellman, a marine biologist with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission.

Even if only one gets physically wedged in the pipe, any others following it can't get out, because they cannot swim backwards and don't have room to turn around.

After the mass stranding was discovered Monday, the city installed grates on the mouth of the culverts in the area to prevent any other manatees from swimming in."

Thanks to erosion and volcanic eruption (natural occurrences we aren't usually thanking), the city is filled with beautiful rock formations, dubbed ""fairy chimneys"" for their surreal appearance. They kind of look like honeycombs these days, as over the centuries, locals have carved into the soft rock to form houses and churches, creating underground systems in the process. Hot air balloon rides are particularly popular in the area, as they give travelers a chance to see the amazing and well-preserved structures from a bird's eye view. For a truly unique experience, stay at one of the many cave hotels that have guest rooms carved into the rock. These 10 are some of the coolest you can book!

This sprawling hillside property made up of six stone buildings (and the caves beneath them) has stunning views of Pigeon Valley from its many terraces and courtyards, where guests can enjoy wine from the hotel's immense cellar. Rooms at Argos in Cappadocia have Turkish antiques lending a rich decorative element, wood-burning fireplaces, and access to outdoor courtyards or terraces. Suites have separate living areas with private terraces or balconies, and the Splendid Suites have their own private indoor pools carved into the cave floors. The all-stone bathrooms have large walk-in showers and heated towel racks.

One of the top hotels in Urgup, Kayakapi Premium Cavesis a hilltop property occupying 2,700 acres of a residential neighborhood composed of hundreds of long since abandoned cave homes and historical buildings. A full spa, outdoor pool, and two restaurants fill the unique stone interiors and gorgeous grounds here. With 32 rooms and counting, the hotel features large guest units, all of which are built into true historical caves. Each is unique and luxurious, carved into the rocky hillside with a separate living area and work desks. Elegant wooden furniture and colorful Turkish kilims are used sparingly, letting the stone spaces exude a natural Cappadocian ambiance. Some rooms have fireplaces, courtyards, or terraces, and a few spaces even have their own private cave pools.

Converted from nine abandoned cave houses and their neighboring fifth-century caves, Esbelli Evi Cave Hotel is a boutique with 10 suites and four standard rooms. It was the first hotel in Cappadocia, opening in 1990. The natural stones are the highlights of the rooms; each area is carved out individually to accommodate the bathrooms, doors, windows, and even closets -- no two rooms are the same. The larger suites have en-suite bedrooms and two additional day-beds in the separate living areas, separate kitchens, and marble bathrooms.

Designed for explorers who prefer a quiet and meditative space, the 35-room Gamirasu Cave Hotel is a stunning and romantic find in Ayvali Village. The property is a combination of converted village houses and a Byzantine-era monastery that now hosts a number of modern conveniences -- from a heated outdoor pool to free Wi-Fi -- but has retained historic details such as frescoes decorating the walls. Standard rooms have the basic beds and en-suite showers, while the larger suites have luxuriously decorated separate living areas and balconies with great views.

Anatolian Houses is an upscale, traditionally styled complex with 33 suites carved from ancient stone caves located in the center of Göreme town. The original architecture has been superbly maintained as has its wonderfully historic ambience, though with all the modern comforts you'd expect from a hotel of this caliber. The Roman spa is certainly impressive and the wine fountain is sure to appeal to many. All of the hotel's 33 suites are carved into rock in the Cappadocian style and retain much of their original elements -- including stone archways, carved wooden beams, and ancient alcoves. Local art pieces also decorate the stone walls, while modern amenities include minibars and flat-screen TVs with digital channels.

The 14-room Aydinli Cave House Hotel is a mid-range, family-run guesthouse set on a hillside overlooking Göreme town and the surrounding area. Friendly and accommodating service is a real highlight here, as is an excellent breakfast that can be taken on the panoramic terrace. Rooms are generally spacious with wonderful old stone walls, exposed wooden beams, and locally-sourced decorations and furnishings; they also feature furnished terraces and separate lounges with fireplaces. Bathrooms also tend to be relatively large with heated towel rails and plenty of toiletries -- many also come with bathtubs big enough for two.

The 21-room Traveller's Cave Hotel is one of the more smartly presented properties in Göreme, both inside and out, while retaining plenty of rustic charm. Rooms are particularly nicely finished, with comparatively clean lines and polished wooden floors -- mixed with traditional furnishings and Turkish rugs. In-room amenities are impressive, and include free Wi-Fi, mini-fridges, tea and coffee facilities, and flat-screen TVs with satellite (and English-speaking) channels. Bathrooms are also better than most in the area; many have hammam-style stone basins and whirlpool tubs, while most rooms also feature fireplaces.

Sultan Cave Suites, set about a 10-minute walk up a cobblestone street from the center of town, is fantastically terraced into the hillside, with stone patios facing multiple directions. Many of the 30 rooms here are carved directly into the surrounding rock, making for delightful features like curved walls and indentations that have been turned into functional sections. Doors and furnishings are made of substantial wood, and some rooms have skylights cut into the rock. With arched doorways as additional highlights, most units have a significant amount of sconce lighting, though spaces can still be a bit on the dark side.

The 36-room Cappadocia Cave Suites' main selling point is its excellent integration with the striking ""fairy chimneys"" the region is renowned for. The blend of these with ancient cave dwellings and modern stone buildings give a real feel of history throughout. There are a total of 36 rooms, of which 20 of them are rock-cut caves and 16 of them are stone-arched rooms. Each has different layout and variations in decor and furnishings, though all are decorated with a selection of local handicrafts and regional furnishings. They are well equipped with minibars, small flat-screen TVs, and (in most) nice soaking tubs.

This charming bed and breakfast enjoys fantastic views of the surrounding countryside and offers a plethora of romantic places to sit among stone terraces. Multiple guests have lauded the Elysee thanks in large part to the warmth of the owner and the willingness of the staff to help book travel and tourist activities. Guest rooms contain arched doorways that lend a particularly elegant feel to the spaces, and pale stone is handsomely set off by rough-hewn wood ceilings with large chunky crossbeams. The rooms need little decor to feel authentic, though there is the occasional decorative throw rug. Bathrooms are tiled in light brown and offer stalls with handheld showerheads."

Detroit born and bred. An Army veteran. And now he is a self-described ""Soldier of Christ"" back in Iraq, fighting ISIS on the front lines.

""People ask me, 'Why you?' I come back and I say, 'Why not? Why just me? Where's everyone else at?"" said Brett, who requested that ABC News not use his last name to protect his family back home.

""Jesus says, you know, 'What you do unto the least of them, you do unto me,'"" he added. ""I take that very seriously.""

Brett returned to Iraq six months ago. In 2006-07, he served in the infamous ""Triangle of Death,"" where he said he was badly wounded in an IED attack on his Humvee.

He came here, he told ABC News, to defend the defenseless -- to protect the Christians and others in this part of Iraq who have been terrorized by the ISIS onslaught: driven from their homes, massacred, their women and girls raped and sold into slavery.

He is of Irish and Polish descent, raised Roman Catholic and now describes himself simply as a Christian.

Brett fights alongside a small, local Christian militia -- the Dweikh Nawsha. They are under the command of Kurdish peshmerga forces in this part of Iraq.

From Brett's forward position, in the deserted Christian village of Bakufa, about eight miles from the outskirts of the city of Mosul in northern Iraq, you can see the black flags of ISIS whipping against the sky in a stiff winter wind.

We joined him there to hear his story."

The fox was spotted using motion-sensitive cameras on two separate occasions, Dec. 13, 2014, and Jan. 4, 2015.

“We are thrilled to hear about the sighting of the Sierra Nevada red fox, one of the most rare and elusive animals in the Sierra Nevada,” said Don Neubacher, Yosemite National Park Superintendent, in a statement. “National parks like Yosemite provide habitat for all wildlife and it is encouraging to see that the red fox was sighted in the park.”

According to a media release by the National Parks Service, red foxes have previously been seen north of the park in the Sonora Pass area. The Sierra Nevada red fox (Vulpes vulpes necator) is slightly smaller, with darker fur than other red foxes. Fewer than 50 of the foxes are thought to exist today.

The species’ stability was addressed in a 1937 book by Joseph Grinnell, “Fur-bearing Mammals of California.”

“The Sierran red fox is present in such small aggregate numbers, and lives so far removed from human settlements, that it rarely if ever comes into conflict with man’s activities; on the contrary it benefits man by producing a very valuable pelt,” Grinnell wrote.

As fewer and fewer of the pelts were collected -- just two a year by the 1970s, according to NPS -- the species was added to the state-threatened list in 1980. According to the National Parks Service, relatively little is known about the foxes because of the rarity of sightings."
1BacMzK,2015-03-02 00:00:00,'We Call It Life Row': Two of the Youngest US Women on Death Row Describe Life Behind Bars - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/US/call-life-row-youngest-us-women-death-row/story?id=29165934,"When Tiffany Cole and Emilia Carr walk down the hall in Florida’s Lowell Correctional Institution for Women together, they seem more like smiling girlfriends than convicted felons sitting on death row.

Cole is now 33, and Carr is now 30. Carr is the youngest woman in the United States sitting on death row, and Cole is the third youngest. The two women are behind bars for committing two separate crimes, and they had separate lives until they arrived as neighbors on the famous death row corridor at the women’s correctional facility in Ocala, Florida.

“We call it ‘life row,’” Carr said. “It’s life row ... because we’re not dying, we’re living.”

Carr, who is from Ocala, and Cole, from Jacksonville, Florida, share a similar path.

Prior to their incarcerations, neither had ever spent a night in jail, they said. Cole played the flute in high school, and participated in cheerleading and Girl Scouts. Carr was book smart and modeled, she said, and was in the school Marines, which was her high school's Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) program.

Both said they were sexually abused and got into trouble after they met the “wrong people.”

“[I was] looking for love in all the wrong places,” Cole said.

When she was 25 years old, Cole was convicted on murder charges after being connected to the death of her family’s neighbors, Reggie and Carol Sumner, who suffocated to death from dirt in their lungs when they were buried alive. She has acknowledged she helped dig a grave, but said she thought it would be to hide the items that she, her boyfriend, a guy she had known for three weeks and two of his friends had stolen from their victims. A psychiatrist at Cole’s trial said she suffered from mental problems and had a history of drug and alcohol abuse.

“I am not the same person anymore,” Cole said. “I have peace, I have joy. I have a sound mind.”

The jury was shown a damning photo of her celebrating after the crime was committed. She was given the death penalty, which she is in the process of appealing.

Carr was 26 years old and eight months pregnant with her boyfriend’s child when they were both convicted of suffocating his wife with duct tape and a plastic bag. Carr argued she left the scene before the woman was killed.

“Wouldn’t there have been physical evidence? I mean, duct tape is some sticky stuff, yet there’s no finger prints, no DNA, no hair,” Carr said.

But there is video of Carr being interviewing by police, recorded after her boyfriend confessed and implicated her in the crime. On the tape, Carr is heard telling an officer that the boyfriend asked her to “try to snap her neck,” and then Carr says, “I didn’t really try.”

She was convicted of capital murder and given the death penalty, which she is in the process of appealing.

Legal experts say the average appeals process takes 10 to 12 years for death row inmates. Carr has been on death row for four years, while Cole has been on death row for seven years.

Both women are reluctant to give details about their cases under appeal, but both insist the murders they were convicted of were done at the hand of their boyfriends, not them. Both say they are not arguing for their release, just for their lives, to have their executions stayed.

Both refuse to believe they will be executed.

“You can’t have that mentality, because that means you've accepted this,” Carr said.

“You've already died... you’re already dead,” if you accept that, Cole said.

In response to Cole appealing her conviction, the prosecutor who handled her case, Jay Plotkin, said in a statement to ABC News, “I was a prosecutor for more than 20 years. There was not any case that I prosecuted where the crime was more vile or cruel than the torture and murder of the Sumners. This case lingers on in the heart and soul of our community. Ms. Cole is certainly entitled to, and should, exhaust all of her legal rights to appeal. I am personally confident that she received more than adequate representation and a fair trial.”

The prosecutor in Carr’s case, Rock Hooker, declined to comment to ABC News while the appeals process was still pending.

According to the National Academy of Sciences, one in 25 people on death row is innocent."
1BAergN,2015-03-12 00:00:00,Auction for the Real-Life 'Up' House Starts at $216K - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Business/auction-real-life-house-starts-216k/story?id=29586055,"The real-life house that has drawn parallels to the animated film ""Up"" is set to be auctioned Friday in Washington state.

Edith Macefield, the home's previous owner before she died in 2008, had famously refused an offer of $1 million to real estate developers who ultimately built around her home. She stayed in the home for about 50 years until she died of pancreatic cancer at age 86.

""I don't want to move. I don't need the money. Money doesn't mean anything,"" she told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer in October 2007.

The concrete walls of the Ballard Blocks retail and commercial development surrounded Edith's home in Ballard, Washington, much like the home that belonged to balloon salesman Carl Fredricksen in the 2009 animated Disney movie.

Macefield left her home to the superintendent of the development project, Barry Martin, after befriending him over time. She had no family, her obituary noted.

""I think we were a lot alike,"" Barry Martin said in her obituary in the Seattle P-I. ""I am stubborn and so was she. We had some incredible arguments. She was amazingly smart.""

He sold it to a company called Reach Returns, which wanted to offer a space beneath it where people could buy tiles to write their own credos, according to the Seattle P-I. The new owners defaulted on their loans and the home went into foreclosure.

The auction for the home will start at 10 a.m. local time Friday, with bidding starting at $216,270.70, according to Northwest Trustee Services, which is conducting the foreclosure. The auction will take place at the King County Administration Building. The notice of sale indicates the property had debt that totaled $185,956.04, as of Dec. 4, 2014.

The director of the Disney/Pixar film Pete Docter previously said that script writing for the film began in 2004, years before Macefield's famous refusal was publicized. To promote the 2009 animated film, balloons were placed outside Macefield's home.

The Walt Disney Company is the parent of ABC News.

When she died, local tattoo artist Curtis James created a house stencil for local residents to get tattooed, said Ballard resident Michael Stephens.

""I have the house on my forearm and over 25 other people have it on various body parts,"" Stephens told ABC News.

Macefield inspired Stephens and others to create the Macefield Music Festival, which she describes as a local music festival that was ""inspired by her independent spirit.""

Ballard Blocks did not respond to a request for comment by ABC News. Pixar did not respond to a request for comment.

Gerard Wirz, a community organizer for the Eat Ballard group, called the home a ""community treasure.""

""Because Ballard is growing so rapidly, a lot of neighbors have complained about houses that are important to them disappearing overnight,"" he said. ""I think that’s the key message that a lot of people want to get out. They would like to be a part of the decision making process and have some sort of input on this."""

Two armed security security guards told police they were traveling from Miami to Attleboro, Massachusetts along I-95 and pulled over in eastern North Carolina after experiencing mechanical problems, according to the Wilson County Sheriff's Office.

The pair was approached by three armed men driving a white van who ordered the men onto the ground, tied their hands behind their backs and made them walk into the woods, police said.

During that time, the suspects allegedly took gold and silver estimated to be worth more than $4,000,000, police said.

The security guards worked for TransValue Inc., a Florida-based shipping security company that ships goods for companies and banks working within the precious metals industry. The company's CEO Jesus Rodriguez confirmed the robbery to ABC News and said that an internal investigation is underway.

Rodriguez told ABC News there is now a $50,000 reward for information that leads to an arrest or recovery of the stolen property.

The FBI has been contacted and the investigation is ongoing.

The officers, who have not been identified, were ""lucky"" they weren't killed, St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said Thursday. He said police heard ""three or four shots ring out"" before the officers were wounded by a shooter located about 150 feet away.

""We are lucky by God's grace that we didn't lose two police officers,"" he said.

One officer, 41, was struck in the shoulder; the other, 32, in the face, Belmar said. Both have been released from the hospital.

Belmar said the shots were fired from an undetermined location north or northwest of the Ferguson Police Department building.

The search for the suspect or suspects is the ""number one priority"" within the St. Louis County police department, according to Belmar.

Tensions simmered in the city Wednesday after the resignation of the city’s police chief, Tom Jackson, who stepped down in the wake of a Justice Department report that documented widespread racial bias in the city, biases that have gained national attention since the August police shooting of unarmed black teen Michael Brown.

President Obama discussed the shooting and Ferguson unrest in a Thursday appearance on “Jimmy Kimmel Live.”

“I think that what had been happening in Ferguson was oppressive and objectionable and worthy of protest, but there was no excuse from criminal acts, and whoever fired those shots shouldn't detract from the issue. They're criminals. They need to be arrested,” he said.

The phenomenon, called magnetic re-connection, occurs when the Earth and sun's magnetic fields come together, separate and then merge again. The process is believed to be the catalyst for explosive bursts of energy that can impact electronics on Earth, including GPS navigation, communication systems and power grids.

NASA hopes data collected during the billion-dollar two-year mission will lead to a better understanding of space weather and the explosions that send particles flying at the speed of light.

The four spacecraft were stacked atop each other Thursday night and blasted into space on a United Launch Alliance Atlas V 421 rocket from Cape Canaveral in Florida and separated in five minute increments once they were safely in space.

""All four of our spacecraft have deployed and data indicates we have a healthy fleet,"" said Craig Tooley, a NASA project manager.

Each observatory stretches 11-feet wide and 4-feet high and weighs in at around 3,000 pounds, according to NASA. Scientists will test instruments on each observatory over the next several weeks before the spacecraft assume a pyramid formation. Science observations are set to begin in September.

While the mission is expected to yield new insights about the titanic explosions surrounding Earth, scientists expect it will also shed new light on magnetic re-connection in other parts of the solar system."

Lindsey Graham - ABC News",http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/doubt-president-obama-loves-country-sen-lindsey-graham/story?id=29140578,"Potential Republican presidential candidate Sen. Lindsey Graham has ""no doubt"" that President Obama loves his country, refuting comments made by former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani earlier this week.

“Well, I love Rudy, but I don’t want to go there. The nation’s very divided. President Obama has divided us more than he’s brought us together and I don’t want to add to that division,” Graham initially said on ABC's ""This Week"" today, before adding, “I have no doubt that he loves his country. I have no doubt that he’s a patriot. But his primary job as president of the United States is to defend this country and he’s failing miserably.”

The South Carolina senator said that part of that failure stems from labeling the threat posed by ISIS and other terrorist groups as “violent extremism” instead of “radical"" Islamists.

“They’ve adopted a theory of religion that’s 1,000 years old that requires a worldwide caliphate that will purify the Islamic religion, kill or convert every Christian and Jew and vegetarian in their way,” Graham said. “They're not going to stop unless somebody stops them.”

The Obama administration has faced criticism for its reluctance to label ""violent extremism"" as ""Islamic,"" maintaining that ISIS and other extremist groups represent a perversion of the religion and to call them Islamic would legitimize a false claim. Graham, however, took an opposite position.

“I've never been more worried about my country than I am today in terms of radical Islam, and yes, it is radical Islam,” he said.

But Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson defended the administration’s stance in a separate interview on “This Week” today.

“In my view, if we start referring to ISIL [ISIS] as occupying any form of the Islamic theology, we’re pretty much dignifying them as occupying some form of that faith,” Johnson said. “They don’t. Islam is about peace and brotherhood. There are 1.6 billion Muslims in this world and the true Islamic faith has nothing to do with what ISIL represents, and so, to start labeling them as Islam or Islamic State in any respect I think gives them far more dignity than they deserve.”

In the fight against ISIS, Graham said that he wants “the Republican party to talk openly about the hard things, like having boots on the ground in Syria and Iraq, American boots on the ground” and emphasized the need for the use of military power.

“There’s no doubt in my mind militarily that we cannot succeed in our endeavors to degrade and destroy ISIL without having an American component,” Graham said on “This Week.”

Graham also weighed in on the battle in Congress over Department of Homeland Security funding, currently tied up over a House GOP effort to block President Obama’s executive action on immigration. Graham said he believes the executive orders are unconstitutional, but thinks they should be dealt with in the courts so that Congress can move forward on DHS funding.

“I hope my House colleagues will understand that our best bet is to challenge this in court, that if we don’t fund the Department of Homeland Security, we’ll get blamed as a party,” Graham said.

Graham, who created a presidential exploratory committee last month as he mulls a 2016 bid, and traveled to Iowa this week, said he “doesn’t know” if he could win the Republican nomination, but that he’s “going to give it a try.”

“I’m trying to run a campaign, if I decide to run, that will focus on securing this nation,” Graham said. “I think I could create a pathway forward to straighten out the mess we’re in and we’ll see where that goes.”"

Houshi Ryokan, a Japanese inn that opened in the Ishikawa prefecture in 718, has been managed by 46 generations of the Houshi family during its 1,300 years of operation.

Descended from a Buddhist monk, the family has traditionally passed down management of the inn to its eldest sons. But after Zengoro and wife Chizuko Houshi's own son passed away unexpectedly in 2013, the family has since decided to buck convention and turn the reins over to their younger daughter, Hisae.

""I now have many unimaginable responsibilities,"" Hisae told The Atlantic, acknowledging that she had previously planned to move away and work in a different field. ""It is a heavy burden on my mind.""

But the legacy and future of the inn require her to now stay with her family.

""In 1994 Houshi was recognized as the oldest hotel in the world by the publishers of The Guinness Book of Records,"" the Houshi website reads.

The title has since been claimed by another Japanese property.

""We did recognize Houshi Ryokan in Japan until we were made aware of the current record holder,"" said Anthony Yodice, a spokesperson for Guinness World Records. ""The oldest hotel is the Nisiyama Onsen Keiunkan in Yamanashi, Japan, a hot-spring hotel, which has been operating since 705 AD. – this was made official in 2011.""

Still, the family-run Houshi lodge maintains its appeal. Throughout its tenure, the property has been visited by emperors, dignitaries, geishas and many families drawn to its hot spring, spa, signature wagashi confection and bucolic setting."
1BCnhdO,2015-03-13 00:00:00,Average Cost of Weddings Jumps to New All Time High - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/average-cost-weddings-jumps-time-high/story?id=29615916,"Smaller, personalized weddings may be on trend, but bridal budgets have ballooned, according to new data.

The Knot 2014 Real Weddings Study surveyed nearly 16,000 U.S. brides and grooms over the last year and findings revealed that while most couples trimmed their guest list in comparison to years past, the total price tag of the event is as plump as ever.

On average, couples spent $31,213 on their big day in 2014 -- an all-time record high.

""Couples are focusing on putting their money towards the celebratory part of the day for a couple of reasons,"" said Kristen Maxwell Cooper, Deputy Editor of The Knot. ""For one, more and more couples have friends and family coming from out of town and they want to show them a great time and make it worth their travels.""

Costs to achieve this feat fluctuate from region to region. Five of the six most expensive areas to get married were located in the New York/Tri-State area, with Manhattan topping the list at $76,328. Chicago, Illinois, ranked fifth at $50,934.

Meanwhile, the least expensive places to get married, by a significant gap, were Arkansas ($18,031) and Utah ($15,257) in 2014.

To make ends meet, typically the bride’s parents contribute 43% toward the total wedding bill, ""the bride and groom contribute 43%, and the groom’s parents contribute 12% of the total wedding budget (others account for the remaining 2%),"" noted the survey. A scant 12% of couples in 2014 paid for the entire affair themselves.

But despite the effluence of matrimonial monies, the size of weddings are actually getting smaller, revealed the data.

“While wedding budgets continue to rise, guest lists are shrinking,” said Rebecca Dolgin, Editor in Chief of The Knot. ""The average wedding now has 136 guests, down from 149 in 2009.""

So where do the funds go? Survey results indicated that couples are skimping on ceremony costs and funneling as much cash as possible into the reception party.

“Couples are focusing on creating an amazing guest experience and reception details, including finding unique venues to reflect their personality,"" said Dolgin.

Popular alternate venues in 2014 include historic buildings/homes (14%) and farms (6%). While banquet halls (22%), country clubs (11%) and hotels (11%) are still common options for couples, ""about 40% are looking for unusual venues that better reflect their personality,"" noted the survey.

Cooper confirmed that couples were looking to make a statement with their celebration.

""The reception is a place for couples to show their personality and interests--so they may spend more on food and entertainment that reflect those, like an oyster bar if they love seafood or a pricey 80s cover band if they're music enthusiasts,"" said Cooper. ""Cocktail hours are on the rise, up to 76% in 2014 from 69% 2010.""

The national average spend in 2014 on wedding venues was $14,006, with the engagement ring at $5,855, reception band at $3,587, photographer at $2,556, florist at $2,141, wedding planner at $1,973, ceremony site at $1,901 and the big white dress at $1,357.

If those figures seem like they'd break the bank even before you sent out invitations, your prediction is correct--at least, when it comes to almost half of all newlyweds. The Knot's survey revealed that in 2014, roughly 45% of couples went over budget.

""It's usually what we call ""hidden fees"" or fees and extra costs that couples don't think of that put them over budget,"" said Cooper. ""These are things like tips, tax, service fees and overtime fees. Also little things like postage, hair and makeup trials and decorative items like ribbon for favors. We recommend couples to set aside 5% of their overall budget for unexpected costs that come up."""

A replica of a U.S. aircraft carrier was damaged by speedboats during the drills, which were televised in Iran.

Cmdr. Kevin Stephens, the spokesman for the U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet in Bahrain, told the Associated Press that they were monitoring the drills, but downplayed the simulated attack on the carrier, saying the U.S. military was ""not concerned about this exercise.""

The drills come ahead of a deadline for Iran and world powers to finalize a deal regarding Iran’s nuclear program, which has long been a point of contention."

A jury ruled in favor of Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, which had been sued by Ellen Pao, the interim CEO of Reddit and former partner of the firm.

Pao, 45, filed her complaint in May 2012 against the prominent venture capital firm, which is based in Menlo Park, California, near the headquarters of Facebook, one of the many tech firms in which it has invested.

""I have told my story and thousands of people have heard it,"" Pao said, according to The Associated Press. ""If I helped to level the playing field for women and minorities in venture capital, then the battle was worth it.""

The partners of Kleiner Perkins issued a statement after the verdict, saying: “Today’s verdict reaffirms that Ellen Pao’s claims have no legal merit. We are grateful to the jury for its careful examination of the facts. There is no question gender diversity in the workplace is an important issue. KPCB remains committed to supporting women in venture capital and technology both inside our firm and within our industry.”

Here’s what you should know:

Kleiner Perkins hired Pao in June 2005 as chief of staff for one of the managing partners, John Doerr. After working at a handful of technology firms and a law firm, her title with Kleiner was junior partner. Pao studied electrical engineering at Princeton and went to Harvard Law School and Harvard Business School.

""She was told if she was successful in this role, she would move to a full-time investing role after three years,"" according to her lawsuit.

In her suit, Pao said another partner who is no longer with the firm made ""inappropriate sexual approaches"" during a business trip to Germany in February 2006, and she ""rebuffed his advances.”

From March to October 2006, that former partner, Ajit Nazre, allegedly pressured Pao to ""have a sexual relationship with him"" and falsely told her that his wife had left him, the suit said.

Pao ""eventually succumbed to Mr. Nazre's insistence on sexual relations on two or three occasions,"" but in October 2006 she told him she would ""no longer have a personal relationship with him,"" the suit says.

Kleiner Perkins has denied all of Pao's claims in court. Nazre could not be reached for comment.

Over the course of five years, Nazre ""engaged in retaliation against"" her, including excluding her from ""numerous"" business meetings and removing her from business email discussions where she had initially been included,"" the court filing stated.

Pao alleged that she repeatedly complained to superiors about this treatment but was told ""that she should just accept it,"" the suit said. She also alleged ""inappropriate"" behavior by other male employees. The firm has said that Pao didn't complain about alleged harassment until late 2011.

Six months after filing suit, Pao was fired in late 2012, which Pao said was in response to her lawsuit, while the firm claims she was fired for her performance.

Christina Lee, a spokeswoman for the firm, said in a statement to ABC News, ""This suit is completely without merit and has no basis in the law. KPCB has a well-established record of championing women in our firm, our portfolio companies and the overall industry. We look forward to clearing our name in court.""

In one alleged example, on Valentine's Day in 2007, a senior partner came into Pao's office, the suit states. He gave her a book called ""Book of Longing,"" by Leonard Cohen, which contained sexual drawings and poems with ""strong sexual content,"" and invited her to dinner, explaining that his wife would be out of town, the suit states. The firm has stated that Pao never previously complained about the book and that it had been purchased by the partner's wife and was given because of a shared interest in Buddhism.

The suit said Pao ""believed that the retaliation and gender discrimination were affecting her compensation at KPCB, because women generally were not treated equivalently or promoted to Senior Partner based on their gender.""

Pao alleged she was criticized during performance reviews for qualities that male employees were praised for, such as being ""aggressive,"" according to the lawsuit. On the stand, one of the supervising partners, Ted Schlein, said Pao was ""entitled,"" ""territorial"" and that big-picture thinking ""wasn't part of Ellen's genetic makeup,"" according to Re/Code.

Kleiner Perkins says that 20 percent of its investing partners are women, compared to the industry average of 6 percent, which comes from the “Diana Report: Women Entrepreneurs 2014,” from Babson College.

Pao was seeking $16 million in past and future lost earnings. The judge had previously ruled that she could seek punitive damages."
1BdDhEn,2015-02-26 00:00:00,"'Super Bug' Linked to Antibiotic Use Kills Nearly 15,000 Annually - ABC News",http://abcnews.go.com/Health/super-bug-linked-antibiotic-kills-30000-yearly/story?id=29226704,"A stubborn, hard-to-treat “super bug” causes more than 450,000 infections a year and is directly responsible for nearly 15,000 deaths in the United States, a report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention revealed today.

Clostridium difficile, or C. Diff, is a bacterial infection that leads to inflammation of the colon, the agency explained. The bacterium is found in feces, the agency said, and is spread by hand contact or contaminated surfaces.

More than 80 percent of C. Diff deaths were people 65 or older, with residents of nursing homes especially vulnerable to infection, the report said.

“C. difficile infections cause immense suffering and death for thousands of Americans each year,” CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden said.

Hospital stays and especially long-term antibiotic use seem to up the risk of C. Diff infection.

“Antibiotics kill off beneficial bacteria in the gut which fight infection, leaving space for C. Diff to come in and release its toxins,” explained Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert with Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville, Tennessee.

Studies show that more than half of patients receive antibiotics at some point in their stay, and up to 50 percent of antibiotic use is unnecessary. Over-prescribing antibiotics, combined with poor infection control, may allow the spread of C. diff and other bacteria within a facility and to other facilities when a sick patient is transferred, the CDC report speculated.

The CDC report said preventing and controlling C. Diff should be a national priority. The infection costs up to $4.8 billion each year in excess health care costs, the agency reported.

“You can fight it with hand hygiene, early diagnosis, isolating sick patients and curtailing excessive antibiotic use,” Schaffner said.

Meticulously cleaning surgical instruments would also help, Schaffner noted. Seven people were diagnosed last week with another drug-resistant ""super bug"" known as CRE at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center after undergoing endoscopy procedures with instruments that may have been contaminated."

The shooting tonight, in which two police officers were also wounded, occurred just hours after a gunman killed one person and wounded three cops at a free-speech event at a café in the Danish city, police said.

Police were looking for at least one gunman in that attack at the Krudttoenden cafe, which Danish officials described as terrorism and an assassination attempt.

""We feel certain now that it is a politically motivated attack, and thereby it is a terrorist attack,"" Danish Prime Minister Helle Thornin-Schmidt said of the cafe shooting.

Police tweeted early Sunday local time that officers shot a man at the city's Norrebro train station, but did not say whether it was connected to the shootings at the synagogue and the cafe. They also said the condition of the person shot was unknown.

At a news conference late Saturday night, police asked residents to respect road blocks set up around the crime scenes, but said there is no curfew or lockdown in the city.

Officials also said that residents should continue about their regular routine as there is a ""massive presence of police in Copenhagen.""

Police initially said they were looking for two shooters in the attack at the cafe, but after interviews with witnesses they said they believed there was only one.

They released a security photo of the suspect, showing a man in a dark coat, with what appeared to be a reddish hat and scarf covering much of his face.

The shooting happened about 4 p.m. at an event titled ""Art, Blasphemy and Freedom of Expression,"" organized by Swedish artist Lars Vilks, who has faced several threats after caricaturing the Prophet Muhammad.

""I'm not sure how many shots but I'd say about 20 or 30 shots,"" sais Dennis Myhoff-Brink, who witnessed the attack . ""And, people panicked of course and ran to the doors. Other people were hiding behind tables they had turned over.""

Vilks, 68, who was not injured in the shooting, said he believed he was the intended target.

""What other motive could there be? It's possible it was inspired by Charlie Hebdo,"" he told The Associated Press.

The shooting happened a month after gunmen opened fire on the Charlie Hebdo satirical magazine in Paris, killing 12 people.

The windows of the cafe were riddled with dozens of bullet holes, reported Danish news channel TV2.

The conditions of the three officers injured were not released by police, according to the AP. The 40-year-old victim was not identified.

While no one has claimed responsibility for the shooting, one of the organizers, Helle Merete Brix, told the AP she felt Vilks was targeted.

""I saw a masked man running past,"" Brix said. ""I clearly consider this as an attack on Lars Vilks."""
1BdhLj4,2015-02-25 00:00:00,Exclusive: Texas Gov. Greg Abbott Says Constitution Trumps ‘Compassion’ for Undocumented Immigrants - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/exclusive-texas-gov-greg-abbott-rule-law-trumps/story?id=29218207,"Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told ABC News the Constitution trumps “compassion” for undocumented immigrants.

In an exclusive interview with ABC News and Fusion inside the ornate governor’s mansion in Austin, Texas, Abbott, whose federal lawsuit stopped President Obama’s executive action protecting millions from deportation, admitted he has no solution for what to do with the 11 million undocumented people living and working in the United States today. He said that’s not his responsibility, its President Obama’s.

“As the governor of Texas, I don’t have the luxury of making that decision. That is the job of the United States Congress and the president,” Abbott said. “And [that is] the reason why we have this lawsuit.”

Undocumented immigrants, many of whom are already paying taxes and have no criminal history, were granted legal status by President Obama’s executive action taken last November.

A federal judge earlier this month blocked Obama’s plans to allow more undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children and undocumented parents of U.S. citizens to remain in the U.S. without fear of deportation. The judge was ruling on a lawsuit filed by Abbott when he was the Texas attorney general.

That is being appealed by the Obama administration. The administration filed an emergency stay this week to allow applicants to his immigration programs to register while the lawsuit moves through the court system.

Abbott claims Obama's executive action overstepped his authority.

“What the president did here was to trample the rule of law,” Abbott told ABC News. “The president is being a dictator by issuing laws in contradiction of his power under the United States Constitution.”

A study this week by a pro-immigration reform group put the cost of deporting 11 million undocumented currently living in the United States at $50 billion.

Abbott told ABC News more should be spent on border security, even though the Department of Homeland Security says fewer immigrants are crossing America’s southern frontier than they have since the 1970s.

Undocumented families interviewed by ABC News said they want the governor to know the issue is not about a “political battle” with the president, it’s about their lives.

""I've got compassion for everyone,"" Abbott told ABC News in response. ""But in the Constitution, it requires the president to follow the law. There's no article or Bill of Rights in the Constitution that says compassion allows the president to circumvent the rules of the Constitution. And that's exactly what the president has done.""

That's how Donna Scharton remembers her beloved parents, Floyd and Violet Hartwig, before they died on Feb. 11.

The couple, who had been married for 67 years, died in their home in a very ""Notebook""-like situation.

As the two laid close to one another, Scharton and other immediate family members pushed their beds close together as they all knew the end was near.

""My mom had dementia for the last several years and around the holidays we noticed she was going down,"" Scharton of Fresno, California said. ""Then, I got a call from the doctor saying 'your dad has kidney failure and he has two weeks to live.' So, we decided to put them in hospice together.""

Prior to their declining health, the Hartwigs owned a ranch in Easton, California. The two met while in grammar school and had developed a relationship upon Mr. Hartwig returning home from the Navy.

They married on Aug. 16, 1947 and had two other children, Carol and Kenneth, in addition to Scharton.

""My dad was in the Navy for six years,"" she told ABC News. ""He worked for the J.B. Hill Company delivering eggs and then for a feed company. Mom stayed home, helped take care of the ranch, and cooked all the meals. She made breakfast for dad at 4:30 in the morning every day.""

Scharton said that although his health was deteriorating, her father's main priority was the love of his life.

""He would tell the doctor, 'I'm okay I just want her fixed',” she added. ""That was his concern; not how bad his pain was, but that he wanted my mom fixed.""

""We could tell my dad was in a lot more pain,"" Scharton cried. ""We said 'it's getting close,' so we pushed the hospital beds together as far as we could. We put their hands together, and my dad died holding my mom's hand. Mom was not coherent, but we told her that dad had passed away and that he was waiting for her. She died five hours later.""

Scharton's daughter, Cynthia Letson, remembers her grandparents as simple people who just loved having their family beside them.

""They never, ever asked for anything,"" she said. ""All they ever wanted was their family and it was amazing that they got that in the end.""

In honor of their legacy, Scharton is holding onto warm memories of her mother and father.

""Mom did a lot of sewing – made our clothes and stuff,"" Scharton said. ""She joined the PTA at school and she loved doing her crossword puzzles. They were very devoted and when dad came home we'd always have supper together.

""I remember them kissing each other goodbye every morning. I remember mom called him Blondie because he had such pretty blonde hair and blue eyes.""

""What I want people to get out of this story is my dad's commitment to serving his country and loving his family. ""What we felt was keeping them alive was the will to live, and that they didn’t want to let go of each other."""

The organization that oversees Nathaniel Narbonne High School's team in the Harbor City area of Los Angeles has strict rules regarding team colors. So now, Narbonne is appealing a decision that forced the team to forfeit a 57-52 win on Saturday against View Park Preparatory Accelerated Charter High School.

""Uniform colors may only be a combination of the official school colors. Pink is not a school color at Narbonne. Penalties will include probation and forfeiture of contents,"" the California Interscholastic Federation's Los Angeles City Section said in a statement, according to ABC station KABC in Los Angeles.

Team members were taken aback by the decision that disqualified the team from title contention.

""I kind of thought it was maybe just a joke at one point in time until all the teammates started to say, 'No, this is serious.' It was very, very shocking to us,"" Narbonne senior guard Laticia Smith told KABC. ""The punishment didn't fit the crime. You know, we feel like we really didn't know. We had no idea and if we had some type of warning, we would have never come on the court with those uniforms.""

The approved colors of the top-seeded school are green, gold and black. Earlier in the school year, the North Hollywood High girls' volleyball team forfeited a match because it wore uniforms that were entirely black.

Pro teams have changed their colors based on a particular cause or group. For instance, NFL teams have approved use of pink gloves, cleats and wristbands for breast cancer awareness and, in the NBA, the Houston Rockets and Golden State Warriors were allowed to wear red uniforms with Chinese lettering to celebrate Lunar New Year.

Narbonne's athletic director and principal were told of the violation during halftime and the decision to disqualify the team was made later, according to the Los Angeles Times.

The school is appealing the decision and a panel is hearing its case today, the Times reported.

The team hopes to play in the championship game on Saturday, KABC reported.

The California Interscholastic Federation's Los Angeles City Section did not respond to a request for comment from ABC News. The statewide California Interscholastic Federation said the issue is under the jurisdiction of CIF LA City Section's rule and not a CIF State rule.

Narbonne High School did not respond to a request for comment from ABC News.

The City Section gave some teams waivers to wear pink in their uniforms during breast cancer awareness month in October.

""If they are going to do something against our bylaws, they need to call us to request it,"" City Section commissioner John Aguirre told the Times."

Only 18-months-old, Hulk weighs a hefty 175 pounds.

Despite his intimidating size, his owners Marlon Grannan and his wife Lisa Grannan say Hulk is a sweet family dog and a best friend to their 3-year-old son Jordan.

Online videos and photos of Hulk with their son in their New Hampshire home shatter misconceptions about Pit Bulls as ruthless monsters.

Grannan's toddler can be seen riding Hulk, singing with him and napping with him.

""He's a wonderful, excellently trained dog,"" Grannan said. ""He plays with my kid, he's great with the family and he's so, so sweet.""

""Because Pit Bulls are only in the media when bad things happen, this myth of them as monsters gets perpetuated,"" Grannan added, ""but it's not true. They might not be for everyone, but under a good leader and with proper training, they make amazing family and work or protection dogs.""

Grannan and his wife are the owners of Dark Dynasty K9s, family-owned kennel that breeds and trains American Pit Bull Terriers as protection dogs for clients worldwide. Dark Dynasty K9s is also a member of the American Dog Breeders Association and the United Kennel Club.

""I want to emphasize that we breed and train dogs who come in stable,"" Grannan said. ""Our goal is to make these dogs fearless for the intimidation factor that protection dogs need to have, not for them to be uncontrolled and maul or bite anyone. That is improper training.""

He owns 12 Pit Bulls in training and one Chihuahua. All of them live and work with him at their 150-acre home and kennel, Grannan said.

And yet, Hulk, the biggest of them all, has garnered the most attention. A video of him being weighed last month had over 7 million views as of Tuesday morning.

""My hope is that we can stop ignorance and change people's minds about Pit Bulls in a positive way with all this attention,"" Grannan said."

The woman first felt sick on March 2, after drinking a smoothie, according to the Boulder County Sheriff's Office. While she noticed the smell of bleach from her glass, the woman assumed her daughter hadn't rinsed it properly, according to the sheriff's office.

Then a few days later, the mother again recognized the smell of bleach coming from something she was going to drink and she confronted the pre-teen, the sheriff's office said. The girl allegedly told her she wanted to kill her because she took away her iPhone, according to the sheriff's office.

The girl had allegedly poured bleach into her mother's water carafe, the sheriff's office said.

On March 6, the mother was at the Boulder Community Hospital when she contacted authorities to investigate.

The woman is no longer in the hospital and is in fine condition, the sheriff's office said today.

On Friday, the 12-year-old was detained at the Boulder County Juvenile Center on two counts of attempted first-degree murder, according to the sheriff's office.

""She had pre-planned this a couple different times,"" Sgt. Bill Crist of the sheriff's office said.

The investigation is ongoing, and the District Attorney's office will decide what charges to pursue, according to the sheriff's office."
1BFR6xg,2015-02-26 00:00:00,A Look Inside the Mistakes in JonBenet Ramsey Investigation Noted by Former Police Chief - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/US/inside-mistakes-jonbenet-ramsey-investigation-noted-police-chief/story?id=29247378,"The former Boulder police chief said mistakes were made in the initial handling of the JonBenet Ramsey murder case that transfixed a nation two decades ago.

Mark Beckner gave a lengthy interview on Reddit this week revisiting the case and plainly detailing mistakes he felt the police made in the early days of the case.

The unusual murder case drew nationwide attention as no one was ever arrested or charged in the case. JonBenet Ramsey, 6, was found murdered in the basement of her family home on Christmas Day. The 6-year-old beauty queen was reported missing hours earlier by her parents after a ransom note was found in their home.

Nearly 20 years after the murder, Beckner spoke about the case and what he wishes he could change about the early investigation and what he thinks might have happened the night the girl was killed.

Beckner said first off the police officers should have shut down the crime scene immediately and taken statements from JonBenet's parents. Since the crime happened on Christmas Day, Beckner said there were fewer people available to get to the scene.

Beckner also said one key mistake was not getting full statements from parents John and Patricia Ramsey the day of the crime.

The former police chief said that the girl's parents seemed to show unusual behavior but clarified that could have been due to a number of reasons.

A spokeswoman for the Boulder Police said today that the mistakes cited by Beckner have been addressed in subsequent years.

""Those problems were acknowledged early in the investigation and over the years by Mark Beckner when he was chief. ... That information is not new,"" Public Information Officer Kim Kobel told ABC News, clarifying that the Ramsey case remains open but not active. ""It's still an open investigation. ... We still get tips and leads.""

There appeared to be a major break in the case when a teacher John Mark Karr confessed to killing JonBenet. A subsequent investigation found that Karr could not have committed the crime.

Beckner said he was wary of Karr's confession from the beginning.

Beckner noted in the Reddit talk that there were multiple parts of the crime that appeared odd to investigators, including a lengthy two-and-a-half page ransom note.

Beckner also said that law enforcement believed the note was written after the murder and there was never an intent to kidnap the girl. Instead, he said he believes that the case was always a murder staged to look like a botched kidnapping.

In an interview with the Daily Camera newspaper, Beckner later said he didn't realize his comments would be open to anyone and he regretted doing the question and answer session this week.

""I talked to the organizer and my impression was that this was a members-only type group that talked about unsolved mysteries all around the world,"" Beckner told the Daily Camera.

He later deleted his comments from Reddit. Beckner did not respond to a request for comment from ABC News."
1Bgdc7N,2015-02-25 00:00:00,"ISIS: 3 New York Men Arrested in Alleged Plot to Join Terror Group, Feds Say - ABC News",http://abcnews.go.com/US/WorldNews/isis-arrested-plot-join-terror-group/story?id=29222291,"Three New York City men were arrested today on charges they allegedly conspired to join  ISIS in Syria, while also trying to carry out attacks on the terror group's behalf in the United States, the authorities said.

The men had planned to travel to the Middle East and had also pledged to launch attacks in this country, including one on President Obama or planting a bomb in Coney Island, Brooklyn, federal officials said.

Federal officials said Akhror Saidakhmetov, 19, was arrested today at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, where he was attempting to board a flight to Istanbul.

Abdurasul Hasanovich Juraboev, 24, had a plane ticket to travel to Turkey sometime next month. He was arrested in Brooklyn, according to the feds.

Abror Habibov, 30, a third man, is accused of helping fund Saidakhmetov's efforts, authorities said. He was arrested in Florida.

The arrests came as FBI Director James Comey spoke today about how ISIS, also known as ISIL, is recruiting members through its use of social media and propaganda.

""ISIL in particular, is putting out a siren song through their slick propaganda through social media that goes like this: 'Troubled soul, come to the caliphate, you will live a life of glory, these are the apocalyptic end times, you will find a life of meaning here fighting for our so-called caliphate and if you can't come, kill somebody where you are."" That is a message that goes out to troubled souls everywhere,"" he said.

In August 2014, Juraboev allegedly posted this message on an Uzbek-language site of ISIS: “I am in USA now. ... But is it possible to commit ourselves as dedicated martyrs anyway while here? What I’m saying is, to shoot Obama and then get shot ourselves, will it do? That will strike fear in the hearts of infidels,"" according to the criminal complaint.

A week later, the FBI met with Juraboev twice. He allegedly told them that he believes in ISIS’ terrorist agenda and that he would like to go to Syria to fight with ISIS “if Allah wills,” authorities said.

He also told them he would harm Obama if he could, based on president’s role in killing Muslims, his support for Israel and recent bombings of ISIS. Juraboev allegedly said he didn’t have an imminent plan to harm Obama, but that if anyone within ISIS told him to, he would, authorities said.

Undercover FBI agents had twice met with Juraboev, where he again professed his loyalty to ISIS and repeated his claims that he would kill the president should the terror group ask him to, authorities said.

""ISIL calls on its followers to come fight for the terrorist organization in Syria, and in messages to followers outside Syria, ISIL has called on them to attack police, intelligence officers or the military in their home countries including the United States,” said NYPD Police Commissioner Bill Bratton. ""By pledging allegiance to ISIL, these defendants conspired to fight for a designated foreign terrorist organization either in Syria, or even New York.""

In one November 2014 discussion, Saidakhmetov allegedly suggested he join the U.S. military so he could pass military information to ISIS -– and if his plan ever fell apart, he could open fire on American soldiers, according to the charging documents.

And then just last month, Saidakhmetov said he could buy a machine gun and “shoot all police” before “go[ing] to the FBI headquarters” to “kill the FBI people,” authorities said.

“It was made quite plain based on those statements that if they were not able to go [to Syria or Iraq], that they would seek to acquire weapons here .. and seek to attack,” Bratton said. “Those aspirations were made quite clear.""

Nevertheless, by that time, Saidakhmetov and Juraboev had purchased tickets to fly to Turkey, a known destination point for those looking to sneak into Syria, the charging documents say.

""The defendants looked to join the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, by flying to Turkey in a vain attempt to evade detection. And several of the defendants planned to commit acts of terror here -- in America -- if they could not travel, to include killing FBI agents,” added FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge Diego Rodriguez. ""The defendants violated the true tenants of their faith in pursuit of their radical, violent agenda. We rely on help from the community, the public and religious leaders to be mindful of those who could be radicalized. We cannot do this alone.""

Saidakhmetov is a Brooklyn, N.Y., resident and citizen of Kazakhstan. Juraboev and Habibov also live Brooklyn and are citizens of Uzbekistan.

The men have been charged with attempt and conspiracy to provide material support to a terrorist organization.

Habibov was arraigned this afternoon in Jacksonville, Florida. His alleged accomplices appeared in federal court in Brooklyn. All three were detained.

Adam Perlmutter, a defense attorney for Saidakhmetov, said, “It is my hope that in America that the presumption of innocence still holds and added that the ""U.S. government needs to find another way to approach Muslim men who could be radicalized.""

If convicted, the men each face a maximum sentence of 15 years behind bars.

At least eight people have died, according to the Vanuatu National Disaster Management Office, the director of UNICEF Australia, Tim O'Connor, told ABC News.

“We’re extremely concerned for [the] safety and well being of tens of thousands of people across Vanuatu,” the Australian Red Cross said in a statement. “Humanitarian needs will be enormous. Many people have lost their homes. Shelter, food and water [are] urgent priorities.”

The storm uprooted trees, blew roofs from homes and downed power lines across Port Vila. Chloe Morrison, a World Vision emergency communications officer who is in Port Vila, said there is no power or running water in the capital and that communication remains unreliable.

""It's still really quite dangerous outside. Most people are still hunkering down,"" she said. ""The damage is quite extensive in Port Vila but there are so many more vulnerable islands. I can't even imagine what it's like in those vulnerable communities.""

U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said the impact of the disaster wasn't yet clear, but he feared the damage and destruction could be widespread.

""We hope the loss of life will be minimal,"" he said during a World Conference on Disaster Risk and Reduction in Japan.

Ban said he had met the president of Vanuatu, Baldwin Lonsdale, who is attending the conference, and expressed the U.N.'s condolences and solidarity. The U.N. said it was preparing to deploy emergency rapid response units.

Located about a quarter of the way from Australia to Hawaii, Vanuatu has a population of 267,000 spread over 65 islands. About 47,000 people live in the capital.

1BH9eS7,2015-03-28 00:00:00,Possibility of Criminal Charges in New York City Building Collapse Growing - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/US/possibility-criminal-charges-york-city-building-collapse-growing/story?id=29982760,"As searchers and cadaver dogs sift through the rubble looking for victims and evidence, New York City officials tell ABC News that the possibility is growing that criminal charges could be filed as a result of the blast and building collapse in the East Village.

Investigators with the Manhattan District Attorney's Office are now fully engaged, according to a law-enforcement source, as opposed to simply ""monitoring"" the investigation -- which would be the standard procedure.

""They are on-site and they've given instructions"" about what type of information may or may not be released by other city agencies, the source said.

The Manhattan District Attorney's Office is not commenting at this point.

Two city officials tell ABC News investigators are now pursuing reports from tenants that they were told by building management to report gas problems to the landlord and not the energy company, Con Edison, or to 911.

Some tenants have told investigators that they were given those instructions as late as Thursday morning -- just before Con Ed inspectors were scheduled to examine plumbing in the basement.

Investigators have not yet confirmed these reports. But if they are found to be accurate, it could prove to be critical. Investigators and prosecutors are trying to determine whether the piping work done in the basement was legal and done appropriately, or if the building's owners knew they were violating the city code and, thus, might be jeopardizing the safety of people in and around the building.

Specific instructions to tenants that they should not call the city or the utility could be a key indicator that someone knew the gas piping might not be up to code, the officials said.

It is these reports, the officials said, that prompted Mayor Bill de Blasio to be so emphatic in the last couple of days as he reminded people during his briefings that gas odors must be reported immediately to the city or the utility. He stressed that no one should rely on simply calling their landlord.

The owner of the ground-floor restaurant where the explosion occurred called the landlord to report the gas leak Thursday, and it is that leak that is believed to be the cause of the blast.

Though the mayor has cautioned that the cleanup and probe will take time, investigators want to get into the basement as soon as they can to examine the gas pipes. They believe those pipes will provide the most crucial evidence.

Two people were still missing tonight, and 22 people were injured in the explosion and collapse."

Peterson, the Minnesota Vikings running back who was benched after being charged with child abuse for allegedly disciplining his son with a switch, made his first public statement on the issue today.

""I am not a perfect son. I am not a perfect husband. I am not a perfect parent, but I am, without a doubt, not a child abuser,"" he said in a statement released through his agent and that he posted on social media today.

Read Adrian Peterson's Statement on Disciplining His Child

""I never imagined being in a position where the world is judging my parenting skills or calling me a child abuser because of the discipline I administered to my son,"" Peterson said.

The incident occurred at his home in Texas this May but was not known publicly until Friday when he was indicted. He allegedly hit his 4-year-old son with a thin branch and the incident was reported by a doctor who was concerned about how much the boy was bleeding.

""I have to live with the fact that when I disciplined my son the way I was disciplined as a child, I caused an injury that I never intended or thought would happen,"" Peterson said in the statement. ""I know that many people disagree with the way I disciplined my child. I also understand after meeting with a psychologist that there are other alternative ways of disciplining a child that may be more appropriate.""

Peterson has never spoken publicly about the ways in which he was disciplined as a child, but alluded to having received similar punishments as a child. He said in his statement today, ""I have always believed that the way my parents disciplined me has a great deal to do with the success I have enjoyed as a man.""

The Vikings benched the star running back for last week’s game but announced today that he will be reinstated this week. His next hearing is on Wednesday and he has not yet entered a plea.

Vikings General Manager Rick Spielman said the team has met with Peterson and his lawyers several times before allowing him to return to the team this week.

""This is a difficult path to navigate... on how a parent disciplines their child,"" Spielman said. He added, ""We believe he deserves to play while the legal process plays out.”

Spielman declined to say whether Peterson's actions were child abuse. ""We must defer ot the legal system to determine if he went too far, but we cannot make that judgment,"" he said."
1BHtYrC,2015-03-23 00:00:00,Some Service Members on Purported ISIS 'Hit List' Unfazed by Threat - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/service-members-purported-isis-hit-list-unfazed-threat/story?id=29827367,"Several of the military service members whose personal information appears on a purported ISIS ""hit list"" said today they are unfazed by the online threat, as military officials continued the process of notifying individuals named on the list.

The personal information of 100 service members was posted on a website by a previously unknown group calling itself the ""Islamic State Hacking Division"" that urged ""lone wolf"" sympathizers to kill those named on the list.

ABC News is not identifying the three service members who provided reactions to their personal information appearing on the list.

""This is just a way they are trying to intimidate us -- and it's not going to work,"" said one service member.

Another service member said it is not surprising that ISIS wants to hurt members of the U.S. military, though he was surprised that this group would be ""brazen"" enough to publish it.

A third service member called the publishing of the list ""regrettable"" but said he had no concerns for himself or his family.

They would not disclose what precautions they had taken in the wake of the online threat, though they said they were already being cautious.

""I wouldn't say I'm scared,"" said one of the service members. ""It's just part of this 'new war' against an enemy with a different, more developed capability than what we've faced in the past. We have to make the adjustments in order to continue to win the battles.""

A defense official told ABC News it does not appear that the information on the list was gained through a data breach. Instead, the official said it all appears to have come from publicly available information on social media and Internet sites.

Some of the service members acknowledged that information on the Internet can make such a threat possible.

""We really weren't surprised because all the people I saw on that list are on a webpage some place anyways, all that information was already public,"" said one service member.

""In a world with computers, it's easy to find information on anyone,"" said another. ""We have a footprint -- the best we can do is to make that foot print not so deep in the sand.""

The service members said they had been made aware of the threat, though some would not disclose under what specific circumstances.

In the wake of the threat, U.S. Central Command posted a message on its Facebook page reminding its personnel to maintain ""a heightened sense of vigilance whether dealing with work or home computer usage, specifically as it relates to Social Media.""

""Adversaries and malicious 'cyber' actors continue to use any method possible in an attempt to gain access and exploit any information they can,"" the posting said."

Milford, 28, a sales manager from Melrose, Massachusetts, outside Boston, and fiancee Allison Gilgun claimed the prize on Tuesday together, choosing the one-time cash payment of nearly $9.8 million, less taxes.

It is the largest instant ""scratch and win"" prize awarded in their state, following the ""World Class Millions"" prize awarded for the same game in July.

Milford purchased only one lucky ticket for $30 on Sunday at Boyles Family Market in Medford. Durna Rejak, who works at the store, told ABC News Milford is a regular and a ""really nice guy.""

""Someone from the lottery came to the store with a banner,"" Rejak said. ""I didn't know anything about it so I called the owner and he didn't know yet."" The store gets $50,000 for selling the ticket. It's the highest retailer lottery bonus paid in Massachusetts.

Milford and his fiancee, a school teacher, will get married in December in the Dominican Republic, and will use part of the money for their nuptials. They have planned their wedding for several months, according to the state lottery. Milford said he would be using some of his winnings to pay off existing bills, help family members and invest for the future.

Two $15 million prizes remain in the state's “World Class Millions” game."

Erica Kinsman shared her story in “The Hunting Ground,” which filmmakers say seeks to expose the epidemic of violence and institutional cover-ups sweeping college campuses across America.

According to Kinsman, the alleged incident occurred at Winston’s off-campus apartment on Dec. 7, 2012 following a night of drinking. At the time, she was a student at Florida State University, and Winston was the university’s superstar quarterback.

“I just want to know, ‘Why me?’” she said in the film, which is appearing in theaters starting today. “It doesn’t really make sense.”

Kinsman told filmmakers Amy Ziering and Kirby Dick that when she identified her alleged rapist, she was told by the lead detective, “This is a huge football town. You really should think long and hard about whether you want to press charges or not.”

While the Tallahassee Police’s handling of the case has been criticized, no charges were filed in the case, with Florida State Attorney Willie Meggs citing insufficient evidence. Winston -- who has maintained that the encounter was consensual -- was also cleared in a university code of conduct hearing.

Winston is slated to be one of the top picks in this year’s NFL Draft.

Ziering contends that Florida State University’s desire to protect its reputation, and the athlete involved, contributed to how the case was handled.

“Here's a family that really believed in law enforcement, really believed in their school, in their institution, could not imagine it would not do the right thing by them,” Ziering said.

Kinsman eventually left the university. The filmmakers noted Kinsman faced backlash after coming forward.

“The reprisals she experienced ... she received all kinds of very aggressive comments on social media,” Dick said.

A university official told ABC News FSU was not aware Kinsman ever said she felt driven out of the university, adding that university officials ""went to extraordinary lengths to support her.""

""FSU uses a nationally recognized victim-centered approach in handling sexual assault complaints, and our victim advocate professionals were by Ms. Kinsman's side throughout this case,"" said Browning Brooks, assistant vice president for university communications. ""She was provided academic accommodations regarding class schedules and exams, access to counseling and was informed about all of her options in deciding whether to initiate criminal or student conduct charges under Title IX.""

The filmmakers are thankful that the subjects in “The Hunting Ground” agreed to participate in the movie, and believe that the victims’ voices can help people to consider the significance of college sexual assaults.

“I hope it radically changes the way our culture and our country views this issue and views these crimes,” Ziering said.

“The Hunting Ground,” which was shown at Sundance Film Festival, features a Lady Gaga song with Diane Warren, “Til It Happens to You.”"

Sony today unveiled the latest prototype of its Project Morpheus gaming headset and revealed that consumers could strap on the device as early as the first half of next year.

While the virtual reality headset looks similar to the first prototype shown off last year, it's packed with new technological improvements that will give wearers a better experience.

Sony traded out its 5-inch LCD for a 5.7-inch OLED display, which allows the wearer's field of vision to expand, the company said on its PlayStation blog.

The new display is twice as fast as the first prototype, packing smoother visuals that allow wearers to feel as though they are in a virtual world and responding to wearers’ movements in half the time.

The lag time between when wearers move their head and when their movement is reflected on the screen has been shaved down to 18 milliseconds, according to Sony.

Other changes include three more LEDs on the front and sides of the headset, enabling better 360-degree tracking.

As with many virtual reality headsets, taking it off can be a production. The latest prototype is lighter and comes with a quick-release button for when gamers decide they've had enough of the virtual world, Sony said."

“I could not look into his eyes because he wouldn't look at me,” she told ABC News today after testifying Wednesday. “But I tried and I looked him in the face several times and I wanted him to know I was not scared of him.”

She said when she looks at Tsarnaev now, she sees a “coward.” Tsarnaev couldn’t look at her, Gregory said, because she believes he’s unable to “face what he’s really done.”

Gregory lost her left leg in the April 2013 attack that killed three people –- including an eight-year-old boy –- and injured 260 others. Gregory was one of 16 to lose limbs.

Her son, Noah, was sitting at her feet when the bomb went off, but after the explosions, when she tried to help him, she realized she couldn’t get to him.

“I was like, ‘This is it. I’m gone. I can’t even help Noah as a mother. I am completely helpless at this point,'” she said, adding she thought she was going to die that day.

Noah survived with minor injuries.

Gregory said before arriving at court she experienced a flood of emotions, and she reflected back on how fearful she used to be.

“I had been for a very long time. And I didn’t realize I was so fearful, but I truly was and until yesterday, I had this sense of insecurity because of how much I had lost at the finish line that day and I took so much of that back,” she said.

Tsarnaev’s defense said in opening statements they’re not going to contest the fact that their client, along with his late older brother Tamerlan, was responsible for detonating the two bombs that day.

Legal experts told ABC News the defense is likely focusing only on trying to avoid the death penalty for Tsarnaev in the penalty phase of the case."

It was all part of the White House's participation in a ""Worldwide InstaMeet,"" a social media event hosted by Instagram a few times each year where people meet in specific places to ""connect, take photos together and inspire one another,"" the photo-sharing company says.

This was not the only time the administration had done an Instagram event: It once gave special access to its gardens and kitchen for a smaller domestic InstaMeet in 2013. Similarly it was used by the National Park Service when the Washington Monument was reopened and by the National Zoo to introduce its baby panda, Bao Bao. But this year was a first for participation in a world-scale meet.

Here are some of our favorites from the shoot, but more can be found by following the ""#WHInstaMeet"" hashtag on Twitter or Instagram.

No photo tour of the White House would be complete without a massive group selfie with Pete Souza, the official White House photographer for President Obama. He is kneeling in the red, striped shirt.

The rooms of the White House complex hold a motley mix of styling from the ornate to the simple and efficient. We like the contrast shown in these next photos.

The photographers were able to see a level of detail to the history of the building that is seldom seen by the public, like this blessing from the second President of the United States."

Delta Flight 1086, an MD-88 arriving from Atlanta, skidded off Runway 13 around 11:05 a.m., according to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.

The Port Authority confirmed that all 127 passengers and five crew members, ""were safely taken off plane.""

At least 28 passengers had non-life threatening injuries, of those injured five people were transported to hospitals, according to the Fire Department of New York.

The runway where the plane landed had been plowed just minutes before and two other pilots reported ""good braking action"" as they landed, according to Port Authority Executive Director Pat Foye.

Once the plane landed, it veered sharply left about 4,500 to 5,000 feet down the 7,000-foot runway, skidding off to the side and nearly ending up in the water, according to Foye.

An Instagram video shot shortly after the crash showed a man at the scene leaving in a stretcher.

LaGuardia's runways were closed for most of the day, but one runway reopened at 2 p.m., according to Foye.

Officials said they were checking for a fuel leak.

The National Transportation Safety Board announced it would send an investigator to secure the flight data recorders and document the damage.

Images of the plane taken by eyewitnesses showed that it apparently crashed through a fence after skidding off the runway.

""Customers deplaned via aircraft slides and have moved to the terminal on buses,"" Delta Airlines said in a statement. ""Our priority is ensuring our customers and crew members are safe. Delta will work with all authorities and stakeholders to look into what happened in this incident.""

Passengers on the plane included New York Giants tight end Larry Donnell, who said he was ""safe and sound"" after the crash.

""I feel fine physically and hopefully all the other passengers did not have any significant injuries,"" read a portion of Donnell's statement. ""We were all shocked and alarmed when the plane started to skid, but most importantly, as far as I know, all of the passengers and flight crew were able to exit the plane safely.""

An incredible photo was captured by passenger Jared Falleci from inside the plane just after it came to a stop. Falleci told ABC News he had no idea if the plane would stay out of the water as they skidded off the runway.

""I was holding on to the seat in front of me and I was praying,"" he told ABC News. ""It literally stopped a matter of feet, as you can see from the photos, from the water itself."""

Jeffrey Williams was arrested Saturday night and charged with two counts of first-degree assault, one count of firing a weapon from a vehicle and three counts of armed criminal action, said St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch. Williams was being held on $300,000 cash bond.

The two officers were injured early Thursday during heated protests outside the the police department after the resignation of the city's police chief, Tom Jackson, who stepped down in the wake of a Justice Department report that documented widespread racial bias in the city, biases that have gained national attention since the August police shooting of unarmed black teen Michael Brown.

Williams, 20, fired the shots from a car moving through the area, McCulloch said. It's unclear whether he meant to shoot the police officers, said McCulloch, since Williams told investigators he was involved in some sort of dispute prior to the shooting.

McCulloch said a handgun recovered from Williams matched shell casings found from the scene of the shooting.

It appears Williams was the only person who fired any shots, McCulloch said, but there may be other people who were ""participants."" The investigation is ongoing.

Attorney General Eric Holder released a written statement on the arrest today, saying it ""sends a clear message that acts of violence against our law enforcement personnel will never be tolerated.""

A statement on behalf of the Fraternal Order of Police in St. Louis said, ""We are relieved for our brother officers, their families and the people of Ferguson that this dangerous gunman is off the street and behind bars where he belongs.""

The city of Ferguson issued a statement expressing gratitude to the ""many citizens who provided assistance"" leading up to the arrest. As a result of today's announcement,"" the statement said, ""the city will continue its efforts, with the help of our residents and businesses, to embrace the healing which is needed to move forward.""

The National Fraternal Order of Police has set up a website for people to help the Shield of Hope, a charity dedicated to the welfare of law enforcement officers in the St. Louis metropolitan area.

Southern California authorities are looking to speak with Henry Solis, a probationary LAPD officer, in connection with the Friday killing of Salome Rodriguez Jr. in Pomona, about 30 miles east of Los Angeles, according to the Pomona Police Department.

Solis, 27, was off duty at the time of the shooting and then failed to report to work, police said.

According to Pomona police, Rodriguez and the suspect may have been in a physical altercation before the shooting. Rodriguez suffered gunshot wounds to the lower torso and was taken to USC Medical Center, where he died.

Rodriguez's cousin Barbara Lopez said, ""I've caught mom and dad breaking down, but they actually look a bit more at ease knowing that they have a person of interest,"" ABC's Los Angeles station KABC reported.

That's the advice, according to the world's oldest person, Misao Okawa, who turned 117 today.

Okawa, who was born in 1898 to a kimono maker, celebrated her birthday early on Wednesday at the Kurenai Nursing home in Osaka, Japan.

She donned a pink kimono with cherry blossom prints and a pink daisy pin in her hair.

And, of course, there was cake.

Asked for the secret to her long life, Okawa teased, ""I wonder about that too."" She's previously said the key is eating sushi and getting enough sleep, Guinness World Records reported.

The 117-year-old eats three large meals a day and makes sure she sleeps eight hours a night,Guinness World Records said, adding the nursing home's manager Tomohito Okada said her favorite meal is sushi, particularly mackerel on vinegar-steamed rice.

Okawa said she was ""very happy"" to be 117, though her time ""seemed rather short"" when Osaka government official Takehiro Ogura asked how she felt about living for 117 years. Ogura gave Okawa a big bouquet to mark the day.

In addition to holding the title of ""world's oldest person,"" Okawa is also one of few people who can call themselves a supercentenarian, a person 110-years-older or older.

""Reaching this age is an exceptional achievement, especially given the average life span for women in Japan is just under 85.9 years,"" Guinness World Records said.

""Misao has lived across three centuries,"" Guinness World Records added, ""which have seen immense social and technological advances including the advent of motor vehicles, flight, mobile telephones, social networking sites and six UK monarchs, four emperors of Japan and 20 US presidents.""

Okawa married her husband Yukio in 1919, and they had two daughters and one son. She now has four grandchildren and six great-grandchildren. Her husband died in 1931.

Bill Moore was 20 years old in 1944 when he wrote a letter to a young woman named Bernadean that he met while on furlough during the war, not knowing that he would go on to marry her.

The letter was found in the sleeve of a record that was purchased by a stranger in a thrift shop. The stranger went on a search to reunite the letter with its author.

Moore, now 90, now lives in an assisted care facility in Aurora, Colorado. His daughter was contacted shortly before Valentine's Day this year by the person who unintentionally bought the letter, and Moore was overcome with emotion when he read it for the first time in 70 years.

""I was really surprised because I would have no way of knowing that it would show up in the way it did,"" he told ABC News' Denver affiliate, KMGH.

Moore was fighting in Patton's Third Army at the time and what he didn't know when he wrote that letter was that he would go on to marry the woman he called ""my darling, lovable, alluring, Bernadean"" and have three children together.

They were married for 63 years before she died in 2010.

""I loved her ... she loved me and that's all I can tell you is the heartache of not being with her all the time,"" he told KMGH."
1BndN2s,2015-03-16 00:00:00,Robert Durst Says on HBO 'What the Hell Did I Do? Killed Them All' - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/US/robert-durst-hbo-hell-killed/story?id=29650536,"Robert Durst, the subject of both an HBO series and law enforcement scrutiny, asked himself off-camera in the closing moments of the final episode of the documentary that aired Sunday, “What the hell did I do?” before answering, “Killed them all, of course.”

Filmmakers asked Durst about similarities in handwriting in a letter he wrote and another linked to one of the killings to which he has been linked, The Associated Press reported, before he wore his microphone into the bathroom.

That’s when he apparently said to himself, ""There it is. You're caught"" and ""What the hell did I do? Killed them all, of course.""

The six-part HBO series ""The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst"" ended a day after Durst was arrested on a capital murder warrant issued by police in Los Angeles related to the death of his friend, Susan Berman, his attorney said today.

FBI agents believed Durst may have wanted to flee the country, possibly to Cuba, as he registered under an alias at the hotel, paid with cash, and was found with fake documents, said the source. According to nola.com, Saturday marked the first nonstop flight from New Orleans to Cuba since 1958.

The Los Angeles Police Department said today Berman's death has been under investigation since her body was found in her home on Christmas Eve in 2000.

""As a result of investigative leads and additional evidence that has come to light in the past year, investigators have identified Robert Durst as the person responsible for Ms. Berman's death,"" the LAPD said.

Durst appeared before a magistrate Sunday in New Orleans where he was ordered held without bond, according to the Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office. He has an extradition hearing scheduled for Monday.

""We will waive extradition in an attempt to expedite the process of getting into court in LA to answer and defend against the charges,"" Chip Lewis, Robert Durst’s attorney, told ABC News in a statement.

Durst's brother Douglas Durst said in a statement, ""We are relieved and also grateful to everyone who assisted in the arrest of Robert Durst. We hope he will finally be held accountable for all he has done.""

HBO said in a statement, ""We simply cannot say enough about the brilliant job that Andrew Jarecki and Marc Smerling did in producing The Jinx. Years in the making, their thorough research and dogged reporting reignited interest in Robert Durst's story with the public and law enforcement.""

The New York real estate heir has made national headlines as a person of interest or suspect in three deaths since 1982.

Durst has denied killing Berman, but some believed he had a motive, allegedly wanting to silence her about the 1982 disappearance of his first wife, Kathleen Durst, another death he has been investigated for but never charged. Berman was about to meet with investigators in New York about the disappearance of Kathleen Durst before she died.

Kathleen was officially declared dead in 2001, and Durst has said he has no idea what happened to her.

Durst was also charged in the 2001 killing of a neighbor in Galveston, Texas, but he claimed self-defense and was later found not guilty.

Durst, who participated in 25 hours of interviews for the HBO series, declined to comment to ABC News about the series.

1BNlBjm,2015-03-06 00:00:00,Jodi Arias Trial: Why Jury Couldn't Reach a Verdict - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/US/jodi-arias-trial-jury-reach-verdict/story?id=29417925,"All but one of the jurors tasked with deciding convicted killer Jodi Arias’ fate wanted to sentence her to death, they revealed today after the judge declared a mistrial.

There was one female juror who refused to sentence Arias to death for killing her boyfriend Travis Alexander, leading to an impasse and the hung jury.

“Eleven of us strived for justice for Travis, but to no avail,” one of the jurors said in a group audio news conference this morning. “We absolutely thought [the punishment] should be death.”

The jurors, with the exception of the holdout, spoke about their feelings on the case but did not want their names or faces revealed.

The apparent holdout, who was initially an alternate juror, seemed to come in with more knowledge about the case than others, having told the other jurors that she had seen “bits and pieces” of the Lifetime movie about Arias that aired after the initial trial.

“I think she came in and expected to see a monster in there because of what she saw on TV and the news and when she came in and saw it wasn’t,” one female juror said.

A male juror said he was angry with the holdout.

“I feel that the one holdout had her mind made up from the beginning and what angered me was the biggest thing that angered me was that she alluded that the death penalty would be a form of revenge,” he said.

They also revealed they sent a note to the judge requesting the consideration of an alternate to remove the holdout but that was denied, the jurors said.

The group was not always committed to sentencing Arias to death, with one juror explaining that during their initial deliberations they were split down the middle. But that evolved and led to all but one in support of capital punishment.

Now, Judge Sherry Stephens is tasked with deciding whether Arias should be sentenced to life in prison or life in prison with the possibility for parole in 25 years.

“We really feel like we made a huge effort into trying to get what we believe was deserved, and I cannot say enough how sorry I am,” one female juror said, breaking into tears mid-sentence.

The jurors who addressed the media appeared sympathetic to Alexander and his family, saying that “like they put Travis on trial, [and] focused on that rather than the reason we were there.”

All told the cost of the prosecution and Arias' public defense team was nearly $3,000,000 according to the Associated Press.

Tensions seemed high throughout the news conference, with several moments where jurors broke down in tears.

“I was emotionally struggling for five months,” one person said.

“We've had nightmares,” one female juror said. “I think every single one of us has had nightmares and I hope they go away.”"

He has been identified by French authorities as German citizen Andreas Lubitz, 27, and his actions in the final minutes of the flight are believed to have caused the crash, Brice Robin, Public Prosecutor of Marseille, said Thursday at a news conference.

“The intention was to destroy the plane,"" Robin said, speaking mostly in French.

French Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said that investigators are focused on Lubitz' background and motives, though they have started to rule out any connection to a larger plot.

""There is no evidence of any kind terrorist background,"" de Maiziere said in a statement released Thursday.

Lubitz was a member of a flight club called Luftsportclub Westerwald in his hometown of Montabaur, Germany.

""Andreas joined the club as an adolescent, he wanted to make his dream of flying come true,"" the club said in a statement released to ABC News.

""He was able to realize his dream, the dream he now has paid for so dearly with his own life,"" the statement said.

An airline spokeswoman said Lubitz had 630 hours of flight experience and only 100 of those hours were on this particular model of plane, an Airbus A320. By comparison, a U.S. first officer would be required to have at least 1,500 hours of experience to get hired by an airline.

Investigators have been able to listen to the audio recording from inside the cockpit and the captain can be heard leaving the cockpit and then tapping on the door to re-enter but being denied, Robin said.

The banging on the door grows louder while the co-pilot can be heard breathing throughout, he added, suggesting he was not incapacitated before the Tuesday crash that left 150 people dead.

Robin said the co-pilot had no reason not to allow the captain back into the cockpit and he should not have gone silent on the radio to air traffic control.

""When you commit suicide, you die alone,” Robin said in response to a question. “With 150 on the plane, I wouldn't call that suicide.”

Editor’s note: A French prosecutor initially said Lubitz was 28 years old but a law enforcement official later determined that he was 27."

Mayor Michael Collins suffered the heart attack at about 2 p.m. Sunday after leaving a store, his Executive Officer Lisa Ward told ABC affiliate WTVG-TV in Toledo.

Collins lost consciousness at the scene and a window had to be broken to get him out of the car, Ward said.

University of Toledo Medical Center cardiologist Dr. Christopher Cooper said it was too early to offer a prognosis.

At a news conference this evening, Cooper and city officials thanked the citizen who broke out the window when they saw the mayor was in trouble and provided CPR.

""I cannot express enough our deepest and most sincere appreciation for their efforts,"" Cooper said.

The procedure, laparoscopic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, was motivated by a family history of ovarian cancer. A small benign tumor was found on one ovary, but no other signs of cancer were uncovered, she wrote.

“Regardless of the hormone replacements I’m taking, I am now in menopause,” she wrote. “I will not be able to have any more children, and I expect some physical changes. But I feel at ease with whatever will come, not because I am strong but because this is a part of life. It is nothing to be feared.”

Previously, Jolie underwent preventative double mastectomy after a blood test showed a mutation in the BRCA1 gene.

In her op-ed, titled “Diary of a Surgery,” Jolie, 39, stated that tests showed elevated risks for cancer, forcing her to move up the surgery.

“I went through what I imagine thousands of other women have felt. I told myself to stay calm, to be strong, and that I had no reason to think I wouldn’t live to see my children grow up and to meet my grandchildren,” she wrote.

As a result of her surgery, Jolie received a progesterone IUD, which will help maintain hormonal balance – and prevent uterine cancer, she wrote.

It was brazen --literally a stone's throw from the famous Kremlin wall.

ABC News counted at least 18 security cameras in the immediate vicinity of the site where, according to Russia's Investigative Committee, Nemtsov was shot multiple times in the back and killed late Friday night. They are in plain sight. There may be many more we can't see.

Some of the cameras along the bridge and road belong to the Moscow City Council and the Kommersant newspaper reported that the cameras were switched off for repairs on Friday night. The council, though, has denied the report, insisting the cameras were fully functional. What they won't say is whether the footage shows the moment Nemtsov was killed.

The other cameras nearby belong to Russia's Federal Guard Service (FSO) and they line the Kremlin wall. ABC News could observe at least nine of them from the scene of the shooting.

In what might be an incredibly lucky turn for the gunman and accomplice, an FSO spokeswoman told ABC News today that none of those cameras were pointed at the bridge at the time and none of them captured the events of Friday night.

A video broadcast on Russian state TV does purport to show the moment that Nemtsov was gunned down as he walked across a bridge near the Kremlin.

However, the surveillance camera video is grainy and shot from far away, so that the figures walking across the bridge are barely discernible. And at the moment when TV Center, the station, which is controlled by the Moscow city government, said the shooting occurs, a snowplow blocks the view of the two people said to be Nemtsov and a companion.

ABC News has not independently confirmed the veracity of the video with the snowplow.

Russian news reports said that Nemtsov was walking with a female companion when a white car pulled up and fired on him before fleeing the scene.

Nemtsov was a former deputy prime minister under Boris Yeltsin during the 1990s, but fell out with the Russian president and formed Russia's People's Freedom Party.

The reason for the attack remains a mystery and no arrests have been made. Investigators said they were looking into several possible motives and have offered 3 million rubles -- nearly $50,000 -- for information about the shooting.

1BPhBdQ,2015-02-03 00:00:00,'American Sniper' Chris Kyle's Alleged Killer on Trial Next Week - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/US/texas-celebrates-chris-kyle-day-days-alleged-killers/story?id=28663876,"Today marks ""Chris Kyle Day"" in Texas as Gov. Greg Abbott made a proclamation in the Navy SEAL's honor this afternoon.

The announcement comes on the second anniversary of Kyle's death and on the week before the trial is scheduled to begin for his alleged killer, Eddie Ray Routh.

Details about the thorough jury selection process have been revealed just days ahead of the alleged killer's murder trial.

The two-step jury process selection begins on Thursday where the possible jurors will be asked questions about whether they have seen the movie ""American Sniper"" or read Kyle's autobiography of the same name.

Erath County District Court officials have allotted Thursday and Friday for the hundreds of jurors to fill out those questionnaires before returning on Monday and Tuesday for the second portion, which will consist of a standard voir dire questioning.

The judge told ABC News that 800 jurors have been summoned, and that large number is based off the expectation that only about half will show up.

If the selection process stays on this schedule, they will have 12 jurors and two alternates selected by next Tuesday afternoon, ready for opening statements Wednesday morning. The trial is expected to last for two weeks.

All parties involved in the case, including the selected jurors, will be placed under a gag order.

Kyle, the central character in the movie ""American Sniper,"" is widely recognized for having made the highest number of confirmed kills in American military history. He was fatally shot at a gun range in Texas in 2013, allegedly by Routh.

Since leaving the military in 2009, Kyle had spent time working with wounded veterans and, in some cases, he spent time with them on the shooting range.

""He was finding this real peace and joy being able to see his kids every day,"" his widow Taya Kyle told People Magazine in a recent interview.

That rehabilitation work is believed to have been the reason why he arranged for the trip to the gun range with his friend Chad Littlefield and Routh on Feb. 2, 2013.

Routh was arrested later that same day and charged with the murders of Kyle and Littlefield.

The trial was initially slated to begin last May but delays led to it be pushed back to start next week in Erath County, Texas.

The prosecution has said that they will not be seeking the death penalty.

One factor that will undoubtedly come up during the trial is Routh's mental health. His sister said during her frantic 911 call after he drove to her house from the gun range that he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder.

""My client will plead not guilty by reason of insanity,"" Routh's attorney, J. Warren St. John, told People Magazine last month.

St. John, who did not immediately respond to a request for comment from ABC News, has previously said he is concerned about getting an impartial jury, in part, due to the recent release of the film ""American Sniper,"" starring Bradley Cooper.

""The film will be an issue,"" St. John told People. ""I think any case with significant publicity has an issue with picking a jury. I've had them in the past, and anything that has significant national attention makes it hard to pick a jury.""

Routh's attorneys filed a motion in 2013 to change the location of the trial, but it was denied.

The State Highway Patrol reported that 21 passengers were transported to a nearby hospital by ambulance while 25 others were taken for treatment by bus, indicating that their injuries were less severe. According to EMS workers at the scene, all the injuries appeared to be minor.

There were 173 uninjured passengers who were taken by bus to to Richmond, the North Carolina Department of Transportation said.

The driver of the tractor-trailer has been identified as John Devin Black, of Claremont, N.C. and was not injured, authorities said, and the conductor of the Amtrak train has been identified as Keenan Talley, of Raleigh, N.C.

The Amtrak train operating from Charlotte to New York, ""struck a vehicle on the tracks at a grade crossing approximately 30 miles north of Rocky Mount, N.C.,"" Amtrak said in a statement to ABC News. ""There were 212 passengers and eight crew members on board and initial reports are that several passengers have been injured and taken to local medical facilities for treatment. At this time, none of the injuries have been reported as life-threatening. Local emergency responders are on the scene and an investigation is ongoing.""

Video from the scene shows that at least one cabin of the train derailed and flipped over on its side. The Federal Railway Authority later clarified that two of the train's seven cars and the locomotive derailed.

The trailer that the train struck was 164 feet long and was transporting an electrical building.

A witness to the crash said that the tractor-trailer appeared to be lingering on the tracks while trying to make a difficult right turn.

Leslie Cipriani told the Associated Press that the tractor-trailer tried backing up several times but did not make it before the grade crossing's cross bars hit the vehicle.

""A preliminary investigation has revealed that the driver of the truck and trailer attempted to negotiate a left turn at the intersection of NC 903 and US 301 which was preceded by a railroad crossing,"" North Carolina State Highway Patrol said in a statement.

""Due to the trailer’s length, the driver was unable to perform the left turn successfully onto US 301 north. The driver began to reposition the trailer by backing up in order to perform a wider turn. At that moment, the rail road crossing warning equipment was activated indicating an approaching Amtrak train. The driver attempted to pull forward but was subsequently struck by the approaching train. The impact caused the front two train compartments to derail.""

The Airbus crashed Tuesday in the Alps in southern France with 150 people on board, including two babies, the airline confirmed.

Recovery operations were suspended last night in France, with the intention of starting again today at daybreak.

A French Interior Ministry spokesperson said that bodies and debris would be brought down from the crash site this morning.

The crash took place in a remote part of the French Alps. French President Francois Hollande said there are ""apparently no survivors.""

The airline, a subsidiary of Lufthansa, said it cancelled seven flights Tuesday because crew members reported they were unfit to fly following the tragedy.

The passenger jet, an Airbus A320, crashed near the town of Digne as it traveled from Barcelona to Dusseldorf. The plane was carrying 144 passengers -- including 2 babies -- and six crew members, Germanwings CEO Thomas Winkelmann said at a news conference Tuesday.

One black box has been recovered, according to a spokesman for the French Interior Ministry. That box was en route to the Bureau d'Enquêtes et d'Analyses, the French authority in a Paris suburb responsible for safety investigations in civil aviation, authorities said.

Winkelmann said he feels ""deep sorrow,"" adding that the victims' families will be informed before a list of names will be released. The list of nationalities of the casualties will be released as soon as the airline is certain, Winkelmann added.

Hollande said, ""I want to express my solidarity to the family of the victims. We do not yet know the identities of the victims. It is a mourning we have to go through because it is a tragedy that has happened on our soil.""

Spanish King Felipe IV, who is in France for a pre-scheduled meeting with Hollande, said the passengers were German, Spanish and Turkish.

Germanwings said 67 Germans were on board. The State Department is reviewing whether there were any Americans on board.

King Felipe had planned to stay in France for three days but now said he is returning to Madrid to launch a crisis center.

The cause of the crash has not yet been determined, the Germanwings CEO said. The French Interior Ministry said the plane's black box has been found and that it will be analyzed in the coming hours.

Lufthansa, which owns Germanwings, called the crash ""an accident.""

""For the time being we are calling this an accident,"" a Lufthansa official said at a news conference in Barcelona Tuesday. ""Everything else is speculation.""

The Vatican said Pope Francis sent a telegram expressing his sadness over the crash, and adding that he is praying for the victims and their families.

At a White House news conference, President Obama offered his thoughts and prayers to the people of Germany and Spain, saying, ""American stands with them at this moment of sorrow.""

Obama said he has called German Chancellor Angela Merkel and hopes to speak with Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy of Spain to ""express the condolences of the American people"" and to offer U.S. assistance as they investigate this ""awful tragedy.""

""Our teams are in close contact, and we're working to confirm how many Americans may have been on board,"" Obama said.

Lufthansa released a statement Tuesday as reports emerged of the crash.

""If our fears are confirmed, this is a dark day for Lufthansa. We hope to find survivors,"" Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr said in the statement.

""...on 4U 9525. If our fears are confirmed, this is a dark day for Lufthansa. We hope to find survivors."" Carsten Spohr 2/2

Germanwings and Lufthansa have also darkened their logos on social media.

The plane was flying at 38,000 feet -- its normal cruising altitude -- when it started to lose altitude and descended for 8 minutes, according to Germanwings. When the plane was at 6,000 feet, it lost contact with French radar.

Lufthansa said the plane went into operation in 1990. It was sold to Lufthansa in 1991 and then sold to Germanwings in 2014.

1BPvvAY,2015-03-06 00:00:00,Vanished Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 Still a Mystery 1 Year Later - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/International/vanished-malaysia-air-flight-mh370-mystery-year/story?id=29443649,"A year after it vanished, there still is no trace of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370, which many believe disappeared into the abyss of the Indian Ocean.

Theories of what happened to the plane have been swirling ever since, but no one really knows what occurred.

""I am a little surprised that we haven’t had something wash up on a beach that would tell us, yes, the airplane was in pieces, and was in the water,"" said John Nance, ABC News aviation contributor. ""I think that is still probably going to happen.""

The Boeing 777 left Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, en route to Beijing on March 8, 2014, when it lost contact with air traffic control as it flew over the Gulf of Thailand. The jet had 227 passengers, most of whom were Chinese, along with 12 crew members.

Here are some of the many open questions a year later:

Investigators believe the plane flew thousands of miles off course before crashing into the Indian Ocean. Australian officials still looking for the plane or its remnants say they are focusing on a search area of approximately 23,000 square miles west of the Australian city of Perth, and hope to find something that will provide answers to the plane's fate.

""The flight data recorder might be very helpful, certainly -- very helpful in terms of how the airplane entered the water,"" Nance said.

Malaysian authorities say the plane disappeared about an hour after it took off. However, no one is sure where the plane crashed, or even if it crashed at all. Some believe the plane is located in the southern part of the Indian Ocean, while others believe it flew into the northern part.

Speculation that the plane went north doesn't make sense to Nance, because it discounts evidence from satellite tracking systems. He added that finding the plane may be difficult because the southern Indian Ocean is a large body of water that is mostly unmapped.

Australia said it will continue to search for the plane.

Australian Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss said in a statement to Reuters on Sunday, ""We clearly cannot keep searching forever, but we want to do everything that's reasonably possible to locate the aircraft.""

Truss's office added it was optimistic about finding the plane, given that over 40 percent of the priority search area has already been covered.

If the plane isn't found by the completion of the search, the deputy prime minister’s office told Reuters, discussions will then be had between Australia, Malaysia and China about what to do next.

“If at the end of the search, there is nothing that has been found, I think it’s going to be very difficult for everybody,” Nance said.

The father of Mohammed Emwazi, who was questioned recently in Kuwait, told authorities the family last heard from his son in mid-2013 when the younger Emwazi called them from Turkey. Emwazi said he was going to do humanitarian work in Syria, the father said, according to the officials. Emwazi's father, a former policeman, said he's been waiting for news of his son's death ever since.

Instead of doing humanitarian work, Emwazi allegedly linked up with ISIS and has appeared in videos online apparently beheading Westerners, including several who were actual humanitarians. Late Tuesday, a British newspaper reported Emwazi's father had denied the Kuwaiti officials' claims that his wife recognized their son's voice in the videos.

Ever since, a complex picture is emerging of the alleged murderer's life before ISIS. Born in Kuwait, Emwazi moved with his family to London when he was a boy.

A school picture captured what appeared to be an angelic smile, but a teacher told the BBC Emwazi had anger management issues, for which he eventually went to therapy.

A former boss of Emwazi's in Kuwait, when Emwazi briefly lived there in 2010, told The Guardian that Emwazi was a stellar employee, ""calm and decent.""

""He was the best employee we ever had,"" the former boss said of the then 21-year-old.

Even later, a member of the British activist group CAGE told reporters he saw Emwazi as a ""beautiful young man.""

But at the same time, Emwazi was linked by court documents to a number of alleged jihadists in London who purportedly supported a terror group in Somalia.

In recent years Emwazi had attempted to move back to Kuwait to pursue a computer science job there but was denied entry, according to an official with CAGE, with whom he corresponded. Instead, Emwazi is alleged to have eventually gone to join ISIS.

Now, a former ISIS fighter says Emwazi is being used by the terror group.

""ISIS play him like a piano, a celebrity to attract our Muslim brothers in Europe,"" the fighter told the BBC. ""But some think he is showing off, they think he is being used by ISIS.""

The fighter described Emwazi as cold and ""strange"" when the two met in Syria.

Still, Emwazi is a high-value target for American and coalition airstrikes. But authorities told ABC News he has been careful to avoid using computers or his cell phone, which could give away his location.

[Editor's Note: This report has been updated to reflect that officials were referencing Emwazi's father's statements to them. It is unclear if his mother was interviewed as well."

Hiram Jimenez was seeking damages from an incident that took place at an Applebee’s in Westampton, New Jersey, on March 4, 2010.

According to the ruling by the Superior Court of New Jersey, Jimenez says his steak fajita was served to him in a “sizzling skillet” which was placed “right in front of [him]” by a waitress.

While praying with his brother, Jimenez said he bowed his head “[c]lose to the table” -- then heard a loud sizzling noise, “a pop of noise,” then felt a burning sensation in his left eye and face.

In a panic, Jimenez also “knocked his plate onto his lap” and “pulled something in his right arm” when he tried pushing himself away from the table.

In an incident report with Applebee’s, Jimenez said that he received “several burns to the face, neck, and arms.”

The lawsuit was dismissed by a trial judge because he found that the restaurant “had no duty to war against a danger that is open and obvious.”

Jimenez appealed, but the two New Jersey judges came to the same conclusion.

Jimenez’s attorney, Richard Wiener, could not be reached for comment."

1BQepof,2015-03-03 00:00:00,'Sound of Music' 50th Anniversary: The Real von Trapps Reflect on the Iconic Film - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/sound-music-50th-anniversary-real-von-trapps-reflect/story?id=29272951,"""The Sound of Music"" turns 50 today and is still just as iconic as ever, decades after Julie Andrews starred as Maria in the 1965 classic.

""What blows my mind is how much it's continued and how much people still value the story,"" Myles von Trapp Derbyshire, 30, told ABC News. ""And the people that I meet, how much it's affected their lives. It's great to be part of a story that's proven itself to be timeless.""

Myles is the great-grandson of Maria von Trapp, one of the main, real-life inspirations for the movie, and believes her story ""is about being strong and facing adversity head on.""

""Here we are 50 years later and people are still interested,"" he added. ""Lady Gaga is performing at the Oscars and it's still relevant.”

In the classic movie, Maria leaves a convent during World War II and falls in love with Captain Georg von Trapp. The family, including the children, leave Austria during the war to escape the Nazis.

The film also focuses on the family's musical gifts and occupation as traveling singers. Maria von Trapp, who died in 1987, was the matriarch of the Trapp Family Singers.

Since ""The Sound of Music"" is based on a true story, Myles recalls the times he would visit the actual Trapp Family Lodge in Stowe, Vermont, and how that family landmark came about.

""After they came to the U.S., they were broke, because they had to leave everything behind in Austria,"" Myles told ABC News. ""They decided on Vermont, it reminded them most of Austria with the green mountains and all. They bought a farm and turned that into music camp.""

While Myles may not have too many memories of his great-grandmother, his mother, Stephanie, 55, remembers Maria.

""She was my grandmother,"" she told ABC News. ""[We would visit] once a year. We would go for a family trip to the Trapp Family Lodge, which was her house. It was a big deal, because we would get out of school early! And we'd have a ball.""

With the von Trapp family being the inspiration for the Oscar-winning film, some elements were exaggerated for dramatic effect.

""The whole relationship with Rolf was added, that did not exist,"" he said of one of the von Trapp children having a relationship with a young Nazi in the movie. ""He's a made-up character. My grandfather was actually the eldest child. So the relationship there with one of the Nazis didn't exist. They didn't climb every mountain, they hopped on a train to Italy when it came to the Nazis pursuing my great-grandfather.""

He added, ""The house itself [in Austria, which was a mansion in the film] was not this grand, huge thing. They lived very humbly for several years before they left Austria and came to the US. ... The personalities of Georg and Maria are also actually reversed.

“My great-grandfather was very sweet and kind, Maria was apparently very moody,"" he said, laughing.

Stephanie says Maria “wasn't your snugly grandmother, but she was fun. I'll never forget, she wanted to take us to the local soft serve ice cream place. She was trying to describe how tall the ice cream cone was and she was very excited. She took us in her convertible Volkswagen Karmann Ghia. We got ice cream and I just remember that was awesome.”

What the movie got exactly right was ""they did sing, stuff about my great-grandfather Georg and him being a naval captain, and being knighted is all true.""

Myles von Trapp Derbyshire

Myles doesn't remember the first time he saw it but has an amazing memento that he cherishes.

""There's a picture of me sitting on my grandfather's lap watching the movie when I was 4 years old,"" he said. ""You can see Julie Andrews dancing through the mountains and me on his lap.""

Stephanie von Trapp Derbyshire

Stephanie remembers, and though she's excited now, at 5 years old, she admits she ""didn't get it.""

""I remember going to the theater. I remember thinking, 'Why was this so special?' I didn't quite connect the fact that we were von Trapps and the people in the movie were von Trapps. I didn't get that,"" she said."
1bqMKOZ,2015-03-24 00:00:00,President Obama Announces Slowdown of Troop Withdrawal From Afghanistan - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/president-obama-announces-slowdown-troop-withdrawal-afghanistan/story?id=29872075,"President Obama has agreed, at Afghan President Ashraf Ghani's request, to slow the planned withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan, leaving 9,800 in place through 2015.

“This flexibility reflects our reinvigorated partnership with Afghanistan, which is aimed at making Afghanistan more secure and preventing it from being used to launch terrorist attacks,” Obama said.

While the U.S. will now leave more troops in place over the next several months than was previously expected, Obama said the decision ""has not changed"" his goal to end the war by the end of 2016.

Obama’s announcement came after he and Ghani spent the morning meeting at the White House.

Obama has pledged to end the United States’ longest war by the end of 2016, pulling out all but roughly 1,000 of the almost 10,000 U.S. troops now in the country.

The president also repeated his administration's intent to provide funding for an Afghan security force of 352,000 troops through 2017.

“America’s combat mission in Afghanistan may be over but our commitment to the Afghan people, that will endure,” Obama said.

While the U.S. had planned to withdraw roughly half of its troops by the end of this year, Ghani reportedly wanted all U.S. troops to remain in place through next year to support Afghan security forces.

Ghani’s first trip to Washington as president is also an opportunity to publicly cement the strategic relationship between the new Afghan government and the U.S. after years of rocky relations under President Hamid Karzai.

Unlike his predecessor, who had a strained relationship with Obama and was often harshly critical of U.S. policies, Ghani is seen as “clearly more cooperative,” Jeff Eggers, senior director for Afghanistan and Pakistan at the National Security Council, told reporters last week.

“There is a clearly positive vision now for Afghanistan that President Ghani holds,” Eggers said. “And it’s important, I think, that our leadership and the audience here in Washington sees that qualitatively different relationship and that more positive vision.”

Ghani’s five-day trip has been packed with high-level meetings. In addition to meeting with Obama in the Oval Office today, Ghani had a full day of discussions at Camp David Monday with Secretary of State John Kerry, Defense Secretary Ashton Carter and Treasury Secretary Jack Lew.

On Wednesday, Ghani will address a joint meeting on Congress and, on Thursday, he will meet with world leaders at the United Nations."

A vocal critic of Vladimir Putin, Nemstov was gunned down while crossing a bridge with his girlfriend near the Kremlin on Friday night.

Alex Navalny, another opposition leader, was banned from attending the funeral along with several EU politicians.

In line to pay their respects, several mourners doubted the criminal investigation would result in justice.

No arrests have been made and no motive has been established.

""His death represented that there are no limits for those who want to destroy any other opinion in the country except the Kremlin's,"" one mourner told ABC news."

The French swimmer won the gold medal at the 2012 Olympics, setting an Olympic record in the 400-meter freestyle.

The medal-winning run was marked by power and efficiency and grace, her limbs slicing through the water with machine-like might. When the race was complete, Muffat stuck out her tongue and hugged her teammate, a defining accomplishment for the then-22-year-old.

The Olympic highlight drew renewed attention Monday after news emerged that Muffat, 25, and seven others perished when their helicopters collided while filming a  reality-TV show in northwest Argentina. Other victims included Olympic boxer Alexis Vastine and champion sailor Florence Arthaud.

The sports figures were part of a team filming the reality show ""Dropped,"" a survivalist program with several versions across Europe. News of the deaths sent the French sports world into mourning.

""The brutal demise of our compatriots is an immense sadness,"" French President Francois Hollande said in a statement.

Muffat’s addition to the TV program was announced about two weeks ago. She had participated in various events and causes since retiring from swimming last year, a retirement she partially attributed to a dispute with her coach.

“I have taken a big decision to stop swimming,” she said in 2014, according to the French newspaper L’Equipe, translated by Agence France-Presse. “[The disagreement with coach Fabrice Pellerin] will stay between us like many other things, good or bad, but I mention that because that was what started things off.”

The helicopters crashed while flying near Villa Castelli in La Rioja province, about 730 miles northwest of Buenos Aires, La Rioja Secretary of Security Cesar Angulo told television station TN. ""An explosion occurred and it's believed that they collided,"" Angulo said.

Photographs showed the burning and smoking wreckage of the helicopters on the ground in dry scrubland with people gathered nearby.

The crew had arrived Sunday in Villa Castelli, where it had previously filmed a version of the show for Switzerland and Denmark, Villa Castelli Mayor Andres Navarrete said.

Both Argentine pilots, identified as Juan Carlos Castillo and Roberto Abate, died in the crash.

""The causes of the crash are not known,"" Navarrete told radio station Cadena 3.

Following the crash, the show's broadcaster TF1 released a statement.

""We have learned, with great sadness, the accident on the set of the show 'Dropped,'"" the statement reads. ""[Chief Executive Officer] Nonce Paolini and all TF1 teams come together in this terrible time of pain for the families and relatives of the victims.""

Vastine, 28, won a boxing bronze medal at the 2008 games in Beijing in the 60-64 kilogram category, but his semifinal loss to Manuel Felix Diaz was marred in controversy as he was docked points by the referee in the final round. Vastine broke down in tears after the defeat.

Arthaud, 57, won the 1990 Route du Rhum, a prestigious yacht race between Brittany and the Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe, a triumph in the male-dominated sport. Her athletic successes followed a serious car accident at age 17 that left her in a coma.

The death of Muffat was felt in the United State: Many U.S. swimmers had raced against her. As initial reports of the tragedy emerged online, swimmers reflected on Twitter, honoring a fallen competitor.

Shocked and saddened to hear of Camille Muffat's passing. An incredible athlete and an inspiration to us all. #RIP

Rest in peace, Camille Muffat

Fellow swimmers Monday reflected on Muffat’s presence.

""Camille was quite a shy and reserved person. She was discreet. But when it was time for a bit of a laugh she was always there,"" Olympic gold medalist Amaury Leveaux said. ""French sport has lost a great champion.""

But at a Tuesday night event, she did weigh in on another important issue: the infamous white and gold/ blue and black dress that recently took social media by storm.

“Now, I want to answer one question right at the start before it stirs up Twitter. People have read a lot of different things into my pantsuits,” Clinton quipped. “Despite what you might think, this outfit is not actually white and gold.”

Speaking to one of the friendliest possible audiences -- at an event sponsored by the pro-Democrat, pro-women PAC Emily’s List -- the likely 2016 presidential candidate vowed to “beat this drum as long and as loud as it takes” to pass policies like paid family leave and equal pay for women.

“We’ve heard Republicans try to sing out of the same hymnal, talking about income inequality – it’s like watching the end of ‘Casablanca,’” Clinton lamented.

The former First Lady, who admitted she was “still kind of in the grandmother glow” following the birth of her granddaughter, Charlotte, addressed 2016 speculation only indirectly:

“Along life’s way, you get the chance to make millions of decisions. Some of them are big, like, do you run for office?” she said, to tumultuous applause.

“Others are even bigger,” she continued, “like the ones that Gabby Giffords and her husband, Mark, confronted, like, what do you do when a murderer attacks you and you survive?”

(Former Rep. Gabby Giffords, D-Ariz., who took a bullet to the head during a 2011 shooting in Tucson, was in attendance.)

“Don’t you someday want to see a woman president?” Clinton teased the audience.

And based on their response, it's safe to say their answer was yes.

The plane, Flight TK726, was carrying 238 people and coming from Istanbul when the accident happened.

Passengers slid to safety on emergency slides.

The airline released a statement following the incident, stating that one passenger was slightly injured and taken to a hospital for treatment.

“The technical examination will determine the cause of the incident,” the statement read.

The runway was slippery after two days of rain and there was dense fog at the time. The plane was stuck in the grass and there was some damage to the front of the Airbus 330.

The plane circled for half an hour over Nepal before making a second attempt to land. The airport -- Nepal’s only international airport -- remained closed Wednesday morning after the accident.

""There is no evidence upon which prosecutors can rely to disprove Wilson's stated subjective belief that he feared for his safety,"" the DOJ criminal report said.

According to the report, Wilson ""saw Brown reach his right hand under his t-shirt into what appeared to be his waistband.""

Accounts that Brown put his hands up are ""inaccurate because they are inconsistent with the physical and forensic evidence,"" the report says.

Witness accounts were ""inconsistent"" and ""changed over time,"" it also said.

""The promise I made when I went to Ferguson and at the time that we launched our investigation was not that we would arrive at a particular outcome, but rather that we would pursue the facts, wherever they led,"" said US Attorney General Eric Holder. ""Our investigation has been both fair and rigorous from the start. It has proceeded independently of the local investigation that concluded in November. And it has been thorough: as part of a wide-ranging examination of the evidence, federal investigators interviewed and re-interviewed eyewitnesses and other individuals claiming to have relevant information and independently canvassed more than 300 residences to locate and interview additional witnesses.""

Holder added, ""This conclusion represents the sound, considered, and independent judgment of the expert career prosecutors within the Department of Justice. I have been personally briefed on multiple occasions about these findings. I concur with the investigative team’s judgment and the determination about our inability to meet the required federal standard.""

The Justice Department also released its investigation of the Ferguson police, which found a pattern and practice of discriminatory policing.

The report includes seven racist emails sent by Ferguson officers. In its review, the Justice Department found 161 use of force complaints against the Ferguson police from 2010 to 2014. Only one case was founded and no officer was disciplined.

Those conclusions came nearly seven months after a confrontation with Wilson that left Brown dead. In the wake of the controversial slaying of unarmed teenager Trayvon Martin, Brown’s death reignited a national debate over race in America and sparked protests across the country.

With its findings now public, the Justice Department is likely to seek agreement from the Ferguson police department to implement serious changes to its practices. But if negotiations fail, then the Justice Department would likely file a civil lawsuit against the police force, hoping a federal judge will force the police department to enact appropriate changes.

In a news conference late today, Ferguson Mayor James Knowles said the city has cooperated with the DOJ, received the results of the investigation and has already acted on changes, including diversity training for police and African-American hires. The city immediately placed three employees who allegedly sent racially-charged emails on administrative leave. One of the three has been fired and the fate of the others awaits the results of an internal investigation. ""That type of behavior will not be tolerated,"" Knowles said. ""We must do better not only as a city but as a state and country.""

The LAPD had identified the man as Charley Saturmin Robinet, a convicted bank robber who carried a French passport.

But Astrid le Moine, Press Attaché for the Consulate General of France in Los Angeles, said the French consulate later notified police of the usage of the stolen identity.

Arnaud Guillois, the press counselor at the French Embassy in Washington, told ABC News that the homeless man killed on Skid Row ""is not French."" French officials do not know the man's nationality at this time, Guillois said.

A call to the LAPD Tuesday seeking comment wasn't immediately returned.

Court documents confirm that the man who used the name Charley Saturmin Robinet was released from federal prison on May 12, 2014 after serving 14 years in prison. According to the Associated Press, the 2000 incident involved Robinet holding up a Wells Fargo to steal money to pay for acting classes.

A law enforcement source confirmed to ABC News that Robinet was 39 at the time of his death.

A 2005 court document notes that a state psychiatrist examined him and determined that he had a ""mental disorder or defect"" but it was unclear if he received treatment.

Witnesses at the shooting scene told KABC that the man was called ""Africa"" by people who knew him. The shooting took place on the city's Skid Row, a stretch of Central Los Angeles where many of the city's homeless congregate.

Footage obtained by ABC News shows Robinet entering his tent on the sidewalk shortly before police arrive at the scene.

At least two investigations into the shooting are underway."

Sixteen pages of screenshots showing the text messages were sent to the Baltimore Post Examiner, which included ones saying ""can we just kill them?"" and ""kill the freshman.""

Another message said that during practice, the sender would be ""aiming for her [teammate's] shins.""

""They were extreme threats of violence. There were texts of variety of wanting to kill certain people,"" said Bryan Renbaum, a reporter with the Baltimore Post Examiner who obtained the text messages. ""It was ugly.""

A player who saw the texts turned them over to coaches, who then alerted school authorities, according to Renbaum.

""The texts were sent to me by concerned parties who ... were worried that the school did not take sufficient action to protect the players,"" he said.

Mackenzie Reese, Alyssa Semones, Amber Kovalick, Meghan Milani and Brittany Marquess have since been suspended, UMBC athletic director Tim Hall said Monday.

The players have missed two games so far -- last Wednesday against Drexel and Saturday against Manhattan -- but were allowed on the sidelines to cheer.

""The allegations from the sources I received were that they cheered when several of the freshman players fumbled or were injured,"" said Renbaum.

Four of the five players apologized in a statement issued on their behalf, saying, ""Words cannot express our sense of regret and disappointment in ourselves … we have been, and continue to be, focused on working privately with university leadership to move forward. Our goal is to humbly work through this difficult situation.""

The university said in a statement: ""The UMBC community highly values civility and respect, and we take this matter very seriously."" The team has since practiced without contact drills.

""It isn't who UMBC is at all and certainly is disappointing,"" said Hall.

The hospital where Brown, 21, had been since she was found unresponsive in her bathtub Saturday confirmed to ABC News today that she was no longer a patient. Brown has been moved to a different hospital, but details of where or when this took place were not given.

On Monday, the family of Brown's late mother, Whitney Houston, released a statement to ABC News, saying, “Bobbi Kristina is fighting for her life and is surrounded by immediate family. As her father already stated, we are asking you to honor our request for privacy during this difficult time. Thank you for your prayers, well wishes, and we greatly appreciate your continued support.""

Brown, an aspiring actress and singer, is the daughter of Bobby Brown and Houston. Her husband, Nick Gordon, and a friend found her Saturday, face down in her tub, authorities said. Police arrived that morning and performed lifesaving measures until rescue personnel arrived, according to officials.

Meanwhile, Bobby Brown has also asked for privacy.

Bobbi Kristina Brown’s mother died almost three years ago, on Feb. 11, 2012, in a similar fashion. Houston was found unresponsive in a tub in Beverly Hills and died shortly thereafter.

Brown had been vocal of late in her ambitions to follow in her famous mother's footsteps.

The town is called Salinas and if you ask anyone in the country about Salinas -- the one close to Barahona because there are four -- you will hear two tales: One is how some of the people there were born with a rare condition that made their feet look like lobster feet. And the other tale is of how a number of children were presumably born as girls and later turned into boys once they hit puberty. They were called guevedoces, or “penis at 12.”

To the best of the villagers’ knowledge they looked like girls at birth and were raised that way. But as they got older, their voices deepened and it was discovered they had testicles, eventually turning into adult men. Doctors from Cornell University in upstate New York traveled there to study some of the children with this medical anomaly, even bringing some of them back to the states for research.

I traveled the rural roads of Dominican Republic in search of the mystery town.

Upon my arrival, I saw a group of people sitting in the shade of a tree. And they were not surprised that a Dominican-American journalist was asking about the guevedoces.

One of them was barefoot man and his foot looked like a lobster -- making at least one of the tales I had heard true.

Back in Salinas, I was hoping to interview one of the guevedoces. I was told that when doctors took some of them to the U.S. for research, most of them used it as an opportunity to stay -- never returning to Salinas.

The women in the group were more eager to talk than the men. Maria Felis remembers vividly when doctors from the United States came to the town taking some of guevedoces to New York.

“There aren’t so many now as there were before,” ahe explained. “I remember when the last two brothers left in 1989. They never told us why there were so many children born that way.”

“There was a baby born like the guevedoces last year,” Maria added, “but the mother would be too embarrassed to talk.”

I was very familiar with this response. I have come across numerous parents in the United States with intersex children and most of them felt the same way.

“It’s an important story and I want to help,” one mother told me, “but I am worried what people will think of my child.”

Another woman, Josefa Cuevos, recalled one of her childhood friends. “I remember when one was born… then she grew up changed her name and started to live as a man.”

In today’s terminology the guevedoces are intersex, and it’s a condition that affects American children as well.

About one in every 2,000 babies are born intersex each year in the United States alone, according to the National Institutes of Health, but they don’t always stay that way forever. Many undergo gender assignment surgery to assign them one gender over the other.

In our upcoming ""Nightline"" report, we follow the journey of Saifa Wall, who was born with ambiguous genitalia like the guevedoces. But instead of letting him grow into his sex, doctors assigned him female at birth and removed his testicles at the age of 13.

For the first time, Saifa, who is now 35 years old, came face-to-face with the pediatric surgeon, Dr. Terry Hensle, who performed his gender assignment surgery almost 20 years ago at Saifa’s parents’ request, deciding his sex with Saifa's mother's consent, which Saifa says was the wrong gender for him."

The Butler County Sheriff’s Office posted an alert on Facebook Tuesday about Andrew Dale Marcum, 21, who was wanted on a range of charges, including burglary (safe-cracking), abduction, assault and domestic violence.

Residents commented on the post. So did Marcum, apparently.

“I ain’t tripping half of them don’t even know me,” Marcum wrote from his Facebook account.

The sheriff’s office responded: “If you could stop by the Sheriff’s Office, that’d be great.”

County Sheriff Richard K. Jones also weighed in, posting a photo on Twitter showing a jail cell.

“Hey Andrew Marcum we’ve got your room ready ...” Jones wrote.

Hey Andrew Marcum we've got your room ready... pic.twitter.com/iYkANLD9hZ

“Andrew Dale Marcum will be off Facebook temporarily, because there is no social media access in the Butler County Jail. He's turned himself in,” the office wrote in a new Facebook post. “Thanks to our Facebook and Twitter friends for helping turn up the heat.”"

Would I be happy working for this person?

""I will only hire someone to work directly for me if I would work for that person,"" Zuckerberg told a group in Barcelona who participated in the Facebook co-founder's monthly town hall meeting. ""It's a pretty good test.""

One of those people who passed the test was clearly Facebook's Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg.

When asked by a woman in the audience what it is like to work with Sandberg, Zuckerberg said he considered her a mentor and someone who has been instrumental in building Facebook into a business and ""healthy organization.""

Zuckerberg was in Barcelona for the Mobile World Congress where he spoke about the strides his Internet.org initiative has made in the developing world since he first announced its launch on year ago.

More than 7 million people in developing countries have benefited so far from having Internet access from their phones, according to Zuckerberg. With 50 million people living in the countries that are covered by the app, that number is likely to increase."
1BTlU8o,2015-04-02 00:00:00,"Kenya: 147 Killed in University Attack, Officials Say - ABC News",http://abcnews.go.com/International/kenya-university-campus-stormed-attackers-dozens-injured/story?id=30059930,"The death toll in the attack on a Kenyan university by extremists has risen sharply to 147 people, as the operation to free hostages being held in a dormitory there ended with the deaths of four “terrorists” involved, Kenyan officials said. The number of casualties makes it one of the deadliest terror attacks in the country's recent history.

The al Qaeda-affiliated terror group al-Shabab claimed responsibility for the assault earlier today. In addition to the four purportedly killed, Kenyan authorities said another suspect was taken into custody.

Most of the victims were students, Kenyan Interior Minister Joseph Nkaissery said, but two policemen, a soldier and two watchmen were also killed.

The attack began at about 5:30 a.m. local time today at Garissa University College, which is located near the country's border with Somalia, and lasted more than 13 hours. The violence started as students were preparing for their morning prayers.

An unidentified student, recounting the attack to Kenya's Citizen TV, said the chaos sent innocent citizens running into harm's way.

""Guys started jumping up and down, running for their lives, but it's unfortunate that where they were going to is where the gunshots were coming from,"" the student said.

The gunmen allegedly killed scores before they were cornered, with dozens of other hostages, in a dormitory by Kenyan authorities.

The gunmen had strapped themselves with explosives and, when they were shot, the attackers blew up ""like bombs,"" Nkaissery said.

The death toll rose in jumps throughout the day, from 15 to 70 to the most recent count of 147, which was reported on Twitter by Kenya's Disaster Operations Centre.

As of last week authorities had apparently warned of a potential terror attack targeting campuses, according to a flyer posted at the University of Nairobi and other schools at the capital, more than 200 miles away from Garissa.

""Intelligence reports indicate that the [al-Shabab] terror group is planning retaliatory attacks on vital installations in Nairobi including a major university,"" the March 25 flyer said. It asked all students and staff there to ""continue being vigilant and diligent while in the University and other crowded places.""

A spokesman for al-Shabab previously told the BBC the gunmen had released 15 Muslim students.

An al-Shabab commander, Mohamed Mohamud, was identified by the Interior Ministry as a ""mastermind"" of the attack and there is a reward of more than $200,000 apparently for information leading to his arrest.

Based out of Somalia and affiliated with al Qaeda, al-Shabab was behind the attack on the Westgate mall in Nairobi in 2013 that killed 67.

Last month, a U.S. drone strike killed an al-Shabab leader, believed to have been behind the Westgate attack.

America's Ambassador to Kenya, Robert Godec, said in a written statement that the U.S. ""offer[s] our profound appreciation and gratitude to the members of the Kenyan security services who are risking their lives to end this cowardly attack.""

""We stand shoulder to shoulder with the government and people of Kenya in the effort to end the scourge of terrorism,"" Godec said.

“We’re all going to come face to face with unbearable grief, loss and pain caused by a series of senseless, horribly misguided acts carried out by two brothers, 26-year-old Tamerlan Tsarnaev and his younger brother, 19-year-old Dzhokhar,” defense attorney Judy Clarke told the court. “We do not and will not at any point in this case sidestep or attempt to sidestep Dzhokhar’s responsibility for his actions. We think the question of ‘why’ is important.”

Clarke said it was that facet, the motive behind the deadly bombing, where the defense disagrees with the prosecution. Tamerlan Tsarnaev, Clarke said, was the one “who self-radicalized” and the defense plans to show evidence that Dzhokhar was “enlisted” by his older brother. The defense team gave a hint of a similar potential strategy a year ago when they filed motions to obtain information the attorneys believed would show that between the brothers, Tamerlan was an “all-powerful force who could not be ignored or disobeyed.”

Earlier today U.S. District Judge George O'Toole seemed to strike a blow to such a defense, telling the court that whether Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is more or less culpable than his late brother is not relevant.

Dzhokhar has pleaded not guilty to the 30 counts against him, including charges of using a “weapon of mass destruction resulting in death.” He watched impassively, at times rubbing his stubble and goatee, as the pain of his horrific crimes was described to the jury during the prosecution's opening remarks.

The trial comes just under two years after twin explosions ripped through the crowd near the finish line of the Boston Marathon in April 2013, killing three people – including an eight-year-old boy – and injuring some 260 others. More than a dozen of those injured lost limbs.

Prosecutors say Dzhokhar and his older brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev were responsible for the death and destruction, and that the two were photographed dropping backpacks holding the bombs before the blasts. The city of Boston was paralyzed for days during an intense manhunt, during which the pair allegedly gunned down an MIT police officer.

Tamerlan was eventually killed in a shootout with police days after the attack in the Boston suburb of Watertown.

Dzhokhar was caught hours later, bloody and hiding in a dry-docked boat. While hiding, Tsarnaev penned an anti-American missive on the wall of the boat, saying, ""The U.S. government is killing our innocent civilians, but most of you already know that.”

""We Muslims are one body. You kill one of us, you hurt [unintelligible] us all,” another section of the note read.

After opening statements, the prosecution will immediately force jurors to relive the emotional pain of the marathon attack. The first three dozen witnesses are expected to be bombing victims: amputees and others who were maimed along with the father of Martin Richard, the eight-year-old killed when Dzhokhar Tsarnaev allegedly planted a backpack containing a pressure cooker bomb at the boy’s feet. Their testimony will be followed by others impacted by the blasts, including Marathon organizers and business owners along Boylston Street where the finish line was.

Many survivors of the bombing are watching the proceedings on television from a separate, nearby courtroom.

Stories of Terror From the Finish Line

One of the first witnesses called by the prosecution, Shane O’Hara, managed the Marathon Sports store near the blasts. The court was shown video of panic inside the store after the explosions when people streamed inside seeking shelter.

O’Hara testified that people were trying to attend to the injured, using the store’s merchandise as makeshift tourniquets.

“The thing that haunts me is making decision is who needed help first, who needed help more,” O’Hara said.

Later the court was shown graphic video of the immediate aftermath of the explosions, filmed by the third witness called, Colton Kilgore. Kilgore’s mother-in-law was running the marathon and when the bombs detonated, he said he was “blown through the air.”

Kilgore testified there was smoke and shrapnel and what he described as an “acrid, disgusting smell.”

Next was wrenching, visceral testimony from Sydney Corcoran, a 19-year-old of Lowell, Mass. who was 17 and a high school senior when she attended her first marathon to see her aunt run. She was near the finish line only briefly before “everything went up in smoke.”

""I remember having my mom to the right of me and she was so happy for my aunt that she was just trying to get any type of view. My dad was a little bit behind us to our left. We're just waiting for her to cross and next thing I know we're immersed in smoke and our ears, it's like leaving a concert and having a ringing in your ears and everything is muffled,” she said.

“I immediately lost my family even though they were probably feet away from me I couldn't see them. I didn't know that I was injured. I remember feeling like half of my right foot was gone. I remember trying to put pressure on it and I started to limp. I managed to limp over to a rail and I grabbed onto the rail and passed out for maybe a minute,” she said. “Next thing I know I'm lying flat on my back and there are these men putting mass amounts of pressure on my thigh. They're tying tourniquets to my thigh. I can remember putting his forehead to mine and telling me that I was going to be okay.”

“I was getting increasingly cold and I knew I was dying and I remember having moments of panic and seeing carnage and blood on the street. I had no idea what had happened I just knew it was bad. I remember thinking how can this be real, everything was so happy a few moments ago,” she said.

Another witness for the prosecution, Rebecca Gregory, a tourist from Houston, was celebrating her birthday in Boston with son Noah, 5 on the day of the race. She and her son were cheering on family member near finish line when the first bomb went off.

“I looked down and I couldn’t see my legs. My bones were literally on the sidewalk next to me. I thought that was that day I would die,"" she told the court.

So far, the defense has declined to cross examine the government’s witnesses.

Tamerlan Tsarnaev's Widow Under Investigation

While prosecutors focus today on Dzhokhar, authorities told ABC News they’re also investigating whether Tamerlan’s wife, Katherine Russell, knew of the deadly plot beforehand.

Russell is suspected of being the woman who accompanied Tsarnaev to a Macy’s in Boston two months before the April 2013 attack where he bought five pressure cookers – two of which were allegedly used to make the bombs placed at the marathon finish line. In an affidavit to search the Tsarnaev’s home, FBI agents said they were looking for clothing consistent with those seen on a security video at Macy’s.

Lawyers for Russell and federal prosecutors initially declined to answer ABC News questions about Russell’s status, but a senior law enforcement official said she could face charges of misprision of a felony, or failing to notify authorities of a crime about to happen.

Following Tuesday’s ABC News report on Russell, an attorney for Russell, Joshua Dratel, said in a written statement to ABC News, “There is no video of Ms. Russell at a Macy’s in connection with the purchase of pressure cookers, and any claim that there is such a video, or any claim remotely approaching that, is false. Also false is any allegation that Ms. Russell was involved in the purchase of any pressure cookers, or that she accompanied her late husband with respect to any such purchase by him.”

Days after Tamerlan was identified as one of the suspected bombers, another of Russell’s attorneys at the time, released a statement saying Russell was assisting the investigation into the bombing and was not aware of the plot beforehand.

“As a mother, a sister, a daughter, a wife, Katie deeply mourns the pain and loss to innocent victims, students, law enforcement officers, families and our community,” the attorney, Miriam Weizenbaum, said then.

[This report was updated March 5, 2015 to include a statement from an attorney for Russell.]

The toddler, Owen Wright, was playing in a park in Sprague, Washington, on Sunday with his older brother, 10-year-old Brenden, and sister, 8-year-old Delicia. The siblings were playing unsupervised in a park next to their babysitter’s home while their father, Michael Wright, was at work, according to local ABC affiliate KXLY.

Surveillance footage from a nearby grocery store shows the suspect running off with Owen in his arms.

As the suspect fled with Owen, the toddler’s siblings began chasing after him.

""This little girl come running around the corner screaming her head off,” witness Dorothy Giddings told KXLY.

Delicia’s screams alerted passersby, including two teenage boys who joined the pursuit.

“I didn’t really care. There was a kid’s life in danger,” said one of the teens, Andrew Crane.

“I don’t consider myself a hero. I consider myself a person doing the right thing,” said another, Isaac Yow.

The suspect eventually abandoned Owen in an empty lot before continuing to flee.

“I told that little girl, I said, 'Honey, you did exactly what you needed to do scream your head off,’” Giddings said of Owen’s sister. “That's what saved that baby. Her screaming and us running.”

The suspect in the alleged kidnapping remains at large. Police in the small community of Sprague, population 500, are asking anyone who recognizes the suspect to contact the Lincoln County Sheriff's Office at 509-725-3501.

The siblings’ father, Michael Wright, says he “can’t explain” what happened after hearing his son had been kidnapped.

“I can't explain the feeling, the anxiety and everything that goes into finding out your children is missing or something has happened to them,"" Wright told KXLY."

The story of Ella Schultz, 6, made headlines after her Make-A-Wish request -- a backyard playhouse -- was rejected by a local homeowner association, according to local news station KCTV 5 News in Kansas City.

Originally, the team at the Make-a-Wish foundation managed to get construction company JE Dunn to donate time and materials, according to a spokeswoman for JE Dunn.

But the plan hit a snag when the Stone Homeowner's Association initially said the playhouse violated certain neighborhood rules, according to an emailed statement.

For the past few days, Ella has been treated for her cancer at the University of Kansas hospital.

A new statement from the Stone Homeowner's Association suggested the girl might be able to arrive home to find a new playhouse in the yard.

The homeowner's association told ABC News the initial request was not accepted because the board needed more information to grant an exception to the neighborhood rules. The association added in its statement to ABC News that it will try to work with the Make-A-Wish Foundation and the JE Dunn construction company to figure out a way to give Ella her very own playhouse.

""Our hearts are with Ella Schultz and her family as they battle this terrible illness,"" read a portion of the statement. ""In hopes of getting enough information, we are requesting an immediate meeting with Make-A-Wish and J.E. Dunn Construction to work out a solution in the most expeditious manner possible.""

If the plans are approved, both the Make-A-Wish Foundation and the JE Dunn construction company said they'd be happy to get the playhouse built for Ella.

""Our desire, as it is with every child we serve, is to grant their one, true wish,"" read a statement from the Make-A-Wish Foundation. ""However, we have a responsibility to follow local regulations, ordinances and laws within the communities we serve. We hope to see a resolution to this issue soon and we remain committed to granting Ella’s heartfelt wish.""

Ella’s parents were evaluating multiple requests for comment and have not yet responded to ABC News’ request, according to a spokeswoman for the University of Kansas Hospital."

Delta Flight 1086, an MD-88 arriving from Atlanta, skidded off Runway 13 around 11:05 a.m., according to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.

The Port Authority confirmed that all 127 passengers and five crew members, ""were safely taken off plane.""

At least 28 passengers had non-life threatening injuries, of those injured five people were transported to hospitals, according to the Fire Department of New York.

The runway where the plane landed had been plowed just minutes before and two other pilots reported ""good braking action"" as they landed, according to Port Authority Executive Director Pat Foye.

Once the plane landed, it veered sharply left about 4,500 to 5,000 feet down the 7,000-foot runway, skidding off to the side and nearly ending up in the water, according to Foye.

An Instagram video shot shortly after the crash showed a man at the scene leaving in a stretcher.

LaGuardia's runways were closed for most of the day, but one runway reopened at 2 p.m., according to Foye.

Officials said they were checking for a fuel leak.

The National Transportation Safety Board announced it would send an investigator to secure the flight data recorders and document the damage.

Images of the plane taken by eyewitnesses showed that it apparently crashed through a fence after skidding off the runway.

""Customers deplaned via aircraft slides and have moved to the terminal on buses,"" Delta Airlines said in a statement. ""Our priority is ensuring our customers and crew members are safe. Delta will work with all authorities and stakeholders to look into what happened in this incident.""

Passengers on the plane included New York Giants tight end Larry Donnell, who said he was ""safe and sound"" after the crash.

""I feel fine physically and hopefully all the other passengers did not have any significant injuries,"" read a portion of Donnell's statement. ""We were all shocked and alarmed when the plane started to skid, but most importantly, as far as I know, all of the passengers and flight crew were able to exit the plane safely.""

An incredible photo was captured by passenger Jared Falleci from inside the plane just after it came to a stop. Falleci told ABC News he had no idea if the plane would stay out of the water as they skidded off the runway.

""I was holding on to the seat in front of me and I was praying,"" he told ABC News. ""It literally stopped a matter of feet, as you can see from the photos, from the water itself."""

At a news conference, the attorneys for the Brown family confirmed that the city of Ferguson and former police officer, Darren Wilson, would be named in the suit. They did not say when exactly the suit would be filed.

Brown was fatally shot by Wilson last August, sparking numerous protests in Ferguson.

""We believe that there were other alternatives available to him,"" Daryl Parks, attorney of Michael Brown's family, said of Wilson. ""He did not have to kill Michael Brown.""

The news comes a day after the Department of Justice announced they would not be prosecuting Wilson for Brown's death.

Attorney Anthony Gray, speaking on behalf of Brown's family, said they ""disagree with those findings.""

Michael Brown's parents, Lesley McSpadden and Michael Brown Sr. attended the news conference but did not speak to reporters.

Also this week, the Department of Justice also released a scathing report that found the Ferguson Police Department had a pattern and practice of discriminatory policing."

Speaking to reporters in Seattle, Knox said she was still processing the court's decision.

""I just wanted to say that I am incredibly grateful for what has happened, for the justice I've received, for the support that I've had from everyone,"" she said. ""What comes to mind is my gratitude for that life that has been given to me.""

Knox, 27, was initially convicted by an Italian court of killing British student Meredith Kercher in 2007, but that decision was overturned on appeal in October 2011 after she had spent four years in prison.

She was then reconvicted last year and an appeal of the reconviction began this month. There is no possibility of any further appeals after Froday’s ruling.

""Meredith was my friend and she deserved so much in this life,"" Knox told reporters.

Knox's lawyer Carlo Dalla Vedova was her representative in court, saying that Friday's decision was the ""best thing that could happen."" Prior to the verdict, he told ABC News that the reconviction was ""a big mistake that has to be rectified.""

Knox previously told ABC News that she would not be traveling to Italy for the new appeal because if found guilty, she would then be sent back to prison for up to 28 years.

""I did not expect this to happen,"" Knox told ABC News in January 2014. ""I really expected so much better from the Italian justice system. They found me innocent once before.""

Knox has rebuilt her life in her hometown of Seattle, writing freelance theater reviews for a local paper and working at a bookstore. In February, her family said that she was engaged to Colin Sutherland, a friend whom she has known since middle school.

Her ex-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito faced the same appeal and was also annulled. While he has been present in the Rome court throughout the week, Knox has remained in America.

""I will never go willingly back,"" she said in January 2014."

Late Tuesday car manufacturer Toyota was ordered to pay $11 million to the victims of a 2006 car crash that claimed the lives of three people and to Koua Fong Lee, the driver of one vehicle who was imprisoned for more than two years.

Lee was featured in an ABC News investigation into “sudden acceleration,” a phenomenon in which Toyota drivers said their vehicle could randomly take off on its own and could not be stopped. Ever since the deadly 2006 accident, Lee had maintained that his 1996 Toyota Camry was defective and that it wasn't his fault the car rammed into an Oldsmobile, killing three people, including two children.

Late Tuesday, in a new suit against Toyota, a jury in Minneapolis found that the car maker was mostly – 60 percent – to blame for the 2006 accident because Lee’s Camry was defective, though the jury said Lee was still 40 percent at fault, according to The Associated Press.

“No amount of money… will bring my life back. My life is not the same anymore,” Lee said after the verdict, the AP reported. “I tried everything I could to stop my car.”

Of the $10.94 million Toyota has reportedly been ordered to pay, Lee is expected to receive $750,000.

In a statement provided to ABC News, Toyota said the company respects the jury’s decision, but believes ""the evidence clearly demonstrated that Mr. Lee's 1996 Camry was not the cause of this unfortunate accident."" The company said it would consider its legal options.

Ford, 72, was forced to make an emergency landing at Penmar Golf Course, just west of Santa Monica Municipal Airport, at 2:20 p.m. PST Thursday after the engine of the Ryan ST3KR plane he was flying failed, said NTSB and Los Angeles fire officials. He was taken to a nearby hospital in ""fair to moderate"" condition, said Patrick Butler with the Los Angeles Fire Department.

Ford reported engine trouble shortly after taking off from Santa Monica Municipal Airport and asked for an immediate return to the airport, said NTSB investigator Patrick Jones. He then reported that his aircraft came up short of the runway, according to air traffic controller transmissions from LiveATC.net.

The vintage airplane that Ford was piloting clipped a tree before crashing, said Jones.

Elaine Miller told ABC station KABC that the pilot was able to speak and ""expressed that he was in pain."" She and several others helped him out of the plane after it crashed.

""He had a significant head wound,"" said Miller. ""He asked someone to hold his legs up, and people were just saying, 'you’re okay, the fire department is on its way,' and...once police and fire started to arrive, my friends and I sort of backed away and went to the other side of the course to give them room.""

Carlos Gomez, who lives across the street from the golf course, described the plane crash as sounding like a boom.

""I hear a lot of ambulances and I come outside and see people from the golf course pull a man from the plane,"" he said. ""He was moving his arms and legs. I was happy he was alive and not paralyzed.""

Mark Hamill, who is appearing alongside Ford in ""Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,"" poked fun at his co-star's plane crash.

Glad to hear Harrison is doing well. Get well soon. May all his future flights be green-screen!

Ford's son tweeted that his father was ""battered, but ok!""

At the hospital. Dad is ok. Battered, but ok! He is every bit the man you would think he is. He is an incredibly strong man.

Thank you all for your thoughts and good vibes for my dad.

The NTSB will recover the airplane Friday, said Jones.

An avid pilot, Ford told ABC's Barbara Walters in 2008 that he ""loved the freedom of flight.""

""I love the places you go,"" he said. ""I love the people in aviation, the people that I meet in aviation. I love seeing the world from an airplane. I'm in love with flying.""

Ford survived a crash once before. He and a flight instructor crashed a helicopter near Van Nuys Airport in California in 1999, according to The Los Angeles Times.

Ford has worked to support general aviation with the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, and he presented a legacy award in his name to the president of the association in January.

Ford broke his leg on the set of ""Star Wars: Episode VII"" in June 2014 after a door crashed down on it. He had successful surgery following the incident.

Star Wars is produced by Lucasfilm, which is owned by The Walt Disney Co., which also owns ABC News.

The call about Flight 1651 came in around 12:10 p.m. and the plane landed safely at McCarran International Airport around 12:25 p.m., officials told ABC affiliate KTNV.

The cockpit door malfunctioned, locking the pilot out of the cockpit, airport officials told KTNV, noting that the first officer made the landing.

""About half way through [the 2.5-hour flight] there seemed to be some talking at the front of the plane. You could see the captain out there,"" passenger Jesse Dougherty told ABC News. ""There wasn't a huge panic but some confusion.""

The captain explained to the passengers that the door was jammed and he couldn't get back in, Dougherty said, adding: ""It was very, very bizarre.""

When the first officer made the landing ""perfectly,"" the passengers broke out into spontaneous applause, Dougherty said.

Because the first officer was accustomed to the controls on the right seat of the cockpit, he remained there, the crew explained to passengers. That meant the only issue was a lack of taxiing controls once on the ground, necessitating a tow from the runway to the gate, Dougherty said.

No one was injured and there were 168 people on board the plane, officials said.

The source of the jammed door was a piece of string that was found near the door by the maintenance crew, passenger Jonathan Thalacker told ABC News.

The aircraft was an MD-90, airport spokeswoman Christine Crews told ABC News.

""There was a door malfunctioned that locked the captain out so the first officer had to do an unassisted landing,"" Crews said. ""We take everything very seriously. This was an unusual landing. He called the airport so that we would have ground response available."""

The $85,000 diamond was finally returned Wednesday to Old Northeast Jewelers in Tampa, Florida, after it was stolen in the fall of 2013.

Owner Jeffrey Hess said a notably well-groomed group of thieves was able to distract his sales staff and get away with the 6.04-carat diamond.

“We were all really upset,” Hess told ABC News. “My wife said, ‘I think the diamond is going to come back to us.’ I said, ‘No way.’”

Because of their store’s security camera system, Hess said police were able to identify who the thieves were, but tracking down the diamond would be more difficult. Still, Hess said he tried to find the rare gem.

“We kept an eye out on social media and online websites, auction sites, diamond listing sites, looking for a 6.04,” Hess said.

Eight months after the theft, Hess said he found a diamond that he thought might be the same one stolen from his store for sale on a popular diamond-selling website. Hess said he told police, who were able to quickly determine what happened.

“It was sold to someone in Florida, and they sold it to someone on 47th street [in New York]. And then it was send to a lab in Israel,” Hess said.

Before the diamond had been stolen, Hess said the Gemological Institute of America (GIA) had done a plot of the diamond’s internal characteristics. When police recovered the diamond in New York, Hess said it was then sent to the GIA, which confirmed it was, indeed, the same stolen diamond.

“We had been able to discern pretty quickly that it was our diamond, because it had the proper crown angles, proper measurements,” Hess said.

Seven months later, the diamond was finally returned to their store in St. Petersburg, Florida, where it is available for sale. The store has now doubled up its security camera system, and the staff has had intensive training to prevent such a theft from happening again.

Hess said New York police know who the thieves are and have issued a warrant for their arrest.

“It’s a note to jewelers out there that sometimes you have to take the bull by the horns and do your own investigative work,” Hess said.

And when the diamond was finally in his possession, Hess said his wife told him, “’I told you that it would come back.’”"

Journalist and reality star Katie Hopkins, known as ""the most hated woman in Britain,"" blasted Clarkson's size on Twitter.

""What happened to Kelly Clarkson?"" Hopkins wrote on Feb. 20. ""Did she eat all of her backing singers? Happily I have wide-screen.""

She went on: ""Darling, if you had a baby a year ago, that is not baby weight. It is fat. Quit calling it cute names to make yourself feel better.""

Hopkins, who gained her reputation as the villain on ""The Apprentice UK,"" didn't leave it there. In an interview with ""Entertainment Tonight"" on Wednesday, she said, ""Kelly Clarkson is now a chunky monkey, if we’re putting it kindly. She does look like she’s eaten her backup singers. My advice: she needs to get out there with her stroller and do some pushing and get some of that weight off.""

Clarkson, who gave birth to daughter River Rose last June, was unfazed -- even puzzled -- by the fat-shaming comments when first asked about them by Heat magazine.

""I don't have a clue what you're talking about,"" she told the magazine. ""Someone tweeted something about me?""

After the reporter explained who Hopkins is and what she'd said, Clarkson laughed.

""Oh, and she's tweeted something nasty about me? That's because she doesn't know me,"" she said. ""I'm awesome! It doesn't bother me. It's a free world. Say what you will.""

Added Clarkson, ""I've just never cared what people think. It's more if I'm happy and I'm confident and feeling good. That's always been my thing. And more so now, since having a family -- I don't seek out any other acceptance."""

They've known each other for more than a decade, but only learned of their mutual organ donor after their families bumped into each other in the waiting room at Spectrum Health System in Grand Rapids Michigan during their transplants.

""Fred's heart and my lungs spent 32 years in the same body, powering the person that owned them."" said Veldman, 67. ""And now, they're on separate missions in separate bodies. When we get together, we can bring them together to be close one more time. It may sound hokey, but to us, it's a very emotional thing.""

Veldman was diagnosed with a genetic disease in 2007 that by February 2014 had reduced his lungs to 15 percent capacity. He said he was gaunt, blue and couldn't walk more than 15 feet. Soon, he was listed for a lung transplant.

""When I would be talking to my friends before surgery, I could see in their eyes that they thought this was going to be the end of me talking with them,"" he said. ""They knew there wasn't any time left for me.""

Nelis, 60, was diagnosed with an idiopathic cardiomyopathy, a progressive heart disease that caused his heart to become enlarged, when he was 39. He was healthy enough to stay active and out of the hospital for nearly two more decades, but developed an irregular heartbeat a few years ago, sending him into declining health. After getting a blood clot in his left ventricular assist device and battling an abdominal infection, he was listed for a heart transplant in 2014.

But on June 18, they both got the call: doctors had found a match.

Soon after his lung transplant, Veldman's lungs were working at 96 percent capacity, he said. When he called to tell people the good news back home, they almost didn't recognize his voice. One friend -- Nelis' brother-in-law -- told Veldman he already knew about his lung transplant because he was in the waiting room for Nelis' heart transplant.

""That's our our saga of organ brothers started,"" Nelis said.

Now, Nelis and Veldman meet regularly because they share a special bond, Nelis said.

""We compare progress and bemoan ... how many medications we're on,"" Nelis said with a laugh.

They hope one day to meet their donor's family to say thank you. They say they're now among those who owe their lives to people who said ""yes"" to being organ donors.

There are currently 123,296 people on the organ transplant waiting list nationwide, according to the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network. An average of 21 people die each day waiting for transplants, according to the organization."

Hunter Cmelo and his family have a new minivan thanks to the local businesses in Medford, Oregon, and Grants Pass, Oregon, and a local radio host who heard his story.

The 6-year-old arrived late to Lincoln Elementary School last week because his family was having car trouble.

“[The school has] a policy where every three tardies, you get a detention,” Hunter’s mother, Nicole Garloff, 25, of Grants Pass, told ABC News. “Every tardy after that, you get a detention.”

Garloff said they knew Hunter would be getting a detention that day and that he was crying when he went in that morning. But she was shocked when she visited him at lunch that day and learned what his detention was actually like.

“He was at the first table as you walk into the cafeteria, and he was just sitting there with one of those cardboard poster partitions in front of him ... and two or three books next to him,” Garloff said.

She said the school policy was to have students make up work they missed because they were late. Since Hunter was only late by a few minutes, he didn’t have work to make up, so he was told to read a book.

“I was really upset. I went and got my iPad and took a picture of him,” said Garloff. “He wasn’t tardy so many times that he deserved that.

After Garloff posted the photo on her Facebook, the image of her son sitting alone at lunch went viral, coming to the attention of AM 1440 radio personality Bill Meyer. Meyer first heard about the story through his listeners and social media.

“We see a lot of bad news, or we have a lot of problems. So seldomly do we ever get a chance to fix the root of the problem,” Meyer told ABC News. “I saw the school policy as being unjust, but I saw the root of the trouble was car trouble.”

So Meyer reached out to Lisa McClease-Kelly, who owns Kelly’s Automotive, which is located in Medford and in Grants Pass, to see if she would be willing to repair the family’s Dodge Durango.

“The repairs were more than what the car was actually worth,” McClease-Kelly told ABC News. Luckily, a local company, Rapid Repo and Collections, offered to donate a 2001 Chrysler Town and Country van to the family.

Other local businesses pitched in to install a new windshield in the van, two new tires, and McClease-Kelly put about $1,400 of maintenance into it. Hunter’s family was surprised when they came to the shop this week.

“We thought we were going there to be told that our Durango was not going to be fixable at all,” Garloff said. “We were so shocked, it doesn’t seem real. I’m trying to tell Hunter that this doesn’t just happen to you.”

McClease-Kelly will give the family free oil changes for a year, and many others who heard their story donated to give the family a gas card, as well as gift cards to local restaurants.

“This family never asked for the help. All they ever wanted was to change the school policy,” Meyer said. “We saw a way to do a little nudge, and then everyone else came in with their time and generosity.”

The school policy has since been amended, according to the Grants Pass District Superintendent’s office.

“As a result of the concerns raised, the district ended the learning catch-up location at Lincoln Elementary School,” the Grants Pass District said in a statement. “Going forward, a separate, supervised classroom has been designated for necessary catch-up work.”

Garloff said Hunter hasn’t been late since the family got the van and that she is waiting to see if the school’s policy will change.

“We’re so thankful to all the people in our community that have just been so supportive,” Garloff said."
1BWX3WK,2015-03-08 00:00:00,Daylight Saving Time 2015: Tips for Springing Forward - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Health/daylight-saving-time-2015-tips-springing-forward/story?id=29424357,"Daylight saving time 2015 will begin on Sunday, March 8 at 2:00 a.m. That means it's time to spring forward, but the sweet act of moving the clocks an hour ahead can deliver a blow to your sleeping schedule

For most, daylight saving time is an exciting sign of spring that comes with a slightly sleepy Monday. But if you're not a morning person to begin with, your mood and productivity can take a dive. Daylight saving time has been blamed for car accidents, workplace injuries and stock market dips in the past.

That's because people are experiencing more than just jet lag this time of year. They're dealing with a new light-dark cycle.

""It's an interesting paradox, because traveling one time zone east or west is very easy for anyone to adapt to,"" said Dr. Alfred Lewy, director of Oregon Health and Science University's Sleep and Mood Disorders Laboratory in Portland, Oregon. ""But in daylight saving time, the new light-dark cycle is perversely working against the body clock. We're getting less sunlight in morning and more in the evening.""

The body clock is a cluster of neurons deep inside the brain that generates the circadian rhythm, also known as the sleep-wake cycle. The cycle spans roughly 24 hours, but it's not precise.

""It needs a signal every day to reset it,"" said Lewy.

The signal is sunlight, which shines in through the eyes and ""corrects the cycle from approximately 24 hours to precisely 24 hours,"" said Lewy. But when the sleep-wake and light-dark cycles don't line up, people can feel out-of-sync, tired and downright grumpy.

With time, the body clock adjusts on its own. But here are a few ways to help it along.

Getting some early morning sun Saturday and Sunday can help the brain's sleep-wake cycle line up with the new light-dark cycle. But it means getting up and outside at dawn. Sleeping by a window won't cut it, Lewy said. The sunlight needs to be direct because glass filters out much of the frequencies involved in re-setting the sleep-wake cycle.

Resisting the urge to linger in the late sunlight Sunday and Monday also can help the body clock adjust, Lewy said.

While light synchronizes the body clock in the morning, the hormone melatonin updates it at night.

The exact function of the hormone, produced by the pea-size pineal gland in the middle of the brain, is unclear. But it can activate melatonin receptors on the neurons of the body clock, acting as a ""chemical signal for darkness,"" Lewy said.

Taking a low-dose (less than 0.3 milligrams) of melatonin late in the afternoon Friday through Monday can help sync the sleep-wake and light-dark cycles. But be careful: Though melatonin is sold as a dietary supplement, it can cause drowsiness and interfere with other drugs.

1BxFIAq,2015-03-11 00:00:00,New Bionic Heart Doesn't Beat and That's Why It Could Revolutionize Transplants - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Health/bionic-heart-beat-revolutionize-transplants/story?id=29561751,"Scientists at the Texas Heart Institute say the perfect bionic heart is within their reach, but it doesn't beat.

The average human heart has to beat 42 million times a year, which means that if it were replaced with a machine with a lot of moving parts, it would quickly wear out, said Dr. William Cohn, chief medical officer of BiVACOR, the company working on the new bionic heart.

Instead, BiVACOR, headquartered in Houston at the Texas Heart Institute, is developing the first device of its kind to have only one moving part, which propels blood through the body instead of pumping it.

When Australian researcher Daniel Timms came to him three years ago looking for a new home for his project, Cohn said he knew it was something special, even though Timms didn't have a working prototype at the time. Researchers around the world had been working on the project for Timms without pay, and they all relocated to Houston, Cohn noted.

Now, the BiVACOR team has developed a working prototype and put it into large animals, he said. They're able to walk on a treadmill and live for a month before the team culls them to examine the heart's effect on their liver, brain and other organs.

""Kidney function, lung function, everything works beautifully throughout,"" Cohn said.

The heart is about half the size of a soda can, Cohn said. It has a spinning disk with fins suspended by two magnetic fields so that it's never touching anything.

There are 4,060 people currently awaiting heart transplants in the United States and 39 more awaiting heart-lung transplants, according to the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network. Overall, there are 123,289 people waiting for organs in the United states, and an average of 21 people die each day waiting for transplant."
1BxFmJO,2015-01-28 00:00:00,Jordan: ISIS Hasn't Given Proof of Life for Hostage Pilot - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/International/jordan-isis-hasnt-proof-life-hostage-pilot/story?id=28547391,"In a new message uploaded online today, a Japanese hostage of the terror group ISIS purportedly arranges a prisoner swap in which he would go free in exchange for a convicted terrorist held by Jordan -– or a Jordanian pilot held by ISIS will be killed.

In an audio recording, allegedly made by captive Japanese journalist Kenji Goto, Goto says that if al Qaeda convict Sajida al-Rishawi “is not ready for exchange for my life at the Turkish border by Thursday sunset” then Jordanian pilot Lt. Muath al-Kaseasbeh “will be killed immediately.” The recording refers to sunset in Mosul, Iraq, meaning mid-morning east coast time.

Earlier today Jordan’s government said it would go through with a prisoner swap with the terror group ISIS in order to get its captured pilot back, but a top official of the Middle Eastern nation says the government has not received proof that he’s still alive. Goto’s message did not say the Jordanian pilot would be freed in the newly-proposed arrangement.

Foreign Minister Nasser Judeh posted a message on Twitter saying the government asked for, but has not received, “evidence of health and safety of the hero, Muath.” Al-Kaseasbeh was captured by ISIS last December after his aircraft was shot down.

Al-Rishawi, an Iraqi woman, has been on death row in Jordan since she confessed to her role as a would-be suicide bomber in a string of al Qaeda attacks in Jordan in 2005 that killed dozens.

Prior to reports of Jordan’s willingness to accept the trade, Middle East expert Jon Alterman told ABC News that by asking for, and potentially gaining al-Rishawi’s release, ISIS is attempting to bolster its long-held goal of being seen as a proper nation-state on a geopolitical scale.

“What it represents is ISIS again trying to act like a real country. It’s a small group of outlaws trying to engage in governments,” Alterman, head of the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said Tuesday.

ISIS, the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, has publicly beheaded dozens of captives, including a handful of Western journalists and aid workers, sometimes after making demands of their governments.

The Japanese hostage Goto was not mentioned in statements made by Jordanian officials about a potential deal today, despite reports that Japanese officials have been working closely with Jordan to find ways to free both hostages.

“Please save Kenji’s life,” Goto’s mother said in her own video, released Tuesday. “Kenji has only a little time left.”"

Because the petition exceeded 100,000 signatures within 30 days, the White House is required to respond.

The creator of this petition, known only by the initials C.H., alleges that the 47 senators “committed a treasonous offense when they decided to violate the Logan Act, a 1799 law which forbids unauthorized citizens from negotiating with foreign governments.”

The letter, which was published on Monday, warned Iranian leaders that any nuclear deal they sign with President Obama won’t last past his second term.

Jerome Barron, a professor of Constitutional Law at George Washington University, told ABC News in an interview that he finds the senators’ letter “disrespectful,” but he does not believe the senators have committed treason.

“They would make the argument the Logan Act doesn’t apply because they are one of the three branches of government and although the they don’t have the major role of foreign relations, they do, after all, as the senate, confirm treaties,” Barron said. “It’s true this is an executive agreement, but they [the Senate] have some role I suppose. I don’t think they’re in violation of the Logan Act.”

When asked about the potential violation of the Logan Act, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest highlighted the authority of the Department of Justice.

“For a determination like that, I'd refer you to the Department of Justice. It ultimately would be their responsibility to make that kind of determination,” Earnest said today in the White House briefing room. “I know that there's been a lot of speculation about this, but I'm not aware of any conversations about the Logan Act in its relation to this specific matter that have taken place here at the White House.”

And while Earnest redirected the inquiry about the potential Logan Act violation for now, the White House will have to make an official response to the petition.

Other petitions that have met the White House’s response threshold include legalizing marijuana, publishing the White House beer recipe and even deporting Justin Bieber back to Canada.

Prosecutors say Collier, 27, was shot in the head by either defendant Dzhokhar Tsarnaev or his late brother Tamerlan hours after the FBI published images of the brothers and asked for public help in tracking the bomb suspects down. Investigators believe the brothers were trying to steal Collier’s gun, and even though they killed him, they were ultimately unsuccessful.

One video, apparently shot from across the street, showed the brothers coming around the courtyard to Collier’s cruiser before killing.

Two other images shot from above and obtained by ABC News prior to the hearing today showed the horrific aftermath, with police cars surrounding the crime scene, apparently Collier’s blood staining the ground.

“As soon as they reach the car, they open the door,” Weinreb said, and then a man opened fire, “shooting him in the head at point-blank range twice in the side of the head and once right between the eyes.”

Weinreb said the figures in the video were too small to determine who the assassin was. ""The video didn’t reveal whether the defendant pulled the trigger, or whether the both did, but it doesn’t matter. They both murdered him,” he said.

Tsarnaev’s defense said Tamerlan was the one who pulled the trigger.

In addition, Weinreb said, the Ruger P95 9-millimeter gun that was used to kill Collier came from Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, then 19.

A few months before the bombing, Weinreb said, Tsarnaev told a friend “that he needed a gun.” That gun came from Tsarnaev’s high school classmate, Stephen Silva, 21, who pleaded guilty in December to heroin dealing and charges connected to that gun.

Silva will testify as a government witness against Tsarnaev, prosecutors said. During an unrelated arrest in Nov. 2013 Silva told police that he “smoked a lot of weed because his best friend was the bomber.”
After Collier was dead, Weinreb said, the brothers “tried to steal his gun from his holster.” A lock on his holster prevented that theft, he said.

The Tsarnaev brothers went on to commit more bloodshed that night, prosecutors say, carjacking a man and then using his vehicle to flee to a street corner in Watertown where a gun and bomb battle ensued."
1ByfQEp,2015-03-11 00:00:00,In Search of the Great American Beard - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/search-great-american-beard/story?id=29556695,"They are going in search of ""the great American beard.""

Photographer Mr Elbank and charity campaigner Jimmy Niggles have already photographed and featured some of the most impressive beards in the world. Now, after the success of their ""Beard"" exhibition at London’s historic Somerset House this month, they plan to tackle the American continent in pursuit of the world’s ultimate facial hair.

The pair hopes to photograph famous beards, like those belonging to Jeff Bridges, Leonardo Di Caprio, Zach Galifianakis and Brad Pitt. The Hollywood stars would add to an already impressive collection of beard photography from around the world, marking the return of the beard into mainstream popular culture.

""We thought we needed to seize the moment before beards reach their peak, in terms of fashionability,"" said exhibition curator Stephen Doherty, from Somerset House.

In recent years, beards have been making a steady comeback, coinciding with the rise of the hipster. From Brooklyn, New York, to the East End of London, beards are now in.

By 2013, some style watchers suggested that contemporary culture had already reached ""peak-beard,"" but the trend does seem to be displaying determined longevity.

“I think there's a reaction against the trend for metrosexuality,"" Doherty said. ""Men are reclaiming their facial hair in an attempt to stamp a bit of their own masculinity back on things.""

What’s clear from the 80 images on display as part of the ""Beard"" exhibition is that beards are no longer just the domain of lumberjacks and old men. There are young men, fashion-conscious hipsters, men of faith, businessmen, fishermen, a cross-dresser and even a woman.

""Beards can make an ordinary-looking person look more attractive,"" Doherty said.

The face of the exhibition is Jimmy Niggles and his self-described “very thick, rich mahogany, very natural, full beard."" Niggles is a charity campaigner and social media ""Beard Idol,"" who first grew a beard following the death of his close friend from skin cancer.

""We use it as a conversation starter to encourage people to get a skin check,"" Niggles said. ""And five years on we've started this thing called ""Beard Season,"" which has taken off around the world and we've now got hundreds of thousands of people growing beards every winter,"" he said.

To support this cause, Mr Elbank started up #Project60, photographing 60 people with beards to raise awareness for ""Beard Season."" The campaign has gained such global notoriety, Niggles said, ""every week we receive on average one or two emails from people saying they've met one of our beard ambassadors and had a skin check, which probably saved their life, which is a pretty great thing.""

The next stage of the follicle-finding journey for both Niggles and Mr Elbank is their quest to find ""the Great American Beard."" They hope to take their portraits to Los Angeles later this year."

1BZ8EBb,2015-02-09 00:00:00,ISIS Appears to Kill Jordanian Pilot in New Video - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/International/isis-appears-kill-jordanian-pilot-video/story?id=28690632,"A Jordanian pilot held by ISIS appears to be killed in a new video released by the terror group today.

The pilot, Lt. Muath al-Kasasbeh, is shown in an orange jumpsuit in an outdoor cell before he is set on fire.

The undated video of al-Kasasbeh’s apparent death comes just days after ISIS uploaded another video showing what appeared to be the decapitated head of a Japanese hostage, journalist Kenji Goto.

Last week the Jordanian government had offered to release an al Qaeda prisoner in exchange for al-Kasasbeh, but officials said ISIS failed to prove that the pilot was alive. In addition, while ISIS said then they would release Goto for the al Qaeda prisoner, they did not offer al-Kasasbeh’s freedom.

Amid conflicting information, U.S. intelligence did not know if the pilot was alive as of the weekend, a defense official told ABC News. Some intelligence pointed to al-Kasasbeh having been killed weeks before. He was not shown in the public communications between ISIS and the Jordanian government.

Jordanian officials believe al-Kasasbeh was killed back in Jan. 3, according to a statement from the Jordanian armed forces posted on Jordanian state television’s website. The statement did not explain how the military came to that conclusion.

Prior to his death in the video, al-Kasasbeh speaks to the camera, explaining that he was captured by ISIS after his plane was hit during an anti-ISIS operation in December.

“My aircraft took a hit, [another officer] let me know there was fire coming out of my plane. I checked my signals and realized my engine was no longer functioning. I ejected myself. I fell into the river and was taken prisoner by the ISIS fighters,” he says.

In the last months ISIS has released a string of disturbing videos in which hostages, including several Western civilians, are decapitated, but death by fire appears to be a new tactic.

King Abdullah of Jordan said that the ""courageous pilot died defending his faith, his country"" and called for Jordanians to ""show the mettle of the Jordanian people in facing the challenges that will only make us stronger and more united.""

A spokesperson for the White House National Security Council said the U.S. intelligence community is aware of the video and is ""working to confirm its authenticity.""

""The United States strongly condemns [ISIS's] actions and we call for the immediate release of all those held captive by [ISIS],"" spokesperson Bernadette Meehan said. ""We stand in solidarity with the Government of Jordan and the Jordanian people.""

ISIS is believed to be holding a number of hostages, including a 26-year-old American woman.

Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) told ABC News the video was “just another manifestation of the evil that we’re facing and the administration has done nothing.”

“They are not losing. ISIS is not losing. I promise you,” he said.

President Obama told reporters shortly after the video's release that it will only make the coalition ""redouble"" its efforts against the terror group.

""I think we’ll redouble the vigilance and determination on the part of our global coalition to make sure they’re degraded and ultimately defeated,"" he said. ""It also just indicates the degree to which whatever ideology they’re operating off of, it’s bankrupt.""

The artist who painted the official portrait of President Bill Clinton that hangs in the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C. has revealed a surprise -- the portrait “subtly” incorporated Monica Lewinsky.

Artist Nelson Shanks says that the shadow on the left side of the portrait was cast by a mannequin in a blue dress -- a nod to the president’s affair with his 22-year-old intern.

“The blue dress itself doesn't appear in the painting,” Shanks told ABC News. “Only the shadow, which is symbolic of a shadow across the administration.”

Shanks, who described Clinton to the Philadelphia Daily News as “probably the most famous liar of all time,” says the former president never saw the shadow when he posed for the portrait in the Oval Office.

Shanks added the shadow in the painting later, in his Philadelphia studio.

“It was meant to be subtle and I think it is subtle,” he said. ""I mean, I am doing historical documents in a way.""

At the time of the portrait’s unveiling, Clinton thanked Shanks for the portrait, calling him a “great talent.”

The portrait is one of 55 Clinton portraits that are rotated at the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C.

The portrait is currently not on display, but it is in the museum’s gallery of collection.

A museum spokesperson told ABC News that they have not received any requests from the Clintons to remove the portrait.

The portrait originally stirred controversy when it was released in 2006 for the notable absence of a wedding ring on the President’s hand."

A statement issued Wednesday by the board said it was ""sincerely remorseful for the pain that this terrible chant has caused.""

""For the safety of the students that were involved and the students who were not involved, our desire would be for all parties to begin the healing process,"" read the statement. ""We hope that this despicable situation will forever change an atmosphere that would even allow an incident like this to take place.""

Video shows fraternity members chanting, “There will never be a n***** at SAE.” The chant also referred to lynchings and keeping African-Americans out of the fraternity.

Parker Rice, one of the students identified in the video, said in a statement to the Dallas Morning News, “the song was taught to us, but that too doesn’t work as an explanation.""

“I admit it likely was fueled by alcohol consumed at the house before the bus trip, but that’s not an excuse,” Rice, 19, said.

Former fraternity members have claimed the same language was used at other colleges, but the national headquarters denied being the source of the chant.

“In separate statements, the two men who have been expelled from the university have mentioned that the song was ‘taught to us,’” the fraternity said in a statement released late Tuesday. “However, as has been maintained in previous statements, the national fraternity does not teach such a racist, hateful chant, and this chant is not part of any education or training.

“Our investigation has found very likely that the men learned the song from fellow chapter members, which reiterates why Sigma Alpha Epsilon did not hesitate to close the chapter completely because of the culture that may have been fostered in the group.”

The fraternity was founded in 1856 at the University of Alabama and now features about 15,000 members across more than 200 chapters.

Another fraternity member, Levi Pettit, was also identified as a participant after the video appeared. His parents, Brody and Susan Pettit, released a statement Tuesday saying they were “shocked and saddened” by what they saw in the video.

""As parents of Levi, we love him and care for him deeply,"" they said. ""He made a horrible mistake, and will live with the consequences forever. However, we also know the depth of our son's character. He is a good boy, but what we saw in those videos is disgusting.”

University of Oklahoma President David Boren said the students who played a leadership role in the ""exclusionary"" chant had created a hostile learning environment. He said the chant was heard not only by those on a bus, but also affected the entire university community because it was distributed through social media.

According to a letter written by Boren, if the expelled students disagree with the decision, they can contact the school's Equal Opportunity Office by Friday.

The university has not confirmed the identities of the expelled students."

At Pizza Ranch in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, on Saturday, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush was peppered with questions on everything from GOP strategy to Alzheimer’s funding and flooding.

Bush, who said he envisioned a “hopeful and optimistic” campaign - if he decides to mount one - told potential supporters that Republicans must “get outside of our comfort zone.”

“Young people have had eight years of President Obama, and he turned them on, to begin with,” he added. “The thrill is gone.”

Bush also criticized the president’s stance on net neutrality. Last month, the FCC voted to reclassify Internet service providers as common carriers and impose regulations similar to those imposed on utilities.

The @FCC just voted to keep the internet open & free. That's the power of millions making their voices heard. Thank you! #NetNeutrality -bo

“The president steamrolled the FCC,” he said. “The idea of regulating access to the internet with a 1934 law is one of the craziest ideas I’ve ever heard.”

This weekend marks Bush’s first foray into Iowa politics since he last visited the Hawkeye State in October 2012. And in Iowa, retail politics are a potential candidates’ bread-and-butter – or, corn-and-pork.

“We are first in the nation, and we love it,” Joni Scotter, a Marion resident who is considered one of Iowa’s most highly-sought out volunteers, told ABC News. “If a candidate doesn’t get their noses right in front of our faces, oops, they’ve lost a vote. And I’m not kidding you, it’s a serious business.”

Scotter added that some of the volunteers are ""very snobby.""

“We’re used to having them come,” he said. “I’m not kidding you.”

Bush, who acknowledged that he needs to distance himself from his identity as “George’s boy or Barbara’s boy or W’s brother,” sought to re-brand himself.

“I’ve been on my own journey,” he said, touting his record as governor and his time in commercial real estate.

Though his surname has given some political pundits pause, many of the locals gathered at the Pizza Ranch to meet Bush were unconcerned – for them, his family’s political legacy is a point in his favor.

“I like the Bushes. The old man - I voted for him. I voted for George for the two terms he was in there,” said Ed Osbourn, a material handler in Cedar Rapids. “I’d probably vote for Jeb.”

“I think that he’s a strong candidate and I think he will be able to overcome any of the baggage with the name,” said Shelia Anderson, who owns a math learning center in Cedar Rapids.

The Pizza Ranch was so crowded that the proprietor was forced to ask unregistered guests to leave or risk shutting the event down.

But for those who were crowded out, never fear, Bush – who noted he has yet to make his 2016 decision – promised, “If I get beyond where we are today, I’ll be back here a lot.”"

More than 100 demonstrators gathered, along with media and police presence, but the tone was much different than a night before, when a large crowd gathered following the resignation of the St. Louis suburb's police chief. It was during that gathering that shots rang out and the two officers were injured.

The officers were released from the hospital Thursday morning after sustaining non-threatening injuries, the St. Louis County Police said in a Facebook post. St. Louis County Police and the Missouri State Highway Patrol have taken over security for the protests in Ferguson since the shooting.

The officers, who have not been identified, were ""lucky"" they weren't killed, St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said earlier Thursday. He said they heard ""hear three or four shots ring out"" before the officers were hurt, both of whom were seriously wounded from a shooter standing about 150 feet away.

""We are lucky by God's grace that we didn't lose two police officers,"" he said.

One officer, 41, was struck in the shoulder; the other, 32, in the face, Belmar said.

Belmar said the shots were fired from an undetermined location north or northwest of the Ferguson Police Department building.

The search for the suspect or suspects is the ""number one priority"" within the St. Louis County police department, according to Belmar.

President Obama called the shooting ""unacceptable.""

Violence against police is unacceptable. Our prayers are with the officers in MO. Path to justice is one all of us must travel together. –bo

U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, in a statement released this morning, said, ""This heinous assault on two brave law enforcement officers was inexcusable and repugnant. I condemn violence against any public safety officials in the strongest terms, and the Department of Justice will never accept any threats or violence directed at those who serve and protect our communities. ... Such senseless acts of violence threaten the very reforms that nonviolent protesters in Ferguson and around the country have been working towards for the past several months.""

Holder also said he wished the officers ""a full and speedy recovery.""

""We stand ready to offer any possible aid to an investigation into this incident, including the department's full range of investigative resources. And we will continue to stand unequivocally against all acts of violence against cops whenever and wherever they occur,"" he added.

Tensions simmered in the city on Wednesday night after the resignation of the city’s police chief, Tom Jackson. Hundreds of protesters gathered throughout the night, staring down police officers in riot gear.

A handful of people were arrested. Some people chanted, and other flare-ups were reported, unrest rekindled after a Justice Department report documented widespread racial bias in the city.

Jackson’s resignation makes him the sixth person who has been fired or forced to resign since the report was released March 4 detailing what it described as rampant racial bias in policing in the St. Louis suburb.

Lt. Col. Al Eickhoff will take over as the acting chief of police starting today as the city launches a national search for a new chief of police, the letter stated.

Jackson had initially come under fire in August for his department's handling of the shooting death of unarmed teenager Michael Brown.

Brown's parents released a statement today, calling the police shooting ""senseless.""

""We reject any kind of violence directed toward members of law enforcement. It cannot and will not be tolerated,"" the family said. ""We specifically denounce the actions of stand-alone agitators who unsuccessfully attempt to derail the otherwise peaceful and non-violent movement that has emerged throughout this nation to confront police brutality and to forward the cause of equality under the law for all. We must work together to bring peace to our communities. Our thoughts and prayers remain with the officers injured during this morning's shooting and their families.""

has posted their alleged personal details and called on sympathizers to take violent action against them.

U.S. officials say the military services are notifying the families of the individuals named on the list.

On Saturday, a previously unknown group identifying itself as the ""Islamic State Hacking Division"" posted on a website the names, photos and home addresses of 100 American service members it said were involved in the U.S. airstrike campaign against ISIS in Iraq and Syria.

It said it did so to enable lone wolf sympathizers to kill those named on the list.

U.S. officials said they were aware of the list and were looking into it.

""I can't confirm the validity of the information, but we are looking into it,"" a Defense Department spokesperson said. ""The safety of our service members is always a concern.""

A law enforcement official told ABC News that the FBI is aware of the post and ""monitoring"" the situation.

Defense officials said the military services were contacting the families of the individuals included on the list.

""The Air Force is cooperating fully with DOD on this matter,"" Air Force spokeswoman Lt. Col. Holly Slaughter said. ""The Air Force is taking the appropriate steps to make sure that everyone who needs to know is notified. As always, force protection is a primary concern.""

""Naval Criminal Investigative Service is looking into the matter for the Navy and is taking the appropriate steps to ensure that everyone is notified,"" said a defense official.

Marine Corps spokesman Lt. John Caldwell said NCIS is conducting in-person notifications to the Navy and Marine personnel regarding the currently unverified threat/data breach.

""It is recommended Marines and family members check their online/social footprint, ensuring privacy settings are adjusted to limit the amount of available personal information,"" Caldwell said. ""Vigilance and force protection considerations remain a priority for commanders and their personnel worldwide.""

The hacking group claimed it compiled the list from military records, but it appears the photos and information may have come from information available on social media sites or public records. Some of the names appeared in official Defense Department articles about the war on ISIS or other unrelated operations.

Over the past year the military services and regional commands have taken steps requesting its personnel be prudent and limit the amount of personal information posted on social media sites.

1C12HBc,2015-02-06 00:00:00,Former WWF Wrestler Jake 'The Snake' Roberts Story of Resurrection: I Wanted to Die - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wwf-wrestler-jake-snake-roberts-story-resurrection-wanted/story?id=28675399,"Note: This is Jake ""The Snake"" Roberts' story, as told to ABC News. In January, Roberts and close friend Diamond Dallas Page spoke about how the 59-year-old wrestling Hall of Famer was able to turn his life around, much of which is chronicled in a new documentary that recently debuted at the Slamdance Film Festival in Utah, ""The Resurrection of Jake The Snake Roberts."" This is their story, one that began almost three years ago when Page went to see Roberts at his home, to see if he could save his friend's life.

This story weaves back and forth between Roberts and Page from their point of view. Page is the founder of DDP Yoga, a fitness and diet program. His program has not only helped Roberts, but disabled vets and other former wrestlers get back on their feet -- literally.

Jake ""The Snake"" Roberts, 59 -- The Lowest Point

It was a long journey – it’s been almost three years now. It’s still hard for me to watch this documentary and some of the clips, because I have to see just how bad I was. I didn't see a way out. I had given up on life completely, I was just waiting to die. I was praying it would happen soon. I would get angry hearing someone else had I died. I would get pissed at God, ""How dare you take that son of a b---- and I’m still here.""

I was hurting everyone around me. I didn't have relationships with my eight children and my mother had to watch me suffer. Paula, my mother, she's still around, she’s not that much older than I am. She’s only 13 years older than me and was 12 when she was pregnant with me. There’s a lot of stuff people don’t know about me. My sister being kidnapped and murdered. That was horrible. There are things that happen in your life that are going to be tough. The worst thing you can do is drink or do drugs to self-medicate.

For every addict man, the hardest times are when you’re alone and there’s nobody around. You get up to piss in the middle of the night, you look in that mirror and go, ‘What a piece of s---.‘ Alcohol and drug addiction tells you that you are worthless. It’s pretty easy to believe because you are alone and no one wants to be around you. But they don’t hate you, they hate the addiction.

I’ve been to jail and rehab, I’ve never heard anybody say 'When I was younger, my dream was to become an addict or alcoholic.' It’s not something anyone wants for themselves.

Diamond ""Dallas"" Page, 58 -- We Hadn't Spoken in 5 Years

Jake Roberts and Scott Hall [another veteran wrestler, who went by the name Razor Ramon] were the number 1 and 2 in the dead pool. People would say, ""It’s either Scott Hall or Jake Roberts who dies next.""

In fact, before I went to see Jake three years ago, my father called me up and said, ""They are doing a show on TV, called 'Deaths in Wrestling'"" or something like that and the network was talking about all the guys from the sport who had died. Jake and Scott were two guys that could have been on the top of that list.

When you look back at past wrestlers who have died or committed suicide, guys like Chris Benoit [Benoit murdered his wife and son before hanging himself in 2007. He was 40 years old]. Benoit's father requested an autopsy after his death and they found out he had the brain of an 87-year-old Alzheimer's patient. When you look at football players, hockey players and wrestlers, we take the most beating out of any of them, because we do it 270 nights a year. It was brutal and you don’t realize it when you are living the dream.

As for people who say wrestling is fake, you can’t fake gravity. We are out there putting on a show. We are rock 'n' roll stuntmen gladiators. We are out there driving ourselves and it’s not like someone grabs our bags like in Major League Baseball or takes a jet. You think your job beats you up -- get in the ring and bounce around for 20 minutes, it’s like going through five car accidents.

[Page stresses that the WWE -- World Wrestling Entertainment -- is also one of the best organizations for former wrestlers like Jake and that they actually paid for many of his rehab stints.]

When the dream ends, you're retired and someone like Jake Roberts doesn't know anything but wrestling. Then, [for some guys] the wife’s left, there’s no money and depression’s already set in on a whole different level. When you have 20,000 people screaming your name, there’s no drug like it. And when it stops - it happened to Scott and Jake – they have no place to put their energy. That's when the booze and the pills come and you can easily get lost in it.

But with Jake, he's so talented and charismatic, he did have another life beyond wrestling, he just didn’t know it.

When I went down to see Jake for this documentary and to see what I could do to help, we hadn't talked in five years. I helped him with something, then the addict f----- me. The addict f---- me. The addict will lie and lie and lie, because that’s what the addict does. I just said f--- him, ""I’m gonna stop talking to him"" and we did.

I was as tentative as you can imagine. The only reason I wanted to work with Jake, is because without this guy, without Dusty Rhodes, there is no Diamond Dallas Page. I started wrestling at 35. My career didn’t take off till I was 40. The only reason I was a three-time champion, was because of what Jake Roberts taught me. I always wanted to repay him. Plus, I just missed this guy. This is not a just a friend, I love this guy. I didn't know how bad he was until I saw for myself. I knew he was beat up, but f--- I’m beat up. I didn’t know it was that bad.

My father was an alcoholic, who finally stopped drinking in his 70’s. My dad made a lot of bad decisions. Jake’s a great guy, he just made a lot of bad decisions. I saw so much of my dad in him. I couldn’t help my dad, because ... he’s my dad.

Diamond Dallas Page -- My First Visit to See Jake 3 Years Ago

When I went down to see him, I was assuming he’d been clean. When I’m down there and I’m with Steve Yu, the director of the film, you hear me say, ""When’s the last time you’ve used drugs?"" Now, I don't mean a few drinks, I meant coke and crack. He says, ""About a month ago."" What he means is he used yesterday. Damn, he used last night.

That knocked me over a bit. I knew I had to get clean, organic food in him. When you are dealing with someone at this level, who is an alcoholic, pill head, coke head and crack addict, you need to get real food in that mother----, so he at least starts to feel alive. Not feeling better, but alive. The only reason he hadn’t killed himself was his kids, he’d already done enough damage to them.

We get done talking and I’m thinking let’s try a few moves. He does two moves and he’s breathing heavy and needs to sit down. He can't even stand up by himself. He’s sitting there, I walked into the kitchen and Steve walks up to me, ""What do you think?"" What I wanted to say was ""We’re f----."" I was ready to do what I could for Jake, even move him into my home, but he needed to show me I wasn’t going to do all the work. I need a sign.

I’m getting ready to leave, then he does something I never saw coming. He stands up, no he pushes himself, he looks at me and he goes, ""OK, let’s go!"" I said, ""Go where?"" He says, ""Work out mother-----, what did you come here for?""

I thought in this black hole, I just saw a little glimmer of light.

Jake Roberts -- The First Step: Accepting, Then Kicking Butt

I saw the people Dallas helped. You see the pics of people who have made that journey, then you want that for yourself. I can remember when I lost the first 10 pounds, because it was so long since I had a victory under my name.

As for the bulls--- holding me down, my past that was holding me back -- I didn’t have a choice with my stepmother or father, but that’s what I was given. How you deal with it is up to you. [In the documentary, Jake opens up about the abuse he dealt with at home, growing up.] There’s no forgetting that s---. It’s still there. Now I hold it up like a trophy, I beat this s---.

If you want to stomp the hell out of a problem, there's only one way, you have to accept it, then bring it to light and show others. We are so hung up about, ""I'm not worthy of love, I’m no good."" I see others and because I’m exposing myself now, they feel comfortable exposing their problems. That right there is justification for doing it, for opening up on a stage like this in front of the whole world.

Park city here I come!! #resurrectionofjakethesnake #slamdance pic.twitter.com/OixMK906TN

[Fast Forward -- During the documentary, Roberts has his ups and downs, but comes out better than ever. He said the hardest parts were the fights he had with Page, but that all the work over the long process was worth it. The ending of the movie is an inspiring one that could make even the toughest guy break down in tears.]

Jake Roberts -- Sober Three Years

I’m sober almost three years now. I’ve lost about 80 pounds. When I started I couldn’t get out of a chair by myself, someone had to help me to my feet. Now I can get back in the ring and have fun. I’m feeling better than I’ve felt in 25 years. Not just mentally but physically.

It’s something I’m very proud of. Obviously, it’s probably one of the most important things I’ve ever done in my life -- getting sober. The things that I’ve regained are endless – friends, family and work relationships.

Now, I can be with my grandchildren and hold them and realize what I’ve got. I just had an emotional Christmas with all 10 of my grandchildren, five of my children, including one daughter no one knew about, not even myself. She’s 28 and has her own children. It was just so awesome.

Even though my mom’s in a bad spot -- she’s ill and has breathing issues, heart issues -- I see an overall peace about her. Recently, I asked her what changed, why she seemed so different. She said, ""It’s all you."" I said, ""What do you mean, it’s all me?"" She said, ""It was so painful watching you go through that."" She knew I was a much better person than the way I was behaving and acting like. She saw me quit living and it was hard to watch for her. So, I even put her through it. Brought her into my pain.

Best gift ever, Family! Thank you Megan for the picture! #lillatebutnotsorry pic.twitter.com/5RXri9XRUg

To see her at peace and happy is a gift beyond all expectations.

The biggest is just being able to dream again, now I have dreams again. They are good dreams, not some crack dream, where you wake up in a horrible fit. Now I wake up and I’m excited to live.

Diamond Dallas Page -- Helping Others Like Jake is My Mission

DDP Yoga is not like your usual yoga. It's for guys who usually wouldn't do yoga -- Jake, Scott Hall, Chris Jericho, Dustin Rhodes.

One of the stories that really affects me is this disabled vet Arthur, who went through the program and actually inspired Jake to do the same. He had my DVDs, I gave him my eating plan. I used to email all my clients, he wrote back and said he was relegated to thinking of himself as a piece of furniture. He was obese, disabled, his wife dresses him in his braces every morning, he was 5’6, 297 pounds. That was nine years ago and he was the first person I ever called.

Arthur's story was the video I showed to Jake when we first started and he goes, ""Wow."" I said, ""That could be you.""

Happy. That’s what I feel for Jake now. I was just sitting with Scott Hall and to see his eyes light up. Seeing Jake, someone I've known Jake for 25 years, but I've never met or talked to this Jake Roberts. This guy is so sharp and has so much more clarity now.

Jake Roberts -- My Future

The most important projects now are the ones where I help other people. If I can help others with my journey, it makes me feel positive and propels me to help others even more. When you’re an addict you don’t help anybody man. The only person you’re helping is yourself, because you gotta get your dope. That’s not a life, that’s a slow death.

The real treasure is when a guy walks up to you with his daughter, wife and son, and begins thanking me ""for giving them all back to me."" He was living in the back seat of his car on heroin and saw what I was going through, then just hopped on board with my journey. I want people to reach out to others who are sick, just like Dallas did for me."

The video, which surfaced over the weekend, was posted to Twitter by Unheard, which describes itself as ""an alliance of black students organized for change within campus administration and atmosphere."" The video shows young men on a bus chanting, ""There will never be a n----r at SAE.""

The tweet, directed at OU president David Boren, said, ""Racism is alive at The University of Oklahoma.""

Boren said at a news conference Monday that he was ""sickened by the video,"" and, ""I couldn't sleep after that.""

And the Tri Delta sorority announced that it is investigating the incident. In the video, Tri Delta members are seen singing with SAE members on the charter bus.

""We are deeply disappointed by the conduct of the students involved in the incident at The University of Oklahoma,"" the national Tri Delta sorority said in a statement. ""Tri Delta expects its members to uphold the highest responsibilities of college women. The behavior documented in the video is deplorable and is in no way consistent with Tri Delta's ideals and core values. We are cooperating fully with our partners at the university as they investigate this matter.""

The sorority later issued a followup statement, saying, ""Members of the chapter were not pictured in the video and have not been and are not currently the subject of any investigation. We will continue to cooperate fully with our partners at the university.""

Boren said in an earlier written statement that all ties and affiliations between the school and the SAE chapter are ""hereby severed.""

""To those who have misused their free speech in such a reprehensible way, I have a message for you. You are disgraceful,"" Boren's statement read. ""You have violated all that we stand for. You should not have the privilege of calling yourselves 'Sooners.' Real Sooners are not racist. Real Sooners are not bigots. Real Sooners believe in equal opportunity. Real Sooners treat all people with respect. Real Sooners love each other and take care of each other like family members.

""All of us will redouble our efforts to create the strongest sense of family and community,"" Boren added. ""We vow that we will be an example to the entire country of how to deal with this issue. There must be zero tolerance for racism everywhere in our nation.""

Boren said SAE residents would have to remove their possessions and vacate the house ""by midnight tomorrow.""

At Monday’s news conference, Boren added that he doesn't plan on helping the displaced residents find housing.

""That's not our responsibility,"" he said. ""We don't provide student services to bigots.""

In fact, he said he'd be happy if the ""bus-load"" of students involved left school, adding that the university's legal team is exploring possible further punishment up to and including expulsion.

""As they pack their bags, I hope they think long and hard about what they've done,"" Boren said.

Boren called the video ""heartbreaking for every member of this community.""

The national SAE organization said in its own statement that it closed the Oklahoma Kappa chapter at the University of Oklahoma and suspended all of the fraternity's members -- and the members involved with the incident could have their membership privileges revoked permanently.

""We apologize for the unacceptable and racist behavior of the individuals in the video, and we are disgusted that any member would act in such a way,"" the online statement read. ""Furthermore, we are embarrassed by this video and offer our empathy not only to anyone outside the organization who is offended but also to our brothers who come from a wide range of backgrounds, cultures and ethnicities."""

""Do they appear to be moving at all?"" the dispatcher asked.

""No, they don't.""

A young Utah mother died after an accident sent her car into a river upside-down over the weekend with her 18-month-old daughter in a car seat. Lynn Jennifer Groesbeck, 25, did not survive, but her daughter, Lily, is now in stable condition, the Spanish Fork City Police Department told ABC News.

After spending almost 14 hours suspended upside-down in the overturned car in freezing temperatures with frigid water inches from her head, Lily survived in fleece pants and a sweatshirt because she had several factors on her side, experts told ABC News.

First, the little girl's youth made her less vulnerable because she hasn't had time to damage her organs by smoking, drinking or consuming a high fat diet, which could lessen their ability to withstand trauma from the crash, said Dr. Oscar Guillamondegui, trauma director at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee.

""Children are more resilient than adults,"" Guillamondegui said, adding that he has not treated Lily. ""They don't have the comorbidities of adults.""

In the cold, her body likely prioritized blood flow to her heart, brain and other crucial organs, said Dr. Haitham Haddad, interim division chief of pediatric emergency medicine at University Hospitals Rainbow Babies & Children’s Hospital in Cleveland, Ohio. Haddad did not treat Lily.

Second, although the cold could have led Lily's organs to fail from hypothermia, it also likely put her body into a state of suspended animation, Guillamondegui said, likening it to hibernation. The cold slows the body down, enabling it to withstand the trauma, including potential hypothermia, he said.

Doctors intentionally cool heart attack and bypass patients as part of standard of care to make their chances of survival greater, he said.

""It's a really cool process,"" he said. ""We see it every once in a while.""

And, finally, he guessed the accident didn't cause any major bleeding for Lily. If it had, the cold would have made it worse and could have killed her. ""Because certain aspects of your blood don't work well when it's cold,"" Guillamondegui said.

Overall, he said, it was important to remember that trauma is the number one cause of death for people younger than 45, and that a child's car seat is the safest place to be during an accident."

That’s because the federal government still recognizes the drug as illegal.

""When federal law gets to the point where it's not illegal federally -- because it's just states that have it legal -- once Washington decides that it's going to be legal, then at that point it might be deductible,” said Tom Wheelwright, founder of the CPA firm ProVision. “But right now, it's not.""

What about state tax returns?

“As the name suggests, and I assume people are using it for medicinal reasons, it may qualify as a deduction under the medical expense area,” says Bob Meighan, vice president of TurboTax.

Medicinal marijuana is a murky tax topic which is handled on a state-by-state basis.

Anyone living in one of the states that permit medicinal marijuana use should check state tax law, and hold on to their receipts."

“Yes, he was aware of her email address. He traded emails with her,” Obama spokesman Josh Earnest told ABC’s Jonathan Karl. “But he was not aware of her personal email server or that she was using it exclusively for all her business.”

In an interview Saturday, Obama said he learned of his secretary of state's private email address use through recent news reports, ""the same time everybody else learned it.""

Earnest explained that the president was referring to details of her email system and the fact that she had not been in compliance with State Department policy for nearly six years after failing to submit the records for transfer to government computers.

Clinton has called for the public release of 55,000 emails turned over to the State Department for archiving. Her team handpicked the messages off her private server that pertained to official business; Clinton's camp said roughly 10 percent were of a personal nature and not handed over.

""I'm glad that Hillary [has] instructed that those emails about official business need to be disclosed,"" Obama said Saturday.

Earnest said an independent, third-party review of Clinton's private server should not be required, but suggested that the White House would not oppose one if she elected to do so.

The former Secretary of State has remained mum on the email controversy. She has yet to explain why she exclusively used private email through a server built inside her New York home while Secretary of State, or why it took six years to submit the records as required under the department policy she oversaw.

Officers Tyler Beddoes, Jared Warner and Bryan Dewitt, who responded to the incident in the Spanish Fork River Saturday, say they heard an adult voice say, ""Help me,"" Spanish Fork Police officer Lt. Matt Johnson told ABC News.

Johnson said the two firefighters, Paul Tomadakis and Lee Mecham, also heard the voice before realizing there was a toddler in the car.

""To me, it was plain as day,"" Warner told KSL.com. ""I remember hearing a voice that didn't sound like a child, just saying, 'Help me.'""

The police officers and firemen declined to comment to ABC News.

""There were some individuals on top of the bridge, but all three stated [the voice] came from the vehicle,"" Johnson said. ""It prompted us to lift the car between the three officers and firemen. They physically lifted the car from the side, and they located the infant in the car seat at that time.""

Johnson said the police don't believe the voice came from Groesbeck.

""Due to the trauma she sustained, we suspect she was deceased upon impact. I don’t believe she survived the impact of the car crash. There was massive trauma,"" Johnson said.

""The baby was in a car seat in the backseat on the passenger side,"" Lt. Cory Slaymaker of the Spanish Fork Police Department had said. ""The vehicle was on its top, so the car seat could have been out of the water. The car was on the embankment, so I don't know how much water was getting into the car.""

He said the water was so cold that the rescue crew members could only stay in for short periods of time.

There’s a good chance that if you want it then it is being manufactured in some factory or put together by one of its 1.3 billion citizens. So when I was in Beijing last week I assumed that we could find Apple’s Watch well before it's officially released.

With our research we found good news and bad news. The good news was that we did find a watch that looks like an official Apple Watch with the same color and shape. The bad news was it is a counterfeit. A knock-off. A fake.

I learned about this because the story was being told in newspapers.

We heard there were two possible knock-offs. One called Ai Watch and the other called the D-Watch. We were told that we could buy one of them in a few stores but we took the easier route to buy online from a company called Taobao.

It is like eBay and Amazon put together. But this company is owned by Alibaba, which is growing fast. With our ABC Visa card our associate producer ordered one last Thursday when I was about to board the plane heading home to New York. In a perfect world I could have bought it online and had them mail it directly to my office in the US. But no. Taobao could only send it to an address in China. So when our Beijing team got it they had to send it here, where I got the chance to open it.

What can I say? The differences between the real one and the fake one are huge. On the knock-off there is a screen, but not a touch screen. If you expect an iPhone on your wrist then please just give up. According to the instructions you can use Bluetooth to connect to your phone but only with Android. No chance you can connect to any Apple devices.

So if you want to brag and show off then go ahead and buy one of these. They are much cheaper. We bought ours for $47 instead of the $350 for a real one. It could look good on your wrist but only from afar. Keep it away from the eyes of your friends."

The two sides agreed that a humanitarian corridor would last from 9 a.m.-6 p.m. local time (11 a.m. ET), allowing civilians to evacuate from Debaltseve, a strategic railway hub that has become the epicenter of recent fighting.

BBC News described the town as “almost too dangerous for civilians,” and many have been trapped in the cross-fire, left without power, heating or running water for almost two weeks, reports the Associated Press.

Some 5,400 people have died since April, the UN says, and many that are left in the area surrounding Debaltseve are boarding buses today to escape the fighting. Alexander Motuyanik, a Ukrainian military official told ABC News that the truce will also extend tomorrow from 8 a.m.-10 p.m. local time.

“There are four points that people can choose to evacuate from,” a rebel official told ABC News. “And two directions: into the government-held areas or into the rebel-held areas.” Roughly 1,000 people are expected to be evacuated on Friday, reported the AP.

But it’s not the first truce the two sides have attempted, and a Ukrainian official tells ABC News, “We will see if terrorists respect it.” Echoed on the rebel side, “we will [respect the truce] if Kiev will keep its promise,” a rebel official tells ABC News.

Merkel and Hollande to the Rescue

Just before the truce expires on Friday, German Chancellor Merkel and French President Hollande are expected to meet with Russian President Putin in the Kremlin, ramping up pressure on Russia to agree on a peace plan for Ukraine.

The two European leaders touched down in Moscow after spending the day in Ukraine meeting with officials in Kiev alongside US Secretary of State Kerry.

Few details were released about the meetings, but Ukraine's Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin tweeted that the leaders discussed “steps so that the Minsk agreement can start working.

?????????? ?????, ??? ??????? ???????????? ???????????. ????????: ??? ????????????, ? ?? ?????? ? ???. ??? ??, ?? ?? ?? ????, ?? ? ?????.

Back in September, the two sides signed a truce in Minsk, Belarus that called for a cease-fire and an international monitors along the Ukraine-Russia border, but the deal collapsed. Each side accuse the other of bringing it down.

Following the meetings, Secretary Kerry said “President Putin can make the choices that could end this war.” Adding: ""Let there be no doubt about who is blocking the prospects for peace here,"" Kerry said, directly referring to Moscow.

In a sign of how seriously Europe is taking the recent escalation, this will be Merkel’s first trip to Moscow since the fighting broke out. ""We don't know if we will have long or short talks in Moscow or if these will be the last talks. We can only do what we can to resolve this conflict and especially to end the bloodshed,” she said at a press conference before departing for Moscow.

Her spokesman, Steffen Seibert tweeted: ""Chancellor Merkel on the way to Moscow tweets: We are not neutral agents but demand peace and self-determination of peoples.”

Kanzlerin #Merkel zur Reise nach Moskau: Wir sind keine neutralen Vermittler, sondern fordern Frieden und Selbstbestimmung der Völker.

The frantic diplomatic wrangling comes amid a debate in Washington whether to arm the Ukrainian military, a move both Germany or France believe could risk widening the conflict. Secretary Kerry said President Obama would decide “soon” whether to deliver lethal weapons to Kiev."

The actor says he was almost fired from his iconic role as Michael Corleone in the epic 1972 film.

“They wanted to fire me when I was on the picture ... [during] the shooting, first couple of weeks,” Pacino told ABC News’ “Nightline.” “Because they kept seeing the rushes, you know, or the footage that was shot, and they kept looking at it and thinking, ‘What is he doing?’”

Pacino currently stars as an aging rock star in the film “Danny Collins,” which opens in theaters today.

Pacino went on to portray the mob boss in the rest of the “Godfather” trilogy. But if it weren’t for director Francis Ford Coppola, Pacino said, he wouldn’t have stayed.

“I was so confused at that time, and Francis was so supportive, you know, and so helping me in it, all of it,” Pacino said. “If it wasn't for Francis, I would’ve just not showed up one day and said, ‘Hey, look man, I don't want to be where I'm not wanted.’”

Things changed, Pacino said, when he saw the footage he had already shot and liked how he portrayed his character.

“It was -- yes, a form of innocence or detachment in a crazy way. It was a kind of detachment. And then so that when the character finally emerges … you say where did that come from? That was what I was really going after,” Pacino recalled.

“The Godfather” restaurant scene, he said, is what kept him in the picture.

“Without the great Sterling Hayden and ... little Al Lettieri, I wouldn't be here today. They'd have let me go for -- even Frances couldn't stop them,” Pacino said.

“And I guess the way it was directed and the way it came off, they said, ""Okay, we'll keep him.'"""

“It will be one of these moments that created a unity of purpose and a unity of effort among the nations [of the world,]"" Allen, the Special Presidential Envoy for the Global Coalition to Counter ISIS, said from Amman, Jordan.

“King Abdullah has indicated the desire to do more in the aftermath of this horrific killing,” Allen said. “He’s been a leader in this process.”

With Jordan conducting more airstrikes over Syria, Allen believes “it’s galvanized the coalition” fighting ISIS.

The importance of forging a strong coalition is a lesson Allen knows well. In Iraq, he helped unite Sunni tribes in the fight against al Qaeda and formed relationships with Middle Eastern leaders who are now involved in the fight against ISIS.

But until the past week, Allen faced difficulties in forming a true coalition. The U.S. has been responsible for more than 80 percent of all the air strikes against ISIS.

While ISIS has now been run out of Kobani, Syria, by Kurdish forces, much of the country remains a battle ground.

“It’s a very important concern. We don’t have a partner in Syria as we do in Iraq,” said Allen.

Even in Iraq, ISIS controls one-third of the country and it remains to be seen if Iraqi security forces are capable of retaking territory.

“We work very hard at several levels to prepare the Iraqi security forces to do this. We have advise and assist elements that are with them today,” Allen said. “There are elements of the Iraqi security forces that are in fact in action today.”

Allen also believes that ISIS’s own actions – like the video of al-Kasabeh's purported death – will help defeat them, saying the terror group “is beginning to eat itself with increasing numbers of reports of ISIL executing foreign fighters who have come from long distances to be part of this.”

But the shadow of ISIS has far reach. When asked if the terror group remains a threat to the homeland, Allen said, “I think we should take it very seriously.”"

James Robertson, a factory worker from Detroit, has been walking over 10 miles to and from his job for the past 10 years since his last car broke down.

On Friday, a local Ford dealership invited Robertson to test drive cars and surprised him with a new red Ford Taurus.

“I don’t like it. I love it,” he said, sitting in his new car. “If only my parents could see me now.”

According to the Monroeville Police Department, the mall was put on lockdown as police investigated. After it was searched twice and cleared, the lockdown was lifted.

Of the three people shot -- two male and one female -- two were in critical condition, Monroeville Police Chief Doug Cole said, though he did not specify which of the victims those were.

It appeared that the shooter targeted the victims, Cole said, but said it did not appear that a fight led to shooting.

Monroeville Mayor Gregory Erosenko said police don't yet know what led to the incident, which occurred around 7:45 p.m.

""This is private property. We're there to serve them and help them but they certainly will dictate where we go from here,"" he said.

He said the mall, though private, is heavily policed.

""When people want to do something bad, I could have a 100 cops down there and it's just the way it is,"" he said.

Witness Josh Vehar told ABC that he saw a group of kids standing around and saw a young male holding a black gun from that first group fire six or seven shots at another group of young people.

He said he was was 20 to 30 feet away from the shooting at the Mr. Roger's Neighborhood Play area in the mall with his 5-year-old daughter, and other children were playing at the time shots fired.

""I watched this kid pull his gun out and when he pulled the gun out, he just started firing,"" Vehar said. ""He shot like 6, 7 times and then it just turned into pandemonium after that."""

Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives agents also concluded that the fire, which started in the home's great room, was an accident, caused by a faulty power outlet set into the floor near the tree.

The rapid combustion of the tree - combined with wide-open chambers of the mansion - supplied ample oxygen to fuel the blaze, according to ATF investigators.

""While the explanation that has been shared with us today does not bring solace, it does start us down the long road to acceptance,"" read a statement issued today from the Boone and Pyle families.

It took almost a week for six bodies to be found in the burned-down mansion. All those who were thought to be inside are believed to be accounted for, according to fire department officials.

The 16,000-square-foot mansion was owned by tech executive Don Pyle and his wife Sandra.

According to relatives, the Pyles had four of their grandchildren -- Alexis (Lexi) Boone, 8; Kaitlyn (Katie) Boone, 7; Charlotte Boone, 8; and, Wesley (Wes) Boone, 6 -– over at the time of the four-alarm fire.

Crews started going through the wreckage last Wednesday, according to ABC News affiliate WJLA, a process that ATF investigators said could take weeks.

The house was ""built more like a commercial structure,"" said Anne Arundel County Fire Capt. Russ Davies, adding that searching is a ""time-consuming process.""

Initially, the fire had been handled as a criminal investigation.

Relatives described the Pyles as loving grandparents nicknamed “Pop-Pop” and “Dee-Dee.” The night before the blaze, Don and Sandra treated their four grandchildren to a special outing to Medieval Times, according to a family spokeswoman -– even taking them to Target beforehand to pick up costumes for the occasion.

""It is our hope that each of you are strengthened in your resolve to cherish your family, friends, and good times. With life so fleeting, make every day and every moment a special time with those you love,"" the statement from the victims families continued. ""We believe that life is about making memories. As we work through our pain and loss, the memories we made with our family will sustain us.""

Authorities said at today's news conference that they would conduct additional tests and analysis."

Nearly as many, 46 percent, see her unfavorably, up 20 percentage points from its low during her term as secretary of state.

See PDF with full results, charts and tables here.

Yet Clinton still is better off than six potential GOP candidates tested in this survey, produced for ABC by Langer Research Associates: All of them have higher unfavorable than favorable scores, trouble for any public figure. And two for the first time are seen unfavorably by more than half of Americans.

Jeb Bush’s favorable-unfavorable rating is 33-53 percent; Chris Christie’s, 26-51 percent. Compared with Clinton, more Americans have yet to form an opinion of Bush, Christie, or, especially, the others tested in this poll: Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, Marco Rubio and Scott Walker. Still, Cruz’s favorability rating, like Bush’s, is underwater by 20 points, Rubio’s by 14, Paul’s by 13 and Walker’s – the least-known – by 7. Christie’s worst off, 25 points in the hole.

PRIMARY PREFERENCE – Bush, regardless, has advanced to 21 percent support for the nomination in a crowded potential Republican field, up 7 points from December to a significant lead over his closest competitors, Walker, with 13 percent (up 6 points), and Cruz, 12 percent. That’s among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents who are registered to vote.

The 11 other possible GOP candidates tested in the poll all are in the single digits: Rubio, Paul and Mike Huckabee, with 8 percent support apiece; Christie, with 7; retired surgeon Ben Carson, with 6; and 1 or 2 percent each for Carly Fiorina, Lindsay Graham, Bobby Jindal, John Kasich, Rick Perry and Rick Santorum. Clinton continues to cruise on the Democratic side, with 66 percent support against five others – more than quintuple her nearest potential rivals, Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren, with 12 percent apiece. (Warren this week said she won’t run.)

Bernie Sanders has 5 percent; Jim Webb, 1 percent; and Martin O’Malley less than half a percent. Clinton does even better in the expectations game: 72 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents say they expect her to win her party’s nomination. On the far more closely contested GOP side, a third of leaned Republicans expect Bush to win. That, of course, is if they run. Of all these, just Cruz has announced his candidacy. ABC’s Political Unit reports that Paul, Rubio and Clinton may do so this month, Bush in late spring or summer.

PRESIDENTIAL PREFERENCE – Head-to-head, Clinton leads Bush by 12 points among registered voters, 53-41 percent, essentially unchanged in the past year. She has 54 to 56 percent support against Rubio, Walker and Cruz alike, vs. their 39 to 40 percent."

The National Weather Service issued winter storm warnings for central New York, the western Catskills and much of New England through early Tuesday.

This new storm has the city of Boston in the bull’s-eye once again with another set of records on slate to be broken.

So far this season Boston has received more than 62 inches of snow, well above the city's seasonal average of a little more than 40 inches. That total includes more than 8 inches of snow that fell this weekend.

Just a couple weeks ago, Boston experienced its snowiest week on record, setting the stage for increasing concerns for what to do with all the snow.

Boston Mayor Marty Walsh said the city is running out of places to put all the snow.

""We've never seen this type of snow here in the city of Boston, any other time in the history of our city,"" he said.

Other weekend snowfall totals include nearly 10 inches in Plymouth County, Massachusetts, and 9 inches in parts of New Hampshire.

Heavy snow was reported in parts of Vermont with snow falling from Buffalo to the coast of Maine. A wintry mix is expected for locations along the Pennsylvania and New York state line east to the southern New England Coast.

Areas of freezing rain are expected to lead to icy roads near Interstate 80, with heavy snow expected to continue for areas farther north. The wintry mix is expected to change to all snow throughout the day, as colder air will be moving south.

The highest snow amounts are forecast to fall from central New York State to New England with Boston and the surrounding area expected to see the biggest snow totals once again. By tonight, areas farther south will see some light snow accumulations as well, as the wintry mix changes over to snow even briefly as far south as Philadelphia.

The storm is expected to wrap up by early Tuesday morning with quieter weather expected for the middle of the week.

But though ISIS produced pictures of the bombed-out building, it did not provide any evidence that Mueller was there. Previously, ISIS has shown photographs of casualties on both sides of the Syrian conflict to brag about killings or memorialize the deaths of its own fighters. The relative photographic silence when it comes to Mueller’s death has been deafening, according to former U.S. officials.

“I think we should be skeptical for several reasons,” Retired Lt. Gen. Mike Barbero, former deputy commander of U.S. Forces-Iraq, told ABC News today. “These are masters of using video and social media to exploit, recruit [and there’s been] no evidence from them… I think they’d show if it was the case, they would show some sort of evidence.”

“My sense is that they’ve not shown us more because they have nothing to show us,” said Brad Garrett, a former special agent with the FBI and ABC News consultant. “The whole thing is completely fishy that what they’re saying is on the up-and-up… I have complete doubts about the truthfulness of this story.”

Matt Olsen, former Director of the National Counterterrorism Center, said it was “quite relevant” that ISIS hasn’t tried to show proof of Mueller’s death.

“ISIS has not hesitated in the past to show gruesome images of executions and death, so at this point I think we need to be quite skeptical of any claim that they’ve made that Kayla Mueller was killed… until such a claim is fully corroborated,” said Olsen, who is also an ABC News consultant.

But Barbero said it would be difficult to determine for sure if ISIS is lying as well.

“It would be absolutely hard, if not impossible to verify one way or another unless you had some physical evidence or some source on the ground to determine whether she had been killed or not,” he said.

U.S. counter-terrorism officials have bemoaned the lack of on-the-ground intelligence available in Syria.

Mueller’s parents, who live in Arizona, are clinging to hope in the absence of certainty, according to family friend Todd Geiler."

Maxxzandra Ford's newborn son, Avery, is the heaviest infant to ever be born at St. Joseph's Women's Hospital in Tampa, Florida, according to the hospital.

Ford, who already has a 1-year-old son and 6-year-old daughter, didn't realize at first she was pregnant, according to St. Joseph's Hospitals spokeswoman Nancy Gay and ABC News affiliate WFTS-TV in Tampa.

Ford's husband recommended she take a pregnancy test after she started to gain weight in the fall, and the test confirmed the pregnancy.

""She knew she gained a lot of weight and thought she might be having twins because she was a twin,"" Gay said.

A doctor figured out that the mother of two was actually 35 weeks along in her pregnancy.

Ford's doctors estimated based on ultrasounds that her son would weigh a hefty 10 pounds, so everyone was surprised when she gave birth to a 14.1-pound baby.

""When I felt his head come out, I knew he was bigger than 10 pounds,"" Ford told WFTS-TV.

Avery was born on Jan. 29 and is expected to get out of the hospital in the next few days. Both mother and son are healthy and doing well, Gay said.

The hefty newborn is still a bit smaller than the largest baby ever born, according to Guinness World Records. In 1879, Ann Bates of Canada gave birth to a newborn who weighed in at a whopping 23 pounds, 12 ounces."

Asteroid 2004 BL86 made its closest approach to Earth on Monday morning, coming within 745,000 miles -- about 3.1 times the distance between the Earth and the moon.

The first images released by NASA show the asteroid has a moon measuring about 230 feet wide. As many as 150 asteroids have a companion moon, with some even having two, according to NASA.

While the latest asteroid pass was not visible to the naked eye, it brought with it plenty of excitement as it made what is believed to be its closest brush with humanity for the next two centuries.

The next time an asteroid will brush this closely past Earth will be in 2027 when asteroid 1999 AN10 zooms by our planet."

UVA Police received the information of the alleged assault Thursday, though the assault was said to have occurred six days earlier. This was the same weekend that sorority members were ordered to stay in their houses and not participate in fraternity activities for the weekend.

“On February 5, 2015, The University of Virginia Police Department received information from the Office of the Dean of Students about a sexual assault incident reported to have occurred on January 30, 2015, in a residence hall on-Grounds,” Chief of University Police Michael Gibson, said in an email to students last night.

“This information is being released in accordance with the federal Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act. The Clery Act requires all colleges and universities that participate in federal financial aid programs to keep and disclose information about crime on and near their respective campuses, including timely warnings of crimes that may represent a serious or ongoing threat to the safety of students or employees.”

The University of Virginia has faced pressure to change the way they handle sexual assault on campus in the past few months after a now-discredited story in the Rolling Stone detailing a culture of rape and sexual violence at a fraternity house.

Virginia state lawmakers are weighing legislation that would require university employees to report any sexual assault to law enforcement. HB1930 is advancing in the House of Delegates and is sponsored by Delegate Robert Bell, a Republican from Albemarle. Some worry that this legislation could discourage victims from reporting.

University of Virginia Deputy Spokesperson Matthew Charles gave ABC News the following statement on the January 30 incident:
""The University of Virginia Police Department issued a timely warning notice pursuant to the Clery Act on Thursday evening related to information it received regarding a reported sexual assault incident on Jan. 30 at a residence hall.
The matter is being reviewed in accordance with Title IX, the Clery Act, the 2013 Violence Against Women Act, and university policies, and no further comments are anticipated at this time.""

The college has taken a number of steps aimed at improving campus safety including posting monitors at frat parties and forbidding beer kegs and mixed drinks."

Each white dwarf star has a weight similar to the sun, and they orbit around each other every 4.2 hours in a slow death spiral.

Their distance is slowly being erased to the extent that astronomers believe the stars will crash into each other in 700 million years in a most spectacular fashion -- the first observed candidates for a kind of supernova known as a ""Type 1a,"" which until now has been posited only in theory.

Researchers said both stars are in the oddly shaped Henize 2-428 nebula. Before the explosive transformation into a supernova, the white dwarf will often fuse with a partner star to gain matter.

In this case, the fused white dwarf stars will have 1.8 times the mass of the sun before it collapses and explodes so brightly that the distant cosmic occurrence would be visible from Earth, according to researchers.

It's the first time researchers have observed a ""Type 1a"" supernova in the making, according to findings that were published Monday in the journal ""Nature.""

In the more well-known variety of supernova, a star that is massive enough -- at least several times the mass of our sun -- will collapse and explode after running out of all its nuclear fuel and the core fuses lighter elements into iron."

The actor says he was almost fired from his iconic role as Michael Corleone in the epic 1972 film.

“They wanted to fire me when I was on the picture ... [during] the shooting, first couple of weeks,” Pacino told ABC News’ “Nightline.” “Because they kept seeing the rushes, you know, or the footage that was shot, and they kept looking at it and thinking, ‘What is he doing?’”

Pacino currently stars as an aging rock star in the film “Danny Collins,” which opens in theaters today.

Pacino went on to portray the mob boss in the rest of the “Godfather” trilogy. But if it weren’t for director Francis Ford Coppola, Pacino said, he wouldn’t have stayed.

“I was so confused at that time, and Francis was so supportive, you know, and so helping me in it, all of it,” Pacino said. “If it wasn't for Francis, I would’ve just not showed up one day and said, ‘Hey, look man, I don't want to be where I'm not wanted.’”

Things changed, Pacino said, when he saw the footage he had already shot and liked how he portrayed his character.

“It was -- yes, a form of innocence or detachment in a crazy way. It was a kind of detachment. And then so that when the character finally emerges … you say where did that come from? That was what I was really going after,” Pacino recalled.

“The Godfather” restaurant scene, he said, is what kept him in the picture.

“Without the great Sterling Hayden and ... little Al Lettieri, I wouldn't be here today. They'd have let me go for -- even Frances couldn't stop them,” Pacino said.

“And I guess the way it was directed and the way it came off, they said, ""Okay, we'll keep him.'"""
1CfUFav,2015-03-27 00:00:00,Boyfriend of Denise Huskins Says He Was Not Involved in a 'Hoax' - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/US/boyfriend-denise-huskins-involved-hoax/story?id=29928317,"The boyfriend of a California woman who was reported abducted but found safe two days later said Thursday that he was not involved in a ""hoax.""

""Our client has no responsibility for this kidnapping,"" said the attorney for Anthony Quinn, the man from whose home the woman was allegedly abducted. ""He is in terrible shape -- mental and physical.""

Police in Vallejo, California, said on Wednesday they found ""no evidence to support the claims"" that Denise Huskins was abducted from a home there before she was found alive two days later and more than 400 miles away. The home from which Huskins, 29, was reportedly taken belongs to Quinn, 30.

""He was forced to drink something that even the kidnappers said was a drug,"" Russo said.

Quinn's attorney said they do not know why authorities are implying the incident is a ""hoax.""

""Besides the fact that our client was used as a football, we still don't want to jeopardize authorities' attempt to put the [suspect] behind bars,"" Russo said.

Quinn's attorney said they don't know where Huskins is and they instructed Quinn not to try to reach her, so he hasn't, though he wanted to contact her when he learned she was discovered.

Huskins' family said Quinn is the man who called 911 hours after her ""abduction."" Vallejo Police Lt. Kenny Park said the two were dating.

Quinn has a ""very good relationship with the woman who was kidnapped and his concern was that the woman was not killed or harmed,"" Russo said, adding that neither person has ""any drug or alcohol issues.""

""There seems to be a stream of blatant lies about our client, about the victim, and everything else that's going on,"" Russo said.

Police said that Quinn told authorities that whoever abducted Huskins made an $8,500 ransom demand.

""There is something very, very off about this investigation,"" said Quinn's attorney Amy Morton, adding that authorities have given ""lies"" to Morton and Russo.

""It's important to note all the ransom notes were not directed to her parents or family, they were directed toward [Quinn],"" Russo said.

Huskins, a physical therapist, was found in Huntington Beach, California, on Wednesday morning, police said. Her father, Mike Huskins, told ABC News that his daughter called him from Huntington Beach to say she was safe.

Huskins had promised through family members to speak with investigators but as of late Wednesday they were unable to contact her or her family, police said, adding that she has since retained an attorney. Huskins could not be reached for comment by ABC News Thursday.

""All indications initially were that she would be cooperative with the investigation,"" Park said during a news conference Wednesday night. But ""as of right now, we have not heard from Ms. Huskins.""

The FBI, which assisted Vallejo police in its investigation, had arranged for an aircraft to bring her from Huntington Beach to Northern California for the interview, police said. But, detectives said yesterday they don't know where she is.

""There is no evidence to support the claims that this was a stranger abduction or an abduction at all,"" read a statement from the Vallejo Police Department. ""Given the facts that have been presented thus far, this event appears to be an orchestrated event and not a kidnapping.""

Huskins was reported missing at 1:55 p.m. Monday by what police described as a 30-year-old man who called to report the alleged kidnapping and claimed he witnessed it. Police previously said that Huskins was abducted from the home where she was staying in Vallejo hours earlier, at about 3:30 a.m.

The San Francisco Chronicle on Wednesday reported it received an email the day before from an ""anonymous person claiming to be holding Denise Huskins.""

The newspaper reported the email said that Huskins ""will be returned safely [Wednesday]"" and that ""any advance on us or our associates will create a dangerous situation for Denise.""

The email was also reported to include an audio file of a woman identifying herself as Huskins who referred to Tuesday's plane crash in southern France -- ostensibly as a time marker for proof of life -- and identified the first concert she had attended in her life, the name of a childhood friend she attended the concert with, and the name of the friend's mother as proof of her identity.

""That was her. The tape recording was her. That I know. They said they were going to drop her off and they did,"" Mike Huskins told the Chronicle after being played the audio recording. ""I'm relieved. You have to expect the worst -- but in my heart, I knew she was still alive.""

Police in Vallejo said they received the same email and audio file but did not confirm its contents.

Vallejo police said in its statement that it would request either state or federal charges ""if evidence indicates that either Ms. Huskins or Mr. Quinn have committed a criminal act.""

""The Vallejo Police Department would like to ensure the public that there is no indication that this was a random act of violence,"" police said in its statement.

More than 40 detectives from the local, state and police levels assisted in the investigation and search for Huskins, Park said.

""That is a tremendous amount of resources that in my opinion was wasted,"" he said, adding that the search could be classified as a ""wild goose chase.""

The investigation is ongoing and police are still trying to determine whether anyone else was involved, Park said. The FBI declined to comment and directed ABC News to Vallejo police."
1CfWVkE,2015-03-02 00:00:00,More Snow and Ice Impact Weekend Plans; New Storm On the Way - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/US/snow-ice-impact-weekend-plans-storm/story?id=29313892,"Another blast of snow and ice impacted weekend plans from the Midwest to the Northeast on Sunday.

A half foot of snow was reported from central Missouri to the central Ohio Valley through Sunday morning. Up to 9 inches of snow fell in central Illinois and snowfall accumulations hit 8 inches in northern Indiana.

The southern side of this latest winter storm brought freezing rain to the mid-Atlantic region Sunday morning. The freezing rain eventually moved farther north, reaching central Pennsylvania to New Jersey by Sunday afternoon.

More than a quarter inch of ice accumulated in parts of Maryland, with a glaze to two-10ths of an inch of ice reported throughout much of the mid-Atlantic, icing over roads and causing numerous accidents throughout the day.

On Sunday evening, the heaviest of the precipitation was focused over the Northeast with snow falling from New York City north to Boston, and freezing rain falling for areas south of Interstate 80.

The highest snowfall totals in the Northeast will stretch from northwestern Pennsylvania and along the New York state line into southern New England. More than 6 inches of snow is expected in this region, with isolated totals up to 8 inches possible.

The heaviest of the snow will fall just south of Boston, however several inches of snow are expected there as well. With 5.6 inches of snow, this winter would tie the record for the city's all-time snowiest season, and it looks like they will come up just short of that with this event.

The snow and freezing rain will end early Monday morning, right before the busy morning commute. However, some slick spots on area roadways are still possible.

Another winter storm will be taking aim on millions of Americans beginning Monday night and hitting many of the same locations that received snow over the weekend.

However, the next storm will track north and bring more rain than snow to many cities. Some heavy rain is possible as well prompting flooding concerns from the Tennessee Valley to New England given the current widespread snow cover throughout the country."
1Cg6Rue,2015-01-28 00:00:00,"5-Year-Old Girl Dies After Catching the Flu, Even After Getting Vaccine - ABC News",http://abcnews.go.com/Health/year-girl-dies-catching-flu-vaccine/story?id=28526729,"A Las Vegas kindergartner who died days after coming down with the flu felt well enough to play outside 24 hours before she collapsed, her father told ABC News.

Kiera Driscoll, 5, had a slight fever on Sunday morning, but she seemed to be feeling better after taking some children's ibuprofen, said her father, Patrick Driscoll.

""In fact, she was playing outside that afternoon with my wife and even made a comment that it was 'the most fun time ever,'"" Driscoll said.

But then Kiera's slight fever returned and her cough worsened and included phlegm, Driscoll said. At about 4 a.m., her parents gave her medicine to help expand her airways by way of an albuterol nebulizer. She didn't have asthma but occasionally had a barking cough as a baby, Driscoll said. Afterward, he stayed up with her watching cartoons until she fell asleep again at 8 a.m.

That morning, the Driscolls took her to an urgent care center, where she got another albuterol treatment and was given a steroid to help her breathe, Driscoll said. He went to work, and his wife stayed home to take care of Kiera.

Kiera's mother tucked her into bed a few hours later for a nap, and turned away to turn on a vaporizer when Kiera said, ""I can't breathe. It's hard to breathe,"" Driscoll said. Then, the little girl collapsed and passed out.

Kiera's mother is trained in CPR and jumped into action, clearing Kiera's airways, performing rescue breathing and calling 911, Driscoll said. Kiera's pulse went away and came back in the emergency room. But her brain wave activity diminished, Driscoll said, and she developed an irregular heart beat and went into cardiac arrest. She died the following day, on Tuesday, Jan. 20.

""Their working diagnosis was that a mucus plug of thick mucus got coughed up and clogged, lodged in her trachea, preventing her from being able to breathe,"" Driscoll said.

The little girl's elementary school celebrated her life last week by dressing in purple, releasing purple balloons and eating frozen yogurt, according to KNTV, ABC's affiliate in Las Vegas. ""Frozen"" was Kiera's favorite movie, and a stuffed Olaf doll sat in her seat at school after her death, according to the station.

Laurel Beckstead, the headmaster of the American Heritage Academy, where Kiera went to school, told KNTV the death was shocking. Beckstead is also Kiera's aunt.

""She went home happy, healthy, and then to get a phone call that Monday that she had gone to Quick Care Monday morning, released and went home and then later collapsed, was almost a shocking disbelief,"" Beckstead told the station. ""How can this be happening to Kiera?""

As of the week ending Jan. 17, 56 pediatric flu-related deaths had been reported to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Kiera's official cause of death was that she went into cardiac arrest after coming down with influenza A and pneumonia, according to the Clark County coroner's office in Nevada, which did not examine her body after her death.

Dr. Frank Esper, a pediatric infectious disease physician at UH Rainbow Babies and Children’s Hospital in Cleveland, said death's like Kiera's can be confusing, and some states require autopsies when the explanation is unclear. He said it's important to remember that influenza can cause death, especially in people with underlying lung and heart conditions -- which may not be diagnosed. People at risk for complications, including young children, pregnant women, people with asthma, and the elderly, should contact their physician at the first sign of flu, he said. They may be prescribed antiviral medications to shorten their illness and prevent it from worsening.

""Though Kiera's passing has shattered the world her birth created for me, the joy of raising her was worth it,"" Driscoll said of his daughter at her funeral. He shared the eulogy on  a fundraising page set up for Kiera to express his gratitude for the love and support his family received

Driscoll told ABC News that Kiera got a flu shot, and they still want other parents to vaccinate their children.

""Vaccines help save lives, and they help keep other people from getting infected as well,"" he said. ""We always want people to be vaccinated.""

He said his family has taken comfort in the fact that his wife knew CPR and did everything she could. And he knows he'll see his little girl again someday, he said.

""If there's something we can say to someone going through something similar,"" he said. ""Hold on to your faith. Rely on family and community, and never take a moment for granted."""
1CgEJVv,2015-03-27 00:00:00,"In Kony Hunt, US Courts Defectors With Pop Music - ABC News",http://abcnews.go.com/International/kony-hunt-us-courts-defectors-pop-music/story?id=29908840,"Three and a half years after President Barack Obama sent 100 special operations troops to Africa to help root out Lord’s Resistance Army leader Joseph Kony – so far unsuccessfully – the broader U.S.-supported international anti-LRA team has resorted to using a truly unstoppable force against the alleged war criminal: pop music.

Blasted over helicopter loudspeakers buzzing over the jungle and often on the radio, the song “Come Home” by popular Ugandan pop star Chameleone urges Kony’s followers to turn their back on the purportedly crazed leader. Chameleone composed the song in 2013 at the behest of U.S. embassy officers who were looking for innovative ways to reach would-be defectors, according to Marty Regan, a field representative for the U.S. State Department’s Bureau of Conflict and Stabilization Operations in Uganda.

Chameleone told ABC News he wrote the song to try and “cajole” Kony, who he says is a fan, “out of the bush.” In the song, he urges LRA members, “Your mother, father and family are waiting for you… do not suffer out there thinking nobody cares about you…”

“I am simply waiting for my brothers in the LRA to come home. You are forgiven,” he sings.

Regan echoed the song’s sentiments: “The message that it conveys is this: you were abducted, this is not your fault, this is your land, and you are welcome back here.”

The pop music initiative is part of a concentrated effort between the U.S. and its partners to reach out to local communities and develop reintegration programs for defectors. In addition to playing “Come Home” on the radio and over the helicopter loudspeakers, the program uses radio interviews, thousands of air-dropped leaflets and posters to reach out to communities.

The public relations effort, coupled with increased military pressure against the LRA forces, is what Regan attributes to a drastic decrease in LRA numbers. According to Regan, the LRA force is thought to be down to around 150 members, a far cry from the thousand militants it used to command in 2009.

Although the LRA is now in what Regan deemed “survival mode,” resorting to banditry and looting rather than mass abductions and murders, the memories of the atrocities the LRA committed is enough to strike fear in the local communities.

“It has not been long since they were a horrible force there,” said Regan. “As long as Joseph Kony is at large, while their ability to reconstitute themselves is questionable, the fact that he’s still out there is of concern.”

The State Department says that as the LRA’s leader, Kony is wanted for “among other acts, forced enlistment of children as soldiers through abduction, sexual enslavement, and intentionally directing attacks against civilian populations.” An INTERPOL Red Notice says Kony has been charged with 12 counts of “crimes against humanity” and another 21 “war crimes.”

Speaking in 2012 about his decision the previous October to send the 100 U.S. “advisors” after Kony, President Obama told ABC News, “None of these decisions are easy, but those who are familiar with the Lord’s Resistance Army and their leader, Mr. Kony, know that these are some of the most vicious killers.”

“They terrorize villages. They take children into custody and turn them into child soldiers. They engage in rape and slaughter in villages they go through. They have been the scourge on the Uganda and that entire region, East Africa,” Obama said then.

The State Department’s use of pop music against the terror group was reported in the organization’s regular State Magazine. Regan is quoted in an article there as saying that despite the atrocities the LRA has committed, most defectors seem surprisingly “normal.”

“I have met with a number of LRA defectors. When you meet them, you are almost taken aback by how ‘normal’ they appear,” Regan said. “They appear to be humble, regular people. While you can sympathize with all of them who ended up in the LRA after being abducted at a young age, many of the defectors were long time fighters who murdered, mutilated and raped innocent people.”

The magazine said that 250 LRA members are believed to have defected since 2012. A State Department fact sheet put out the same year said that since the year 2000, more than 12,000 “former LRA fighters and abductees” have left the group and have been reintegrated through a local amnesty program.

Millions of Americans first heard about Kony and his group’s purported atrocities when a 30-minute web video called “Kony 2012” went viral that year. As of this publication, the video has over 100 million views.

The U.S. government is offering $5 million for information leading to Kony’s arrest or conviction."
1CGqCd5,2015-02-01 00:00:00,Super Bowl 2015: 5 Storylines to Watch - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/super-bowl-2015-storylines-watch/story?id=28556417,"Anticipation is building toward what will be the biggest game of the year -- Super Bowl XLIX.

As we get closer to kickoff, here are some of the key storylines involving the New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks.

1. How Will the Patriots Respond to Deflate-gate?

Deflate-gate is no longer taking up center stage as the actual game has bumped the controversy out of the spotlight for now. But with many questions still remaining around the scandal, the Patriots are still being asked about the investigation and the state of footballs during the AFC Championship Game two weeks ago.

Whether the Patriots win or lose the Super Bowl, many critics say the scandal is yet another controversy surrounding the team that has tainted their recent run, which includes six Super Bowl appearances and three wins.

Meanwhile, the NFL has reportedly zeroed in on a Patriots locker room attendant who allegedly took the AFC Championship Game balls from the officials' locker room to another area on the way to the field.

2. ""U Mad Bro""

It was more than two years ago that the Seahawks and Patriots last played on the same field, and boy, it was a fantastic game filled with good football and a viral moment still being talked about.

The Seahawks came from behind to defeat the Patriots Oct. 14, 2012 by one point. Many point to that game as the moment Russell Wilson and the Seahawks finally arrived in the NFL and became contenders. And since that game, the Seahawks haven't been ignored by anyone.

But the most-talked about moment came when Richard Sherman ran down the field and taunted Brady. After the game, Sherman posted a photo of himself yelling at Brady with the text ""U mad bro?"" He later deleted the tweet, but as they say, the rest is history. The viral moment also made Sherman, who was already a standout cornerback, a household name.

3. Richard Sherman vs. Darrelle Revis

So who's is the NFL's best cornerback? There's a good chance the Super Bowl can settle that debate as two of the league's very best will face each other on the field.

There are stats that anyone can analyze and say that Sherman is better than Revis and vice versa: Sherman had eight interceptions this season compared to Revis' two. Revis is more versatile when it comes to defensive formations, while Sherman is more of a traditional cornerback.

Sherman and Revis were also involved in an epic Twitter war two years ago over whom the better cornerback was in the league. Here's just a taste of their war or words:

I never seen a man before run his mouth so much like girl. This dude just steady putting my name in his mouth to get notoriety @rsherman_25

@Revis24 don't need ya name... Ur name will be irrelevant once u step back on the field bruh. Get ya picks up!

4. Legacies on the Line

With three Super Bowl rings on his hand, Tom Brady's legacy is no doubt secure. However, if Brady can hoist the Vince Lombardi Trophy again, he will join hall of famers Joe Montana and Terry Bradshaw as the only other quarterback with four Super Bowls. It's an elite class and another achievement on Brady's already decorated resume.

On the other side of the field, Russell Wilson is looking to win back-to-back titles. If he can pull it off, he would be the first quarterback to do so since the man he's facing tonight. That means Wilson would have two Super Bowl titles at 26 years old. Brady was 27 by the time he captured his second ring.

Wilson is drawing a lot of comparisons to Brady's rise to stardom. Another Super Bowl for Wilson puts him in the elite quarterback conversation at a very young age.

5. Will Marshawn Lynch Have Another 'Fine' Performance?

The fines just keep on coming for Seahawks' star running back Marshawn Lynch, who clearly has a beef with the media and tries to avoid them at all costs.

At this past Tuesday's Media Day, Lynch answered every question with some slight variation of: ""I'm just here so I won't get fined."" When Lynch was in front of the media the next day, it was more of the same.

In November, he was fined $50,000 for not talking to reporters. Lynch was also fined $11,050 for grabbing his crotch after a touchdown in December. He was fined $20,000 for doing the same thing in the NFC Championship Game.

Who knows what Lynch could do tonight that will get under the skin of NFL officials. Stay tuned.

Ford, 72, was forced to make an emergency landing at Penmar Golf Course, just west of Santa Monica Municipal Airport, at 2:20 p.m. PST Thursday after the engine of the Ryan ST3KR plane he was flying failed, said NTSB and Los Angeles fire officials. He was taken to a nearby hospital in ""fair to moderate"" condition, said Patrick Butler with the Los Angeles Fire Department.

Ford reported engine trouble shortly after taking off from Santa Monica Municipal Airport and asked for an immediate return to the airport, said NTSB investigator Patrick Jones. He then reported that his aircraft came up short of the runway, according to air traffic controller transmissions from LiveATC.net.

The vintage airplane that Ford was piloting clipped a tree before crashing, said Jones.

Elaine Miller told ABC station KABC that the pilot was able to speak and ""expressed that he was in pain."" She and several others helped him out of the plane after it crashed.

""He had a significant head wound,"" said Miller. ""He asked someone to hold his legs up, and people were just saying, 'you’re okay, the fire department is on its way,' and...once police and fire started to arrive, my friends and I sort of backed away and went to the other side of the course to give them room.""

Carlos Gomez, who lives across the street from the golf course, described the plane crash as sounding like a boom.

""I hear a lot of ambulances and I come outside and see people from the golf course pull a man from the plane,"" he said. ""He was moving his arms and legs. I was happy he was alive and not paralyzed.""

Mark Hamill, who is appearing alongside Ford in ""Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,"" poked fun at his co-star's plane crash.

Glad to hear Harrison is doing well. Get well soon. May all his future flights be green-screen!

Ford's son tweeted that his father was ""battered, but ok!""

At the hospital. Dad is ok. Battered, but ok! He is every bit the man you would think he is. He is an incredibly strong man.

Thank you all for your thoughts and good vibes for my dad.

The NTSB will recover the airplane Friday, said Jones.

An avid pilot, Ford told ABC's Barbara Walters in 2008 that he ""loved the freedom of flight.""

""I love the places you go,"" he said. ""I love the people in aviation, the people that I meet in aviation. I love seeing the world from an airplane. I'm in love with flying.""

Ford survived a crash once before. He and a flight instructor crashed a helicopter near Van Nuys Airport in California in 1999, according to The Los Angeles Times.

Ford has worked to support general aviation with the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, and he presented a legacy award in his name to the president of the association in January.

Ford broke his leg on the set of ""Star Wars: Episode VII"" in June 2014 after a door crashed down on it. He had successful surgery following the incident.

Star Wars is produced by Lucasfilm, which is owned by The Walt Disney Co., which also owns ABC News.

The bus was dropping off students at Rancho Santa Margarita Intermediate School this morning when the fire started around 8:15 a.m., according to Steve Concialdi, captain of the Orange County Fire Authority. He called the bus driver a ""hero.""

The school, in Rancho Santa Margarita, said the ""engine of the empty school bus spewed smoke and flames,"" according to its website.

The bus driver, whose name was not disclosed, noticed the engine was on fire, Concialdi said.

There were 35 students on board from the 7th and 8th grade, ages 12 to 14 years.

""[She] did an excellent job of getting all the students off safely. No one was injured. There were three kids who were emotionally distraught, who were treated by paramedics and released back to the school and parents. No one was transported to the hospital,"" Concialdi said.

Rancho Santa Margarita - At 815, a full size yellow bus caught fire in front of RSM Intermediate School. The fire was under control at 8:28

Concialdi, who said the fire started in the engine compartment at the front of the bus, said the incident is under investigation and the bus is now ""a total loss.""

The fire started a small vegetation fire next to the school, so the school followed evacuation procedures, moving 1,325 students to the sports fields. Then school continued in session today.

RSM - The school is located at 21931 Alma Aldea. All the students are safe and no one is injured. The bus driver is a hero."

That’s according to the new Stress In America survey, conducted by Harris Poll for the American Psychological Association.

This news isn’t super shocking—money has been the top stressor since the APA started conducting its annual survey in 2007. But this year’s results show that our money worries could also be harming our health. One in five say they’ve skipped or considered skipping a visit to the doctor when they needed health care in the past year because of financial factors. And almost a third (32%) say that lack of money prevents them from living a healthy lifestyle.

Parents, younger adults (millennials and Gen Xers), and those in lower-income households are especially feeling the strain. Folks with children under 18 at home have higher levels of stress about money than non-parents. While average American stress levels are trending downward, 34% of parents say their overall stress has increased in the past year.

Millennials and Gen Xers are also more stressed about money than older generations. And, not surprisingly, folks with incomes under $50,000 also report greater stress over their finances. Like parents, these groups also say their overall stress levels have gone up in the last year.

Women tend to have higher levels of stress in general, and money stress is no exception: 49% of women say that paying for essentials is a major source of stress, compared with 38% of men. And women are more likely than men to say they feel stress about money all or most of the time.

That said, “Young or old, rich or poor, no group is immune to stress over money,” noted Norman Anderson, PhD, CEO and Executive Vice President of the APA, in a briefing, pointing out that 64% of Americans overall say that money is a significant source of stress in their lives.

Unfortunately, the survey results also show that folks with higher money stress are also more likely to turn to unhealthy ways of coping with their stress, including watching TV for more than two hours a day, surfing the Internet, eating, drinking alcohol, or smoking.

In addition to finding healthy ways to beat stress (including exercise, of course), it’s important to seek out emotional support. “Be proactive,” Anderson said. “To build social relationships, you have to make an effort. Reach out to others—if you’re there for others, they’ll be more likely to be there for you.”"

In video posted online by the Dutch outlet NOS shortly after the incident today, the young man in a suit is shown holding what appears to be a pistol with a silencer attached as he speaks to someone off camera for several minutes in a NOS studio. Eventually, police can be heard entering the room and yelling at the man. He calmly drops the “pistol” and police take him into custody.

Earlier NOS had reported that its newsroom had been evacuated. The man had demanded airtime, the station said. No shots were reportedly fired and later, police told NOS the weapon was a fake."

Indiana Governor Mike Pence signed a ""religious freedom"" bill in private on Thursday that allows businesses to refuse service to gays and lesbians for religious reasons.

Cook tweeted today that he is calling on Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson to veto a similar bill in his state.

Apple is open for everyone. We are deeply disappointed in Indiana's new law and calling on Arkansas Gov. to veto the similar #HB1228.

Around the world, we strive to treat every customer the same — regardless of where they come from, how they worship or who they love.

Supporters of the Indiana law say it prevents the government from compelling people to provide services such as wedding photography for same-sex weddings or other activities they find objectionable on religious grounds.

""This bill is not about discrimination,"" Pence had said, ""and if I thought it legalized discrimination I would have vetoed it.""

Salesforce.com, which bought ExactTarget in Indiana in 2013, is asking other tech companies to respond to Indiana's law. Salesforce.com CEO Marc Benioff was among the CEOs who signed a letter to Gov. Pence on Wednesday.

""We firmly believe in the separation of church and state as provisioned in the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. The [Religious Freedom Restoration Act] clearly blurs that line and opens the door to blatant discrimination,"" Benioff and other CEOs wrote in the letter.

On Thursday, he tweeted that his company, based in San Francisco, is ""canceling all programs that require our customers/employees to travel to Indiana to face discrimination.""

""I hope that in the future the legislatures in the nineteen states that have these laws on the books will reconsider their actions,"" Stoppelman wrote in an open letter to ""states considering imposing discrimination laws."" ""In the meantime, Yelp will make every effort to expand its corporate presence only in states that do not have these laws allowing for discrimination on the books."""

The host of Comedy Central’s ""The Daily Show"" responded Wednesday to the attention brought on by his departure announcement one day earlier.

“Last night I was perusing the Internet, and I guess my question to you is, ‘Did I die?’ Cause it all seems very … ‘I died.’ Very weird. It’s an overwhelming day here, as you can imagine, and people have been asking, I’m not exactly sure what I’m going to do next,” Stewart said during Wednesday’s episode.

Stewart’s surprise announcement drew heavy attention across the entertainment and political worlds, with people reflecting on his impact and speculating about his potential replacement.

“You know what? Working there might be fun,” Stewart said. “I guess my only question as a future employee would be, to work there, would I have to handle, serve, touch, eat or even look at what you so generously describe as food?”

Stewart, 52, began hosting ""The Daily Show"" in 1999. During his tenure, the show and Stewart have won 19 Emmy awards, as well as a Grammy."

On Feb. 1, the Mexican state of Quintana Roo, which includes Cancun, and the popular cruise ports of Cozumel and Playa del Carmen, will switch from Central Standard Time to Eastern Standard Time. The change comes after two years of government and tourism industry efforts.

The change, the Cancun CVB said, ""will mean the destination will gain added sunlight each day, which according to hoteliers and service providers in Cancun, will result in economic benefits, as tourists will enjoy extra time on the beaches, consume more at restaurants and cafes, and spend longer time in parks and excursions found in and around the destination.""

Putting the state in the same time zone as some of it's biggest feeder markets -- including New York, Atlanta and Miami -- could also improve airline connectivity.

“Cancun is excited to welcome this time change, which will allow our visitors to take advantage of one more hour in our beautiful destination,” said Jesus Almaguer, CEO of the Cancun CVB, in a statement. “The added sunlight should also generate reductions in electricity use for hotels and restaurants in the area, which aligns with Cancun’s turquoise conservation initiative.”"

The photo initially was posted by Camfield's granddaughter Sarah Hamm, who was shocked to learn it was being shared by millions across the Internet.

""Grandma was always happy, I mean, she was smart as a whip, even at 101,"" Hamm, 33, told ABC News. ""She was funny and had lots of stories.

""She passed away last night, so this was very bittersweet,"" Hamm added. ""The photo was taken by me of my daughter Kaylee when she was 2 weeks old. It was actually the day she was being released in the hospital, so we were hoping that Grandma would get to meet her.

Hamm of Gilbert, Arizona, posted the photo on St. Patrick's Day of her grandmother and now-3-week-old newborn to share with Facebook friends.Two days later, she was notified that the picture was being circulated around the Web, eventually landing on the page Life of Dad.

""We were in complete shock that the picture took off like it did,"" said the co-founder of the blog, Patrick Quinn. ""When I posted it I thought a few of our fans would feel connected to it as I did. Then, within an hour, it was clear that I had underestimated the impact it would have with people as it was shared and liked hundreds of times per minute.""

Hamm's photo currently has 2.5 million likes and over 77,000 shares on the Life of Dad Facebook page.

In a touching twist, other users began sharing photos of their loved ones, as well, with many of the photos featuring multiple generations.

""Some pictures had five generations of family members in one picture,"" said Quinn. ""One had a woman and her great, great-granddaughter with a 112-year difference to them. The organic response by everyone as a whole was just breathtaking.""

With her grandmother now gone, Hamm said she is pleased with the overwhelming response her photo created.

""I think its really sweet,"" she said. ""I didn’t realize so many people are so much older. The stories people will be able to tell their grandchildren and great-grandchildren is just amazing.""

Camfield was born on June 13, 1913, on Friday the 13th.

She went back to school to become a teacher when she was 43 and lived much of her life in the state of Michigan.

""My grandma would've loved this,"" said Hamm. ""She would probably yell at me for taking a bad picture of her, but no, she would probably say it melts her heart."""
1CIijOu,2015-03-31 00:00:00,5-Year-Old Detroit Shooting Victim Trades an Eye for an 'Aye' in Pirate-Themed Party - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Health/year-detroit-shooting-victim-trades-eye-aye-pirate/story?id=30029222,"Five-year-old Donovan Lyles Jr. was playing video games at his home on Detroit’s east side in January when he was struck by a stray bullet as a result of a random shooting. He went on to lose his eye, but not his spirit.

“When I told him his eye was gone he said he would just have to become a pirate then,” his mother Emily Brazelton told ABC News, adding that the boy never panicked or cried, remaining calm throughout the entire ordeal.

His words touched the hearts of a local theater troupe, Captain Fishbones and the Pirates of the Forgiven.

After one of its members saw his story on the local news, they decided to throw him a pirate themed party.

DJ, as he is known to friends and family was christened “DJ the Daring” at the party, Carole Cross, the troupe’s “purser” told ABC News.

“That’s now his official pirate name,” she said.

The party was held at a local pirate-themed restaurant in nearby St Clair Shores, Michigan. Guests came decked out in swashbuckling costumes complete with eye patches in honor of the boy, Cross said.

Lyles was shy when he first entered the room, his mom said. But once he realized it was a party just for him he couldn’t stop sword fighting and hugging everyone he met. He and his two sisters, Emory and Eternity, were especially thrilled with the gift bags full of “treasures”, Brazelton added.

Her son has always been an upbeat and resilient child, Brazelton said. He became interested in pirates after watching the movie “Pirates of the Caribbean”, she said.

No one has been arrested for the shooting, Brazelton said, and the family moved to a safer neighborhood the day the boy was released from the hospital. She was fired from her job as a grocery cashier shortly after the incident because she was unable to work while caring for her son, she said.

Despite everything, Brazelton said she is thankful for the wonderful party -- and thankful in general.

“That same night a little girl was shot and she didn’t make it,” Brazelton said. “I feel ridiculously grateful that I didn’t lose my baby."""
1CIk5PH,2015-03-31 00:00:00,Virginia Hospital Shooting: Armed Prisoner in Manhunt May Have Switched Cars - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/US/virginia-hospital-shooting-armed-prisoner-manhunt-believed-switched/story?id=30023396,"Police have captured an escaped prisoner who became the subject of a manhunt after fleeing custody at a Virginia hospital this morning, officials said.

The escaped prisoner, Wossen Assaye, was identified by a bus passenger who recognized him on the bus and called police, a law enforcement source told ABC News.

The suspect was arrested in Washington, D.C., by Metropolitan Police Department without incident at 25th and Pennsylvania Avenue SE, law enforcement sources added.

Assaye earlier prompted a lockdown at Inova Fairfax Hospital, in Falls Church, Virginia, less than 10 miles southwest of Washington, D.C., authorities said.

Assaye had been taken to the hospital for injuries sustained during a suicide attempt last Friday, officials said. For the first 24 hours of his hospital treatment, he was watched by Alexandria County sheriff’s deputies, and after that, responsibility for security went to security contractor Allied Protective Services.

At 3 a.m. this morning, Assaye overpowered a female security guard at the hospital and took her gun, Fairfax County Police Chief Edwin Roessler said today after Assaye was captured.

Next, Assaye confronted a male security officer, according to Bobby Mathieson of the U.S. Marshals Service. Mathieson said the male officer fired a shot but no one was hit -- though Roessler said it was unknown who fired the shot.

Assaye then escaped through a hospital stairwell, officials said. Authorities say they don't know what restraints were on him. He was wearing a hospital gown and no shoes at the time.

Police are looking for this escaped prisoner. He is wearing a hospital gown and no shoes & armed with a gun. pic.twitter.com/sMtvEYkWeL

Authorities said they did not know if the escape was pre-planned.

Assaye fled to a residential neighborhood and broke into the trunk of a 2002 silver Toyota Camry, authorities said. When the owner of the car started to drive to work, Assaye kicked his way out of the trunk and carjacked the vehicle, police said.

The driver was slightly injured during the carjacking, police said.

Around 10:30 a.m., the Camry was found abandoned. Assaye then carjacked another car and fled, police said.

The second car, a 2008 Hyundai Elantra, has also been located, police said after Assaye's capture.

Police said a weapon has been recovered.

Suspect abandoned the first stolen vehicle and has stolen a second one. We are now looking for a dark gray Hyundai Elantra w/VA: XTU-5024

A heavy police presence was reported near the hospital, and police vehicles were seen blocking the hospital’s entrances during the search for the prisoner. Hospital employees were being sent to a nearby high school, and a shuttle bus was carrying the employees to work during the lockdown, police said.

Assaye made his initial appearance in a federal courtroom in Alexandria, Virginia, this afternoon. He was charged with one count of escape from custody in addition to the charge he is already facing for armed robbery.

Assaye appeared ""heavily shackled"" and escorted by four deputy U.S. marshals, a law enforcement source said.

His next appearance will be Friday afternoon.

According to a court complaint, Assaye was accused in a string of bank robberies in eastern Virginia between October 2013 and March 20, 2015. In each situation, authorities say, the perpetrator entered the bank -- often with a cell phone to his ear -- either displayed a handgun or demand note, and verbally demanded money.

Assaye had a criminal history, with convictions for multiple burglary and robbery offenses in 1998 and 1999, and served time in prison between 2000 and May 2013, according to the complaint.

1CikxCQ,2015-03-27 00:00:00,Germanwings Crash: How Often Pilots Commit 'Aircraft-Assisted Suicide' - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Health/germanwings-crash-pilots-commit-aircraft-assisted-suicide/story?id=29932202,"Although authorities said the co-pilot of the Germanwings flight that crashed earlier this week in France intended to “destroy the plane” with 150 people on board, so-called “aircraft-assisted suicides” are rare, according to researchers who reviewed decades of crash data. Still, they’ve occurred in the past, and sometimes, the pilots expressed their intentions beforehand, according to their study.

Of the 7,244 fatal airplane crashes in the United States from 1993 through 2012, 24 were the result of aircraft-assisted suicide, the authors concluded in the 2014 study published in the journal ""Aviation, Space and Environmental Medicine.""

But the study's lead author, Dr. Alpo Vuorio of the Mehilainen Airport Health Centre in Finland, said their findings show a need for greater transparency by the pilots’ when it comes to self-reporting their psychological conditions. He said five of the eight pilots involved in aircraft-assisted suicides in the United States from 2003 through 2012 somehow voiced their suicidal thoughts beforehand, investigators uncovered after the crashes. Yet those suicidal thoughts were not disclosed to aviation doctors or the airlines by the pilots or those who knew of their suicidal thoughts.

""Somebody knew,"" Vuorio said. ""They’re [crash investigators] not saying the aviation doctor knew. That information was there, but it wasn't spoken about and that's sad.”

The Federal Aviation Administration requires pilots to undergo medical evaluations at least once a year, but Seattle-based aviation analyst Todd Curtis, said psychological conditions are mostly self-reported.

""If you self-identify that you have certain things wrong with you, you can be denied license,"" he said. ""If you can pass a medical exam where there's very little vetting of information outside the exam, sure, you can fly.""

Until five years ago, U.S. pilots weren't allowed to take most antidepressants. Today, most psychological conditions require an FAA decision before pilots can be allowed to fly, according to the administration's guide for aviation medical examiners. Conditions including psychosis, bipolar disorder and a prior suicide attempt are grounds for denying or deferring a pilot’s license. It’s up to the FAA to make a final decision.

The FAA was not immediately available for comment.

In Europe, pilots ""may"" be required to undergo psych evaluations and those with ""schizotypal or delusional"" disorders will not be allowed to fly, according to published guidelines.

Notable suspected aircraft-assisted suicides involved commercial flights such as Silk Air Flight MI 185 in 1997 and LAM Mozambique Airlines Flight 470 in 2013. And according to Curtis, who founded AirSafe.com in the mid-1990s in order to track airplane accidents, there are others that officials determined to have been sabotaged by pilots or are suspected of having been downed by their pilots.

In 1982, a Japan Air Lines pilot reportedly ""lost his senses"" and crashed a plane carrying 150 people into Tokyo Bay, killing 24 of them but not the pilot, according to the New York Times. There was reportedly a fight in the cockpit before the plane went down.

In 1997, all 104 people aboard Silk Air flight MI 185 died when the flight went down in Indonesia. Contradicting findings by Indonesian authorities, which ruled out a suicide, U.S. investigators determined that the crash was intentional.

""The accident can be explained by intentional pilot action,"" they said in a letter to Indonesian investigators in 2000. ""The evidence suggests that the cockpit voice recorder was intentionally disconnected.""

Egypt Air Flight 990 went down near Nantucket, Massachusetts, in 1999, killing all 217 people on board, ABC News reported at the time. Investigators concluded that there was nothing wrong with the plane itself -- as EgyptAir suggested -- and wondered whether the crash was intentional.

The NTSB led this investigation and wrote in its final report, ""The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of the EgyptAir flight 990 accident is the airplane's departure from normal cruise flight and subsequent impact with the Atlantic Ocean as a result of the relief first officer's flight control inputs. The reason for the relief first officer's actions was not determined.

All 33 people aboard LAM Mozambique Airlines flight 470 died in 2013 after the pilot put the plane into a ""dangerously steep dive, seemingly on purpose"" in Namibia, according to Vuorio's study.

The accident remains under investigation.

Malaysia Air flight 370 disappeared last March carrying 277 passengers and 12 crew members. About an hour into the flight from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia to Beijing, air traffic controllers lost contact with it, and investigators believe it flew thousands of miles off-course.

Despite more than a year of searching, the plane has not been found.

It all started when Birmingham mom Kyesha Smith Wood sent her son, daughter and step-daughter to see Cinderella at the local movie theater.

""There were two girls behind us, they were giggling, kind of talking ... kicking my seat,"" Rebecca Boyd, of Adger, Alabama, recalled to ABC News.

""I turned around and I said, 'You know girls, we paid for this movie just like you did. Could you guys keep it down?' They just laughed,"" Boyd said. ""After I spoke to them, they seemed to not care. They just laughed in my face.""

Wood said her son told her what happened.

""That broke my heart,"" Wood told ABC News. ""It really made me feel a lot of shame and I felt embarrassed for the girls' behavior.""

Wood posted the story on her Facebook page, asking the moviegoer to contact her.

""The woman I'm looking for addressed them and asked them to be quiet and they were disrespectful,"" Wood wrote on Facebook. ""After the movie she approached my girls and told them that her husband had been laid off and this was the last movie she would be able to take her daughter to for a while and my girls ruined that for her.""

Wood's post continued, ""This rude, disrespectful, and awful behavior is unacceptable and they owe you an apology.""

The local Jefferson County Sheriff's Office then shared Wood's post on Facebook. The story went viral, generating over 250,000 likes.

""I live in that community,"" Sgt. Jack Self told ABC News. ""I just felt like if I could put it for a bigger audience, maybe she could find the lady she was looking for.""

Boyd's identity was revealed when she left a comment on the sheriff's office post, and on Monday, the moms finally came together in person.

""I was shocked that the mother supported me,"" Boyd told ABC News.

Wood's daughters wrote an apology letter to Boyd and also contributed some of their allowance towards the Boyd family's next trip to the movies.

""I believe they’re good girls,"" Boyd said. ""They just made some mistakes.”

""Rebecca is really the hero in this,"" Wood said. ""Initially none of this would have happened if Rebecca had not said something to the girls.""

""I think more parents have to do that,"" Wood added.

Wood said, ""the intention was never to embarrass or humiliate the girls, but at the same time, I think they kind of understand the power of social media and how quickly the things you do wrong can spread."""

None of the 10 people are sick, the CDC said today, but they all had contact with an American who tested positive for Ebola and was admitted to the National Institutes of Health earlier this week.

""As a result of CDC's ongoing investigation, CDC and the State Department are facilitating the return of additional American citizens who had potential exposure to the index patient or exposures similar to those that resulted in the infection of the index patient. Currently, none of these individuals have been identified as having Ebola virus disease,"" the CDC said in a statement.

The Americans will not travel commercially and will be near the University of Nebraska Medical Center, the National Institutes of Health or Emory University Hospital, the CDC added. Four of the 10 patients will be quarantined at Nebraska's hospital for observation, Nebraska Medicine said.

Earlier this week, a U.S. worker tested positive for Ebola and was admitted to the NIH Clinical Center Special Clinical Studies Unit in Maryland.

On Friday, another worker was transported near Emory to be monitored."
1CiwckZ,2015-03-27 00:00:00,"NYC Building Fire: Restaurant Owner Smelled Gas Before Massive Explosion, Officials Say - ABC News",http://abcnews.go.com/US/mayor-de-blasio-east-village-fire-remains-investigation/story?id=29956875,"With the cause of a fire and explosion that destroyed several buildings in Manhattan's East Village on Thursday still under investigation, officials today began to stitch together details of events that preceded the blast.

The explosion reportedly occurred after the building's owner and a contractor arrived to investigate the smell of gas reported by a restaurant owner in one of the buildings, police said, following a gas company inspection of a contractor's work in a basement nearby.

In all, three buildings collapsed and a fourth building was seriously damaged, New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio said, adding that the fire department is still actively fighting the fire. Though ""the strong assumption is a gas explosion"" was the cause, no final conclusion has been drawn, he added.

""There is a possibility here that the gas line was inappropriately accessed internally by people in the building,"" DeBlasio said. ""We don't know enough yet, though, about the details of that.""

DeBlasio said investigators may not be able to determine any more until they clear the debris and access one of the destroyed buildings.

""There's certainly a possibility of impropriety, but until we access the site we cannot get the next step,"" he said. ""Until we get into that basement and get the full picture, we will not be able to confirm [the explosion's cause].""

Twenty-two people were injured, four critically, De Blasio said today. No fatalities have been reported, but two people remain unaccounted for.

Two of the most seriously injured victims were Michael Hrynenko, a building co-owner, and Dilber Kukic, a general contractor working at the site who helped carry Hrynenko away from the blast, police said. Both were being treated at New York Presbyterian Hospital's burn unit.

The two men had earlier figured in events leading up to the blast, according to authorities.

Inspectors from the local power and gas company, Con Ed, arrived at the building at 2 p.m. Thursday to meet with the contractor to evaluate work being done by a plumber in the basement of one of the buildings, according to police. The work failed inspection.

After the inspectors left, the owner of the Sushi Park restaurant, located in one of the buildings, notified a building owner, Maria Hrynenko, mother of Michael Hrynenko, of a gas odor, according to police. Michael Hrynenko and Kukic met up at the location to investigate, and when they opened the side door of 119 Second Avenue, also known as 45 East 7th Street, there was an explosion, officials said.

Officials said Kukic was answering questions and helping with the investigation.

The Department of Buildings will be inspecting all of the surrounding buildings before they are re-inhabited, the mayor said.

The gas is shut off for the immediate surrounding area and air quality has returned to normal levels in the surrounding area.

""Once the debris is cleared and the fire is fully extinguished then we will do a full investigation and clean-up,"" De Blasio said, adding that the full investigation will ""take days.""

He noted repeatedly that people who detect the smell of gas should not investigate it themselves, but call the proper authorities immediately.

""It could have happened in any building,"" the mayor said. ""The important thing is for people to call 911 or Con Ed.""

1CjGVxg,2015-03-17 00:00:00,"Hillary Clinton's Deleted Emails Were Individually Reviewed After All, Spokesman Says - ABC News",http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/hillary-clintons-deleted-emails-individually-reviewed-spokesman/story?id=29654638,"How exactly did Hillary Clinton's team decide which of her emails should be saved and which ones should be deleted?

Three days after Time Magazine initially reported on Team Clinton’s review process to determine which of her emails were work-related and which were personal, the former secretary of state's people are now saying the examination did include opening and reading each email.

They did not confirm or deny Time's reporting for three days, with no explanation for why it took so long to clarify their deletion process.

Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill has released a statement saying that “in wanting the public to understand how robust of a search was conducted, the fact sheet laid out several examples of the methods used by the reviewers to double and triple check they were capturing everything.""

The “fact sheet” refers to a question-and-answer document given out after the news conference last week.

The statement continues: ""It was not meant to be taken as a list of every approach performed to ensure thoroughness. Those subsequent steps were in addition to reading them all, not in lieu of reading them all. (No different than our explaining such terms were used but not listing every search term used.) We simply took for granted that reading every single email came across as the most important, fundamental and exhaustive step that was performed. The fact sheet should have been clearer every email was read, which we are doing now.”

The big headline from Clinton’s news conference Tuesday was that, although she claims to have turned over all work-related emails, she deleted the rest of her emails and it appears they are gone forever.

A Time magazine cover story about the email scandal released last week reported: ""This review did not involve opening and reading each email. Instead, Clinton’s lawyers created a list of names and keywords related to her work and searched for those. Slightly more than half the total cache -- 31,830 emails -- did not contain any of the search terms, according to Clinton’s staff, so they were deemed to be 'private, personal records.'”
Clinton's team is now saying this is not true.

Time didn't disclose how it determined that each email wasn't opened individually, but says it seemed to be consistent with a written explanation provided by Clinton's spokesman after the news conference this week.
During the news conference, Clinton did not go into the details of how the review was conducted, but said it was “thorough” and that she went “above and beyond” what she was required to do in turning over many of her emails to the State Department.

""We went through a thorough process to identify all of my work-related emails and deliver them to the State Department,"" she said, adding that all other emails were personal and pertained to matters such as ""yoga routines,"" ""family vacations,"" and ""planning Chelsea's wedding.""

But later, after the news conference, Clinton’s team distributed a lengthy question-and-answer document that detailed the “multi-step” process. The process appeared to have included an extensive, nuanced search of Clinton’s inbox, but the document did not make clear how many of the emails were opened and read in the review.

Today, however, Clinton's team said that all the emails were opened and read.

According to that document from the earlier news conference, here is a summary of how Clinton’s attorneys, whom she tasked with the job, said they sorted through, but it specifically did not say each e mail was read.
• First, a search was done of all emails Clinton received from a .gov or state.gov account during the period she was secretary of state -- from 2009 to 2013.
• Then, with the remaining emails, a search was done for names of 100 State Department and other U.S. government officials who Clinton may have had correspondence with during her tenure.
• Next, the emails were organized and reviewed by sender and recipient to “account for non-obvious or non-recognizable email addresses or misspellings or other idiosyncrasies.”
• Lastly, of the emails still left over, a ""number of terms"" were searched, including “Benghazi” and “Libya.”

The results of the searching were that Clinton’s attorneys found 30,490 work-related emails and 31,830 emails that were deemed “private and personal.”

Clinton said on Tuesday she deleted all of the personal emails because she thought she “had no reason to save them.”

The revelation has only raised more questions among Clinton’s detractors about what was in those emails and why she used the private account in the first place.

On Sunday, ABC News’ Jon Karl reported House Speaker John Boehner is expected to announce this week a new investigation into Clinton's email practices as Secretary of State, according to top House Republicans.

Meanwhile, Clinton is hoping to move past her email issues as she prepares for a more-than-likely presidential campaign that she is expected to announce next month.

1CJUHHB,2015-02-18 00:00:00,'Road Rage' Shooting: The Adjusted Timeline - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/US/tammy-meyers-road-rage-shooting-adjusted-timeline/story?id=29046012,"As Las Vegas police work to identify a suspect in the apparent “road rage” shooting that left a mother of four dead, authorities are also struggling to draw an accurate picture of what happened.

The adjusted timeline of events is largely based on the accounts of the daughter and son who were in the car with the victim, 44-year-old Tammy Meyers, according to Lt. Ray Steiber of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department

""What I think everybody wants is an accurate timeline and an accurate depiction of what occurred,"" Steiber said at a news conference Tuesday.

Here is what we know so far:

Thursday, Feb. 12: Police now believe that after Meyers and her 15-year-old daughter finished a driving lesson in a school parking lot, Meyers drove home. When a car pulled up aggressively behind Meyers and tried to pass, Meyers' daughter reached over and honked the horn, police say.

“Meyers sped past the male, and she continued on her way,” Steiber said. ""Mrs. Meyers is scared, she’s upset.”

Meyers drove home and asked her daughter to tell her son, 22-year-old Brandon Meyers, who was armed, to come out to the car, Steiber said. Tammy and Brandon Meyers went looking for the ""road rage"" suspect and found him, before losing track of him again, Steiber said.

When the mother and son returned home, Steiber said, the suspect's car pulled up. Gunfire erupted and Meyers was fatally wounded.

""All indications ... are that this unknown person had fired shots first,"" Steiber said, adding that the son returned fire.

Saturday, Feb. 14: Meyers died at the University Medical Center of Southern Nevada.

Steiber said the homicide division then took over the case from the violent crimes section.

Tuesday, Feb. 17: A candlelight vigil was held outside Walter Johnson Junior High School, where Meyers had been giving her daughter the driving lesson the night of the shooting.

The daughter said at the vigil, ""I was in the car with her. There's so much I can say about my mom. My mom was protecting me that night and she was doing what any mom would do. She was my everything, my best friend. She did everything she could possibly do to protect me and I love her so much.""

Brandon Meyers said at the vigil, ""I did what I had to do to protect my family. And I'd do it for anyone I love.”

The suspect, who has not been identified, was described by police as a white male, about 25 years old, who stands at 6 feet tall and weighs 180 pounds. He has ""dirty blonde hair worn in a spiked style and has hazel or blue eyes,"" police have said. The suspect's car is described as a four-door silver or grey sedan.

Police are still reviewing the timeline and other aspects of the case.

Watchstanders were notified at 12:35 a.m. Monday that the Canadian tall ship's engines were disabled and its sails were wrapped around the mast, according to a statement from the Coast Guard.

""It was fortunate for the crew of the vessel that the owner reached out to us,"" said Jay Woodhead, the command duty officer at Sector Boston's Command Center.

He added that with wind gusts up to 30 knots, it was unsafe for them to stay aboard.

As the weather ""deteriorated"" and seas reached nearly 10 feet, two motor lifeboat crews went 58 miles east from the coast to try to tow the vessel back to Gloucester, but once on scene, ""rough sea conditions caused the tow line to break,"" the Coast Guard said.

Coast Guard members then helped the stranded crew members gets into immersion suits and abandon ship along with the assistance of a helicopter crew.

One man suffered a head injury while leaping from Liana's Ransom and airlifted by helicopter to Massachusetts General Hospital.

The rest of the men were then transferred to lifeboats, which returned to the station.

A locator beacon was left on Liana's Ransom still at sea for tracking, and it was last reported the Coast Guard was en-route to evaluate towing the ship to port."

Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri does not regret signing the open letter to Iran’s leaders warning of the limits of a nuclear deal with the Obama administration, unlike some of his Republican Senate colleagues.

“I really don’t,” Blunt told ABC’s George Stephanopoulos on “This Week” today when asked whether he had any second thoughts on the letter.

2. Video Shows Moment Freight Train Collided With Car in Fatal Kentucky Crash

At least two people died and two others were injured in Kentucky when their car entered a train crossing into the path of an oncoming freight train, police said.

The crash, which was captured on video, happened at 4:07 p.m. Saturday in Louisville.

Dwight Mitchell of the Louisville Metro Police said the intersection’s flashing lights and sounds were activated to alert drivers of the approaching train. There is no gate at the intersection.

3. Why Taking Over the 'Daily Show' Would Be Hard, Even for 'Egypt's Jon Stewart'

He’s the megastar you might not have heard of: Bassem Youssef is known as “The Jon Stewart of Egypt,” a wildly popular Egyptian political satirist.

Youssef was the face of the groundbreaking show “Al Bernameg,” averaging an audience of 40 million viewers each week and becoming the most-watched show in the history of Egyptian TV.

Could this irreverent Middle Easterner be in line to host “The Daily Show” on Comedy Central? Youssef eschewed the idea, telling ABC News’ David Wright Stewart will leave “huge shoes to fill,” and joking that it would be “the worst rebound ever, like a bad rebound boyfriend for the show.”

4. Watch an Eagle Soar From the World's Tallest Building

Talk about a bird's-eye view. A conservation group released this video Saturday after it attached a tiny video camera to the back of Darshan, an eagle that took off from the top of Dubai's Burj Khalifa, the world's tallest tower.

The bird soared some 2,700 feet, providing amazing views of the United Arab Emirates city.

5. Bristol Palin Engaged to Medal of Honor Recipient Dakota Meyer

Bristol Palin and Medal of Honor recipient Sgt. Dakota Meyer are engaged, a Palin family friend confirmed.

The daughter of former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin posted a photo with her new fiance on Instagram, writing, ""Truly the luckiest girl in the world, cannot wait to marry this man!!!!"""
1CkIrzb,2015-03-16 00:00:00,The 4 Most Confusing Things About Sugar - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Health/confusing-things-sugar/story?id=29625570,"Nowadays, when people meet me and hear that I'm a dietitian, the first thing they want to know is: What's the deal with sugar? No doubt, sugar is the diet villain du jour. You've probably seen some scary headlines calling sugar toxic and pointing to it as the source of all our health woes. But the real story is far more complex.

Sugar in large quantities is, in fact, a big threat to your health. For years, experts have been saying that eating too much of any food can up your diabetes risk because overeating leads to obesity, which is the real culprit behind skyrocketing rates of the disease. But recent research suggests that the sweet stuff may have a more direct impact: For every additional 150 calories of added sugar downed per person per day, the prevalence of diabetes rose by 1 percent, even after controlling for obesity, physical activity and calories from other foods, according to a large study looking at international data. When it comes to heart health, excess sugar is also suspect. People who ate the most added sugar more than doubled their risk of death from heart disease, a JAMA Internal Medicine study found.

Adding to the problem, sugar is hiding in many surprising products, such as oatmeal and peanut butter, and confusing food labels make it hard to know how much of it you're getting. So what's a girl to do?

10 Easy Ways to Slash Sugar from Your Diet

Before you swear off everything from ice cream to strawberries, read my ground rules to satisfying your sweet tooth in the safest way possible.

It's key to know the difference between the two main types of sugar.

Naturally occurring sugar is found in whole foods, such as fruit, vegetables and dairy products. These foods tend to be better for you because they deliver fiber (in the case of produce), as well as protein and calcium (in dairy) and other important vitamins and minerals.

Added sugars are anything sweet put into a food for flavor, from the sugar in store-bought ketchup to the honey you spoon into your tea. (Yes, ""natural"" sweeteners count.) These sugars are concentrated and mostly devoid of nutrients. Although honey, maple syrup and the like have some healthful antioxidants and minerals, they still pack hefty doses of sweetener per spoonful. This means you get a lot of pure sugar—and calories—in a small portion, making it easy to go overboard and cause big problems. According to the American Heart Association (AHA), increases in sugar intake over the past four decades parallel our expanding waistlines, and studies have connected added sugar, not the naturally occurring kind, to heart disease and diabetes.

10 Coffee Drinks Worse Than a Candy Bar

A lot of packaged foods contain both naturally occurring and added sugars. But the Nutrition Facts label lumps both kinds together, giving you one combined total. Last year, the FDA proposed separating the two to make it clearer how much of each type you're getting, but until those changes take effect, the easiest way to tell if sugar has been added is to scan the actual ingredients list. If you see sugar grams but no sweeteners listed, then none were added. If you do see any type of sweetener—including brown sugar, cane juice, corn syrup, maltose or fructose—make sure it's not the first thing listed. By law, ingredients must be in descending order of weight, so the higher up the added sugar, the more there is per bite. Also check for multiple types of sugar, which is a sneaky way food companies make something supersweet without telegraphing it on the ingredients list.

16 Most Misleading Food Labels

But you can automatically slash your sugar load by ditching sweetened drinks, eating mostly whole foods instead of sugary snacks and buying more unsweetened versions of packaged foods.

According to the AHA, women should have no more than 100 calories of added sugar per day (about 6 teaspoons). Yet the average woman gets 18 teaspoons a day! Most of our added sugar comes from sweetened drinks and packaged foods, and the Nutrition Facts label lists sugar in grams, not calories or teaspoons, so it's easy to lose track. Fortunately, there's a simple formula for counting up sugar from any source: Just remember that 1 teaspoon equals about 4 grams of added sugar. So if you add a teaspoon to your morning joe and later have a chocolate protein bar with 12 grams (3 teaspoons) of sugar, you have 2 teaspoons (8 grams) left for the day.

Hardly any of us are inhaling too many servings of whole fruits and vegetables. But juices, smoothies and dried fruits are another story. Recently, a client was confused when I pointed out that her 15-ounce bottle of green juice contained more than 53 grams of sugar (and nearly 270 calories!). It's all fruits and veggies, she reasoned, so why care? One problem when you gulp your produce is that you're getting natural sugar without fiber (and it's fiber in fruit that slows down digestion and gives your body time to metabolize the sugar). As a result, you store the excess calories as fat. Fiber also prevents blood sugar spikes that can raise your risk of type 2 diabetes.

Dried fruit can be tricky, too; without water, the natural sugars become more concentrated. You can still enjoy it, but right-size your portion: One cup of fresh fruit equals 1/2 cup of 100 percent juice equals 1/4 cup of unsweetened dried fruit. Now you're in control of your sugar calories.

The procedure, laparoscopic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, was motivated by a family history of ovarian cancer. A small benign tumor was found on one ovary, but no other signs of cancer were uncovered, she wrote.

“Regardless of the hormone replacements I’m taking, I am now in menopause,” she wrote. “I will not be able to have any more children, and I expect some physical changes. But I feel at ease with whatever will come, not because I am strong but because this is a part of life. It is nothing to be feared.”

Previously, Jolie underwent preventative double mastectomy after a blood test showed a mutation in the BRCA1 gene.

In her op-ed, titled “Diary of a Surgery,” Jolie, 39, stated that tests showed elevated risks for cancer, forcing her to move up the surgery.

“I went through what I imagine thousands of other women have felt. I told myself to stay calm, to be strong, and that I had no reason to think I wouldn’t live to see my children grow up and to meet my grandchildren,” she wrote.

As a result of her surgery, Jolie received a progesterone IUD, which will help maintain hormonal balance – and prevent uterine cancer, she wrote.

Jolie and husband Brad Pitt have three biological children and three adopted children together."

Diane Foley, whose son James Foley was shown in an Aug. 19 ISIS video being killed by the group's spokesman ""Jihad John,"" has spoken out before -- but Mueller's possible fate renewed her ire over what she feels was the government's inattention to the crisis.

""Kayla, along with our son and others were held for nearly two years and there were many opportunities along the way: several times when the captors reached out, several times when returning hostages brought sensitive information. And yet nothing was done to save our young Americans. So that's the part that deeply concerns me,"" Foley told ABC News in an interview, parts of which aired on ""World News Tonight.""

While Jordan did conduct airstrikes in Raqqa, ISIS has offered no evidence yet of her death, much less on that date or in a coalition bombing run.

Many counter-terrorism officials focused on ISIS remain deeply skeptical, while the Muellers in seclusion have signaled they do not know whether they should accept their daughter's death or not.

For much of 2013 and 2014, Diane Foley and hostage negotiators working for her family knew the likely locations of the western captives held by ISIS in Syria, even as they were moved from time to time. But the U.S. didn't launch a mission until July 3, when a squadron of operators from the elite Delta Force hit an oil refinery site near Raqqa, discovering it was a ""dry hole.""

Kayla Mueller had been among those held there, counter-terrorism sources have told ABC News.

""I certainly applaud the young, courageous soldiers who went on that mission. It was much too late and the intelligence obviously was poor -- it wasn't good enough for those courageous soldiers -- so they went in for nothing,"" Foley said.

A counter-terrorism official with knowledge of the planning and execution of the July 3 rescue operation said Diane Foley's assessment was correct.

""Washington took too long. We missed the hostages by two days. We could have had all the hostages -- all of them,"" the counter-terrorism official told ABC News last week, still upset over the outcome.

Since then, three American, two British, two Japanese and a Jordanian hostage have been executed in gruesome ISIS videos.

A spokesman for the National Security Council declined to address Foley's criticism directly but said the White House is conducting a review due this spring ordered by President Obama of the government's hostage policy, which generally falls under classified portions of National Security Presidential Directive-12."

Dozens of friends and family came dressed in costumes of their favorite comic book characters, Chris' wife, Jackie Kmetz, told ABC News today.

Jackie dressed up as Wonder Woman while her kids dressed up as a little Superboy and Supergirl. Even villains like Poison Ivy from ""Batman"" and characters from other fandoms like ""Star Wars"" came out to celebrate, Jackie said.

""We wanted to have a fun, kid-friendly celebration for my two little ones to remember their dad,"" Jackie said of her two children, ages 2 and 4. ""I was so thrilled. It was the exact kind of party he would have loved.""

Chris, 41, died last month after a car accident, leaving behind two kids but saving two lives through organs he donated just hours after his death, his wife said.

""In true superhero fashion, Chris passed away, but he saved two lives after donating his kidneys,"" Jackie told ABC News last month.

Jackie tried to include everything Chris loved in the celebration of his life, she said.

The auditorium was decorated with Superman-colored balloons. There was even a popcorn machine, a cotton candy machine and a video game corner with car racing games.

""The place was a good representation of what my husband was all about,"" Jackie said. ""It was so much fun and there were lots smiles and laughter just as Chris would've wanted.""

A few tears were shed, however, during a slideshow presentation remembering Chris' life, Jackie said.

""There were all these pictures of him being goofy, and you could just see how he was our family's hero,"" Jackie said. ""After the slideshow, we had an open mic where lots of family and friends shared good memories of Chris.""

Guests also record a message to Jackie's kids in a ""video interview corner"" Jackie set up, she said.

""I'm not sure how much they understand now given their young age, but when they're older, they can watch these videos and learn more about their amazing dad from everyone he touched,"" Jackie said."

The explosion took place just outside the separatist stronghold inside a chemical plant.

In spite of the size of the fireball that was caught on video, no casualties were immediately reported.

The explosion happened when a Ukrainian artillery shell hit the chemical factory, according to reports from the Donetsk News Agency, which The Associated Press characterized as a mouthpiece for the rebel troops.

The incident comes amid heightened tensions in the region that has seen fighting for the past year as the Russian government has underhandedly supported the rebels in an effort to gain control of the country.

More than 5,300 people have died since the fighting began last February."

A Spanish soldier serving with the United Nations along the border inside Lebanese territory was also killed.

It’s the most serious escalation on this border in years, the attack taking place in the contested area called Shebaa Farms, or Mount Dov, as it’s called in Israel in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. Both Syria and Lebanon lay claim to that portion of land along the border.

Shortly after the attack Wednesday morning, the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah officially claimed responsibility, saying it was carried out by the “heroic martyrs of Quneitra” brigade, a reference to the six Hezbollah fighters and Iranian general killed by a suspected Israeli strike in Quneitra, Syria, on Jan. 18.

Israel was expecting a response by Hezbollah, but as with any conflict in the region, there are fears that it could escalate into an all-out conflict.

Speaking on a conference call with international journalists on Wednesday, Israel Ziv, an Israeli reserve major general and former head of the army’s operations, described the situation in the north as a ""very tricky and, I would say, flammable situation.”

“Israel has to contain it, to defend our interests, but not get drawn in” to those northern battlefields, Ziv said.
Roughly an hour after Wednesday's initial attack, mortar shells landed near Mount Hermon in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights and the IDF evacuated civilians from the area. In a statement, the IDF confirmed that it retaliated by air and land against “Hezbollah operational positions.""

“We have responded to Hezbollah’s escalation,” IDF spokesman Peter Lerner tweeted. He added later, “we reserve the right to respond further against Hezbollah.”

We have responded to #Hezbollah's escalation, #IDF will continue ro operate in order to safeguard #Israel

The United Nations and the Spanish embassy in Beirut confirmed to ABC News that a Spanish soldier for the U.N.'s monitoring body UNIFIL was killed during the shelling while at his post along the border. A Spanish medical team that rushed to the post from a nearby base was unable to save him, an embassy official said.

The prime minister of Spain tweeted his condolences.

Mi más profundo pesar por el fallecimiento del militar español en #Líbano. Mi afecto y condolencias a su familia y compañeros. MR

Wednesday's fighting came after two rockets fired from Syria landed in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights on Tuesday. They landed in open areas and didn't hurt anyone but Israel quickly responded by firing artillery into Syria. Just before midnight, Israel struck again, hitting Syrian Army artillery positions, the IDF said.

After Wednesday's attack, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rushed to Tel Aviv from southern Israel for an emergency security meeting.

“We will not allow terror elements to disrupt the lives of our citizens and threaten their security,"" he tweeted. ""We will know how to respond with force to whoever challenges us.”

Speaking earlier Wednesday at an event in the southern city of Sderot, Israel, Netanyahu struck a similar tone.

""To anyone who is trying to challenge us on the northern border, I suggest looking at what happened here, not far from the city of Sderot, in the Gaza Strip,” he said. ""Hamas was dealt its heaviest blow ever since its founding, and the Israel Defense Forces is prepared to act forcefully in all areas.”

Researchers at University of Washington and a nonprofit called Group Health followed 3,434 adults over age 65 for more than seven years. None of them had dementia or Alzheimer's disease when the study started, and they kept careful records about the drugs they took. The researchers found that people who took more anticholinergic drugs -- which affect the nervous system and are in antihistamines and some bladder control medications -- were more likely to develop dementia.

The link has been studied before but this is an especially good study, said Dr. James Leverenz, a neurologist who directs the Cleveland Center for Brain Health at the Cleveland Clinic and was not party of the new study.

""People want to be very careful about what kind of medicines they taking or if they already have some issues with their thinking skills,"" Leverenz said. ""I knew when I first start taking [antihistamines] for allergies, I feel a little clouded and sleepy. Some of that is the anticholinergic effect in the brain.""

Still, he stressed the researchers only found an association between the drugs and dementia and did not determine whether the drugs caused dementia. More research is needed, he said, adding that some antihistamine products have fewer effects on the cholinergic system of the brain, which is involved in thinking skills and memory. He said this link between dementia and these drugs has not been studied in younger adults.

""Consult with your primary clinician if you have questions,"" he said. ""Carefully read the contents of medications you take over the counter."""

The coaster stalled as it was going up, the New York Police Department said. Passengers were then evacuated safely, according to a Luna Park official.

No injuries were reported according to the NYPD and Luna Park. Ten to 12 people were on the ride at the time, Luna Park said.

Today was Luna Park's opening day of the season. The Cyclone got stuck on its second ride, according to Angie Morris, brand manager for Luna Park.

""Safety is the number one priority for our guests at Luna Park. This was an isolated issue and it is quickly being resolved,"" Morris said in a statement.

The ride will reopen ""after proper inspection,"" the statement added."
1CNNiZs,2015-04-01 00:00:00,"Detective Seen on Video Berating Uber Driver to Be Transferred, NYPD Commissioner Says - ABC News",http://abcnews.go.com/US/detective-video-berating-uber-driver-internal-affairs-review/story?id=30045512,"A video showing a police detective berating an Uber driver in New York City has gone viral, and the NYPD said the video is under review by the Internal Affairs Bureau and that it will also be investigated by the Civilian Complaint Review Board.

The officer in the video, identified as NYPD Detective Patrick Cherry, will be transferred out of his post with the Joint Terrorism Task Force, Police Commissioner William Bratton said today.

Bratton also offered an apology to the Uber driver and the passengers for the detective's actions during the encounter. ""Anger like that is unacceptable in any encounter. Discourtesy like that and language like that is unacceptable. That officer's behavior reflected poorly on everyone who wears our uniform,"" Bratton said.

In the video, the detective stands at the driver's door, shouting, ""Do you understand me? I don't know what [expletive] planet you think you're on right now.""

Sanjay Seth confirmed to ABC News that he was a passenger in the car when the incident occurred on the West Side Highway, and that he took the video with his cellphone.

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said earlier, ""There’s just no place for any public servant to use discriminatory or negative language.""

The driver remains calm in the video and does not raise his voice to the detective. At one point, the detective slams the driver's door closed.

The incident began when the Uber driver honked at the detective's car after the detective was apparently trying to park without using his blinker, Seth said, and the Uber driver wanted to make it through the green light.

When the detective walks away for a moment after berating the driver, the passenger who is videotaping says, ""That's crazy. That's really inappropriate.""

Another passenger says, ""Abuse of power, obviously.""

Testifying at Civilian Complaint Review Board (CCRB) tomorrow to jump-start the independent investigation into yesterday's Uber incident.

The detective comes back and continues, ""Now let me tell you something the next time you do it again.""

The driver interrupts and says, ""Okay.""

The detective yells, ""Okay what? You don't let me [expletive] finish? Stop interrupting me!""

The driver apologizes to the detective.

The detective then says, ""Who do you think you're talking to here? ... Every time I open my mouth you have something to say.""

The detective ends with saying, ""The only reason you're not in handcuffs going to jail ... is because I have things to do, that's the only reason that's not happening.""

The Uber driver was never given a ticket, police said.

Seth testified before the CCRB today. If it finds the complaint against Cherry legitimate, the detective would get a mark on his record, but it is up to Commissioner Bratton to determine a punishment. Verbal abuse in and of itself is not a terminable offense, according to police sources. The CCRB would first have to find Cherry guilty of misconduct and then that decision would get forwarded to the commissioner with a disciplinary recommendation. Punishment for such a matter could include losing pay or vacation days.

Uber responded to the incident with a statement.

""The behavior in the video is wrong and unacceptable and we appreciate the NYPD investigating the incident. We are in touch with our driver-partner who was subjected to this terrible experience and will continue to provide any support he needs,"" Uber told ABC's New York station WABC.

Michael Palladino, president of the Detectives' Endowment Association, noted he is ""not trying to minimize the significance of what occurred.""

""I am simply pointing out that cops are just like everyone else,"" Palladino added. ""They have families, friends, and other things going on in their lives, too, that may affect their behavior at times. There is no disputing that we are held to a higher standard and that is why this incident is so newsworthy. Detective Cherry is a person of good character and an excellent Detective. He really should not be judged by one isolated incident.""

""I want to hear what Pete has to say, and I'll make a decision once I've done that.""

Rose's previous efforts to gain leniency from commissioners Fay Vincent and Bud Selig were never considered.

Rose, 73, played from 1963 to 1986, amassing 4,256 hits, still a major league record. Three years after he retired, Rose agreed to a permanent ban from baseball amid accusations he gambled on games while playing and managing for the Cincinnati Reds.

Gaining reinstatement from the commissioner could be the first step to Rose reaching the Hall of Fame. In 1991, the Hall voted to ban players on the permanently ineligible list from induction.

Manfred, who is a member of the Hall of Fame board, said he has had no discussions with the museum about its plans regarding Rose.

""Honestly, I don't think people should read any disposition into what I'm saying about this. I see it as a really simple thing. He's made a request,"" Manfred said. ""Part of my obligations under the major league constitution is to deal with those requests, and I'll deal with it.""

Manfred took over from Selig in January after serving under him as MLB's chief operating officer and longtime negotiator in collective bargaining. Selig was a staunch opponent of allowing Rose back into the game.

Manfred, who has been making the rounds of major league spring training camps in Florida and Arizona, said the subject of Rose's standing has been among the more frequent questions he has fielded from players. Manfred addressed the Dodgers players and coaches briefly Monday morning.

Dodgers manager Don Mattingly said he thinks there will come a time ""when we all kind of move on."" Mattingly said he first met Rose in a spring training game when Rose was playing for the Montreal Expos.

""I got a hit off somebody, and he said, '200 a year, kid. Just get 200 a year.' Any time I see him, I love seeing him,"" Mattingly said. ""Obviously, as a kid, I loved Pete and the way he played. I'm not going to get into all the politics and everything that goes along with that, but I love Pete and I think Pete's a great player."""

The men drove off Wednesday with the miniature schnauzer and at least five other dogs inside the Urban Out Sitters minivan.

Here is what happened:

Just before 4 p.m. Wednesday, two armed men stole a running minivan with only the dogs inside, according to the Chicago Police Department.

When a witness tried to intervene, one man drew a gun and pointed it at him, police said. The offenders then fled the scene.

The van's driver was uninjured, according to Joseph Giannini, owner of Urban Out Sitters, a company that offers pet boarding, day care and dog walking services.

The dogs had been en route home from doggy day care, says Tad Tomita, the owner of the stolen miniature schnauzer.

Tomita said his wife texted him saying their dog, a 3-year-old black and silver miniature schnauzer named Mochi, had been kidnapped.

""I didn't understand what that meant,"" Tomita told ABC News today. ""When I called her and she told me what happened, I couldn't comprehend what was going on. It's so surreal.""

Tomita said he and his wife talked to the day care and filed a police report. He said he tried giving police more information about Mochi, but ""they weren't very interested in talking to us, which was a little frustrating.""

""After that we went over to the day care and some of the other owners were there,"" Tomita said. ""We want the public to look for the van so we can get our dog back.""

Giannini, the Urban Out Sitters owner, told ABC News he has also been driving around Chicago this morning, but so far there have been no updates in the case.

""We've heard nothing,"" Giannini said. ""We're devastated. We want the safe return of these dogs right now.""

""Urban Out Sitters is doing everything it can to try to locate the van,"" Giannini said, adding, ""There's not a lot of resources available to do so. So we're working together as a team,” he added.

The van is a 2002 silver Chrysler Town & Country with Illinois license plate R18 8669.

Giannini is especially concerned because of the record-low temperatures. It reached -8 degrees in Chicago overnight.

But Mochi's owner isn't losing hope. Tomita said there were reports overnight of dogs barking in the Southwest side of the city, so he and his mother are driving around the area this morning, ""Just on the off-chance we'll find something.""

Tomita describes Mochi as, ""just a wonderful dog.""

""My wife and I just really want her back,"" he said.

The van and canines are still missing today and the investigation is ongoing, police said."
1CoPcOr,2015-02-13 00:00:00,Some of the Top Names in Tech Skip Obama’s Cybersecurity Summit - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/top-names-tech-skipping-obamas-cybersecurity-summit/story?id=28952290,"Following a spate of high-profile cyber hacks – from Sony to CentCom – President Obama today convened the White House Summit on Cybersecurity and Consumer Protection, where some of the top names in tech will discuss how to protect Americans from online crime.

But several key tech execs won’t be there: Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, Yahoo’s Marissa Mayer, and Google’s Larry Paige and Eric Schmidt all declined White House invitations, opting to send top information security executives instead, according to Bloomberg News.

“Everybody’s online, and everybody’s vulnerable,” Obama said at the summit, drawing laughter after he joked about his own weak passwords: “password, or 123457 … Those are some of my previous passwords. I’ve changed them since then.”

The summit comes as websites struggle to balance consumer privacy with national security. Once some of the president’s most enthusiastic financial backers, the tech sector’s relationship with Obama began to sour when Edward Snowden revealed the extent of the NSA snooping in 2013.

However, neither Zuckerberg, Mayer, Paige nor Schmidt have publicly shared their reasons for skipping the event – and White House Deputy Press Secretary Eric Schultz told reporters yesterday that the administration was “pleased” with private sector participation.

According to Yahoo, ""given the focus of the conversation, it made the most sense"" to send a member of the team devoted to cyber security.

Yahoo’s Chief Information Security Officer, Alex Stamos, Google’s Vice President for Security Engineering, Eric Grosse, and Facebook’s Chief Information Security Officer, Joe Sullivan, will participate in a panel, as will Intel President Renee James, Microsoft Vice President for Trustworthy Computing Scott Charney, Box Co-Founder Aaron Levine, and CEOs from American Express, MasterCard, Visa, and Bank of America.

Apple CEO Tim Cook (currently under fire for his company’s strict encryption practices, which make it difficult for law enforcement agencies to read criminals’ data) agreed to deliver remarks.

The president today signed an executive order urging private companies to share cyber-threat information with the federal government and with one another.

""The notion that the West is at war with Islam is an ugly lie,"" Obama said. ""And all of us -- regardless of our faith -- have a responsibility to reject it.""

""We need to break the cycle of conflict, especially sectarian conflict, that have become magnets for violent extremism,” he added.

The president said that the coalition of 60 countries that has been conducting air strikes against ISIS “will not relent” to destroy the organization in Iraq and Syria.

“These terrorists are desperate for legitimacy,” Obama said, which is why he said they target Muslim communities.

Obama said both wealthy and developing nations need to take steps to improve the economic situation around the world, though he said poverty alone does not prompt someone to become a terrorist.

Obama said many people in countries with small Muslim populations get a distorted impression from news coverage. He specifically called out groups like women and young people to help prevent potential recruits from joining terrorist groups.

“Young people are not tapped for hate, it doesn’t come naturally to them. We adults teach them,” he said.

Obama continued to say that everyone has to work to bring more positive attention to the Muslim community.

“Groups like al Qaeda and ISIL peddle the lie that some of our countries are hostile to Muslims,” he said, adding that “we can’t allow cycles of suspicion to tear at the fabric of our cultures.""

Apple will live stream its ""Spring Forward"" event from the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts on Monday at 1 p.m. ET.

The flagship wearable device is set to ship in April, however Apple hasn't yet revealed an exact release date.

Since Tim Cook showed off the watch last September, Apple has been dropping tantalizing teases about its first wearable. The watch even landed its first magazine cover, gracing the wrist of a model on the front of November's issue of Vogue China.

While there are plenty of questions that will likely be answered on Monday, there is plenty we do know about the Apple Watch.

The wearable comes equipped with Apple Pay and a rich ecosystem of apps that can help keep the wearer informed with nuggets of information throughout the day, such as a dinner date or a flight delay.

It's also compatible with the iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 5, iPhone 5C and iPhone 5S. It is expected to begin at a price point of $349 and will come in three editions: Apple Watch Sport, the standard Apple Watch and a luxury gold edition. Consumers can expect to pay more for the high-end versions.

While other wearables focus on a touch screen, Apple is making navigation on the watch head easier by letting users move the digital crown to toggle between apps.

The wrist is ""a very interesting place"" because users can glance at it while ""you can't glance at a lot of other places on your body,"" Cook told ABC News' David Muir in an exclusive interview after the watch was announced last year.

""You can measure a lot of things from there and you can just get, honestly, a tidbit today of what all it can do,"" Cook said. ""But I think it's huge.""

The watch is expected to surpass the bestselling Pebble wearable -- but competitors shouldn't lament Apple's entry into the market.

""The Apple Watch is good news for the entire wearables segment because it will take consumer awareness to a whole new level,"" Ben Wood, chief of research at CCS Insight, a technology analysis firm, told ABC News last month.

""If you don't own an iPhone but you are keen to join the smart watch party, there are alternatives,"" he added."

He said he made his decision after consulting with family members, concussion researchers, friends and current and former teammates, as well as studying what is known about the relationship between football and neurodegenerative disease.

""I just honestly want to do what's best for my health,"" Borland told ""Outside the Lines."" ""From what I've researched and what I've experienced, I don't think it's worth the risk.""

Borland becomes the most prominent NFL player to leave the game in his prime because of concerns about brain injuries. More than 70 former players have been diagnosed with progressive neurological disease following their deaths, and numerous studies have shown connections between the repetitive head trauma associated with football, brain damage and issues such as depression and memory loss.

""I feel largely the same, as sharp as I've ever been. For me, it's wanting to be proactive,"" Borland said. ""I'm concerned that if you wait till you have symptoms, it's too late. ... There are a lot of unknowns. I can't claim that X will happen. I just want to live a long healthy life, and I don't want to have any neurological diseases or die younger than I would otherwise.""

The 49ers, in a statement, confirmed Borland's retirement and wished him the best.

""While unexpected, we certainly respect Chris' decision,"" team general manager Trent Baalke said. ""From speaking with Chris, it was evident that he had put a great deal of thought into this decision. He was a consummate professional from day one and a very well respected member of our team and community. Chris is a determined young man that overcame long odds in his journey to the NFL and we are confident he will use the same approach to become very successful in his future endeavors. We will always consider him a 49er and wish him all the best.""

Borland was expected to be a key part of the 49ers defense this season, after the retirement of All-Pro linebacker Patrick Willis last week. Borland replaced Willis, 30, after six games last season; Willis had sustained a toe injury.

Willis' retirement had no role in his decision, Borland said.

Borland said there was no chance he would change his mind. The third-round draft pick, who starred at the University of Wisconsin, said he has had just two diagnosed concussions: one while playing soccer in the eighth grade, the other while playing football as a sophomore in high school.

Borland, who is listed at 5-foot-11, 248 pounds, earned accolades for his aggressiveness and instincts at inside linebacker. He had 107 tackles and a sack in 14 games, eight of them starts. He was the NFC's defensive player of the week for his performance against the New York Giants in Week 11. He led the 49ers with 13 tackles in that game and became the team's first rookie linebacker with two interceptions in one game. He received one vote for NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year."

Officials seized tires from eight teams following the last two races, including tires from Kurt Busch and Joey Logano.

“Bleeding” involves poking miniscule holes in the tires to slowly release air, improving tire durability and helping drivers get an ideal grip on the track. NASCAR officials confiscated the wheels of Logano and Kevin Harvick two weeks ago, and those tires did not show evidence of “bleeding.”

NASCAR is still awaiting results from the latest eight tests. ABC News attempted to contact all of the crews involved in the investigation, but those efforts were unsuccessful. If caught cheating, drivers could face as much as a $125,000 fine and a six-race suspension.

“If it’s out there and they know about it, you should be gone forever,” Hamlin said. “If they find [impropriety] multiple times with somebody, they should have a permanent vacation somewhere.”

NASCAR officials told ABC News that the tire inspections are frequently performed and not unusual, but normally these measures don’t receive such widespread attention. Superstar Jeff Gordon is concerned by the recent investigations.

“I've heard a lot of things with valve caps and poking holes in tires for years. But I've never seen it done. I've never had proof that it was done,” Gordon said. ""So it's very interesting to me that NASCAR is investigating this further."""

1CpVfUz,2015-03-25 00:00:00,"Germanwings Crash: Audio File Recovered From Black Box, Official Says - ABC News",http://abcnews.go.com/International/americans-germanwings-plane-official/story?id=29887148,"The director of the lead investigating agency said today that they have recovered an audio file from the black box of the downed Germanwings flight but have not found the second black box from the Airbus A320 that crashed in the French Alps.

This comes after French Prime Minister Francois Hollande said at an earlier news conference when he said that crews had found the exterior of the black box but not the module that contains the memory equipment, though a the director of the Bureau d’Enquetes et d’Analyses (BEA) went on to deny any such discovery.

""We have not localized the black box,"" said BEA Director Rémi Jouty. ""We have not found any debris of the black box and in the history of air accidents we know about ... [we] don't remember any recorder broken into little pieces.""

When asked if they had ruled out the possibility of the crash being the result of a terrorist attack, he said the BEA is ""not ruling out any hypothesis at this stage.""

They have recovered an audio file from the first black box, the cockpit voice recorder, though no further details were revealed about whether or not voices are heard on the recording.

Jouty noted that it would take days for initial findings to be released, though it will be weeks before a full understanding is clear, but he was able to weigh in and tentatively ruled several possible causes out based on the debris pattern.

""The area seems very big but the debris seems very small which is not at all consistent with an aircraft that exploded mid-air,"" Jouty said.

""At the moment, there's no information leading us to think that the weather conditions were particularly bad,"" he said.

Jouty said that the flight path looks consistent with one controlled by a pilot, but that may also be attributable to the plane's automatic pilot settings, saying that it was ""too soon to draw any conclusions.""

One of the problems facing investigators is the location of the crash site, as the area is very steep and unstable. Investigators and site crews have to be tied to one another when they are near the crash site to ensure their safety, Jouty said.

""After 20 years in this industry and being a Lufthansa pilot myself, we still can't understand waht happened here yesterday,"" Germanwings CEO Carsten Spohr said at a press conference in Barcelona this evening.

""We have an aircraft in perfect technical condition with two experienced pilots which was involved in such a terrible accident,"" Spohr said.

Earlier today, Germanwings CEO Thomas Winkelmann noted that two Americans were on board the Germanwings flight that crashed. The U.S. State Department has since confirmed that there were three Americans on board.

Two of the Americans were later identified as Yvonne Selke, and employee of Booz Allen, and Selke's daughter, Emily, according to Betty Thompson, the company's chief personnel officer.

The Germanwings plane crashed Tuesday in the Alps in southern France with 150 people on board, including two babies, the airline said. French President Francois Hollande said there were ""apparently no survivors.""

Searchers returned to the crash scene today, as France's minister of the interior said a black box voice recorder from the plane is damaged. Even so, said the official, Bernard Cazeneuve, the information on the recorder should be retrievable.

The CEO of Lufthansa, which owns Germanwings, said a full analysis of the voice recorder was expected to be done by Thursday. But Brice Robin, public prosecutor of Marseille, said on BFM TV that black box results could take several days.

The initial focus for the voice recorder investigators will be ""on the human voices, the conversations,"" followed by the cockpit sounds, France's transport minister, Alain Vidalies, told Europe 1 radio this morning.

Police helicopter searches of the Germanwings Airbus crash site resumed Wednesday morning.

Xavier Roy, coordinator for French air rescue, told ABC News that no bodies are going to be taken from the mountain today, and that the investigation on site will take a week. Unlike other crash sites, Roy said, there isn't much to find.

""When you go to a crash site you expect to recognize parts of an airplane."" he said. ""Sadly, here you don't see anything -- just debris scattered all over.""

He added that this was a difficult area to search, as it is ""nearly impossible to reach by foot,"" making it challenging to get rescuers in and out of the area safely.

The top priorities now are locating bodies and the second black box, he said.

In addition to 72 Germans, 35 Spanish and two Americans on board, Winkelmann, the Germanwings CEO, said there were two victims each from Australia, Argentina, Iran and Venezuela. One victim each came from Britain, the Netherlands, Colombia, Mexico, Japan, Denmark, Belgium and Israel, he said, adding that the list isn't yet final because the company is still trying to contact relatives of 27 victims. Winkelmann added that in some cases victims' nationality weren’t clear because of possible dual citizenship.

A German high school has posted the names of their 16 students and two colleagues who were all on board the flight and died in the crash as they were returning from a Spanish-language exchange program.

Hollande, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy were scheduled to arrive at the crash staging area today.

The cause of the crash has not yet been determined, the Germanwings CEO said. Lufthansa called the crash ""an accident.""

""Seeing the site of the accident was harrowing,"" Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr tweeted this morning. ""We are in deep mourning. Our thoughts are with the relatives of the victims.""

“We’ve tried this current policy that we have prohibiting travel for about 50 years, and it hasn’t worked, so it’s time for something new,” Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Arizona, one of the sponsors of the bill, said. “It’s time to allow Americans to travel freely to Cuba.”

“It makes no sense to have this prohibition,” Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, another sponsor of the bill, said.

The legislation, titled “The Freedom to Travel to Cuba Act of 2015,” is sponsored by four Republican and four Democratic senators. The Republican senators include: Flake, Jerry Moran of Kansas, Mike Enzi of Wyoming and John Boozman of Arkansas.

They said they expected other farm-state senators to join them in lifting the travel ban. The Democratic sponsors: Leahy, Dick Durbin of Illinois, Tom Udall of New Mexico and Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island.

Even though the bill has Republican support, it’s an open question whether the legislation to lift the travel ban will be called for a vote in the Senate.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has been critical of the administration’s Cuba policy, saying he defers to Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, who is an ardent critic of lifting the travel ban or the embargo.

Earlier this month, the White House eased restrictions on the U.S. travel ban by permitting travel to Cuba for 12 categories of people, including Americans with family in Cuba, employees on official business for the U.S. and foreign governments, and journalists.

Congress will need to pass legislation lifting the travel ban in order for all Americans to travel to the country located just 90 miles from the United States."

That's according to baby naming web site Nameberry, who has published a list of names ""on the verge of extinction.""

Other female names about to go the way of the dinosaur? Claudine, Sheba and Sondra, among others.

Nanette peaked in 1956, according to the site. Claudine, the female version of the ancient Roman name Claudius, peaked in 1970 and fell off the charts in 1975.

""Claudine along with most other once-popular –ine and –een-ending girls’ names are now out of favor,"" according to Nameberry.

As for Sondra, it's demise has to do with Hurricane Sandy. It ""took a lot of wind out of all forms of this name, given to only five girls in 2013.""

As for boys' names, did you know the name Elmo didn't originate with the furry red monster? It is the short form of Guglielmo, the Italian form of William, said Nameberry. It disappeared around the 1950s. And where's Waldo? Almost nowhere, it seems. The name was given to just five boys last year, according to Nameberry. It was most popular in 1881, when it ranked 347.

Also given to only five babies last year: Sherwood. ""The stiff surname Sherwood, which does have the distinguished namesake of influential novelist Sherwood Anderson, managed to make it onto the list from 1897 to 1963, peaking at Number 533 in 1938, Anderson’s heyday.""

Debbie Wasserman Schultz today called on GOP presidential candidates to disavow comments made by former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani in which he said he doesn’t believe President Obama “loves America.”

Giuliani made the comments at a private dinner Wednesday featuring Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, a potential 2016 presidential candidate, according to Politico.

Wasserman Schultz, in a speech to the Association of Democratic State Chairs at the DNC Winter Meeting today in Washington, D.C., called on the possible candidates to “start leading.”

“One of the GOP frontrunners was sitting just feet away, and didn’t say a word,” the Florida congresswoman said, referring to Walker.

“If the Republican Party really wants to be taken seriously, really wants to avoid its problems of the past, now is the time for its leaders to stop this kind of nonsense. Enough… I would challenge my Republican colleagues and anyone in the Republican Party to say enough. They need to start leading.”

Wasserman Schultz mentioned several of the possible contenders by name and said she “rarely agreed with President Bush, but I never questioned his love for our country. I don’t often agree with my Republican colleagues on the Hill, but I know they love America.”

She isn’t the only Democrat to speak out. In a news conference today, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio condemned Giuliani’s remarks but, of Walker said, “I hear a deafening silence.”

At the dinner, Giuliani said “with all our flaws we’re the most exceptional country in the world. I’m looking for a presidential candidate who can express that, do that and carry it out,” according to Politico. ""And if it’s you Scott, I’ll endorse you. And if it’s somebody else, I’ll support somebody else.”

Walker appeared on CNBC today, but wouldn’t respond to Giuliani’s comments. “The mayor can speak for himself, I'm not going to comment on what the president thinks or not, he can speak for himself as well,” Walker said.

A spokeswoman from Walker’s political operation, “Our American Revival,” declined to comment further, instead referring ABC News to Walker’s comments on CNBC.

Giuliani tried to walk back the comments this morning on Fox News, saying he is “not questioning his patriotism,” referring to the president.

“He’s a patriot, I’m sure,” Giuliani said. “What I’m saying is, in his rhetoric, I very rarely hear the things that I used to hear Ronald Reagan say, the things that I used to hear Bill Clinton say about how much he loves America.”

Obama spokesman Eric Schultz said this afternoon, ""Mr. Giuliani test ran this line of attack during his 2007 run for the presidency. I wasn’t at the dinner and will leave it to those at the dinner to assess whether that was appropriate. He seems to be doing damage control this morning. But I agree with him on one thing: it was a horrible thing to say.”

""It's nature's revenge,"" said Gidon Bromberg, the Israeli Director at EcoPeace Middle East, an organization that brings together Jordanian, Palestinian and Israeli environmentalists to protect their shared environmental heritage.

""These sinkholes are a direct result of the inappropriate mismanagement of water resources in the region.""

More than 1,400 feet below sea level, the Dead Sea is the lowest point on land. The first sinkhole was spotted in the 1980s. By 1990, there were 40, and 15 years later new chasms are breaking open every day.

""They could develop overnight. Or over time,"" Bromberg said. ""Making them unpredictable. And very dangerous.""

With salinity levels ten times that of the Atlantic Ocean, the Dead Sea is evaporating at a rate of nearly four feet per year and large salt pockets are left behind as the water recedes. As ground water dissolves the salt, washing it back into the Dead Sea, empty cavities develop creating massive sink holes.

Bromberg explained that sinkholes develop in clusters, collapsing into each other and creating even larger craters.

""The big fear is that overnight, the road will collapse,"" Bromberg said of Route 90, which runs along the Dead Sea.

A portion of Route 90 was closed for repairs this week after parts of the road sank some two inches.

Bromberg said the only way to halt the opening of these chasms is to ""stabilize"" the Dead Sea.

The Dead Sea relies on the fresh water of the Jordan River -- but only about 5 percent of the historic flow is currently flowing into the Dead Sea.

Bromberg's organization argues that 30 percent of the historic flow would at least be a step in the right direction.

""If nothing is done, it's only a matter of time until someone dies,"" he said."

Nintendo announced today the company is bringing the beloved cartoon plumber and his brother, Luigi, along with a host of other classic characters to mobile devices through a partnership with Japanese gaming company DeNa Co.

While Nintendo has shown results with its console games, the game maker has long shied away from delving into the explosive world of mobile gaming.

In order to be successful, Nintendo President Satoru Iwata said it's crucial that game makers in the space ""provide constantly ever changing content and feel fresh in addition to high quality.""

With Nintendo bringing its cast of characters to the alliance and DeNa providing its mobile gaming expertise, Iwata said the partnership has the chance to reach ""hundreds of millions"" of gamers.

""Know that we are challenging ourselves in this new business area,"" he said. ""We hope hundreds of millions will use and enjoy these products. ... Potentially any Nintendo [intellectual property] could be used in our smart device software.""

Despite the leap into mobile gaming, Iwata revealed today Nintendo is also staying true to its roots by working on a new gaming system code-named NX.

Iwata was tight-lipped about the details but promised that the ""dedicated game platform"" would be a ""brand new concept."" He said Nintendo fanatics could expect to learn more from the company sometime next year."

The University of California-Berkeley student, Eloi Vasquez, 19, was visiting friends at the University of Southern California when he was last heard from early Saturday morning.

""Earlier today the Los Angeles Police Department’s Missing Persons Unit learned that the California Highway Patrol conducted an investigation of a tragic traffic collision that took place on the Eastbound 10 Freeway on Saturday, March 28th around 2:25 a.m. During the investigation, the Los Angeles County Coroner’s Office confirmed that the pedestrian struck on the freeway was unfortunately our Missing Person, Mr. Eloi Vasquez,"" LAPD said in a statement.

Vasquez, who played on his school's soccer team, went to a party at the Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity with friends but told them that he wanted to go for a walk at around 1:30 a.m., ABC station KABC reports.

According to KABC, he was last heard from less than an hour later, when he reportedly called a friend saying that he was at the beach and having trouble.

""He is a star athlete, a responsible student, and we are a tight-knit family,"" his mother Wendy Margolin earlier told ABC News. ""This is not normal behavior.""

When he left the party, he did not have money or identification, the Associated Press reported.

Friends tried to call him later Saturday morning and his phone was either dead or had been turned off.

The family doubled their reward offering to $100,000 today in hopes that it would lead to his discovery.

""Eloi is a wonderful young man who has excelled both academically and athletically here at Cal,"" the UC-Berkeley athletics department said in a statement released Sunday. ""Our entire Cal Athletics family is very concerned for Eloi’s safety and our first priority is to help in any way we can to locate him."""

The Syrian news agency has said that drone was brought down by Syrian air defenses, but U.S. officials could not confirm that report.

""We can confirm that at approximately 1:40 p.m. EDT today, U.S. military controllers lost contact with an U.S. MQ-1 Predator unarmed remotely piloted aircraft operating over northwest Syria,"" said a defense official. ""At this time, we have no information to corroborate press reports that the aircraft was shot down. We are looking into the incident and will provide more details when available.""

Latakia is a major Syrian port and has been under the control of Syrian government forces.

Photos and videos appeared on social media sites Tuesday showing what appeared to be the wreckage of what was claimed to be an American drone that had been flying over Latakia Tuesday evening local time.

One photo appeared to show pieces of wreckage falling from the night sky in flames.

U.S. officials said it was unclear if the U.S. drone was shot down as the Syrians claimed or if it crashed because of mechanical problems.

The Syrian military has one of the largest air defense systems in the Middle East, but it has not engaged any of the U.S. or coalition aircraft that have been flying over Syria conducting reconnaissance and airstrikes against ISIS.

If the American drone was brought down by Syrian air defenses it could create a new security dynamic for the American and coalition aircraft that have had free rein over Syrian airspace since last summer."

The man, who officials say is in his 60s, was arrested by Polish border guards in the town of Terespol, close to the country Belarus, after they opened his suitcase, the size of which had attracted their attention.

""To their surprise, a woman in her 30s emerged,"" border guard spokesman Dariusz Sienicki told French news agency AFP.

Also speaking to ABC News, Sienicki said, “It was a shocking piece of content: his Russian wife. I've never heard of such a thing.""

The couple, who Sienicki said were married in December 2014, were traveling from Moscow to the French city of Nice by train. Both could face up to three years jail time for evading border controls, but Siencki said they had been released and allowed to return to Belarus. They should expect to be summoned to court, he told ABC News.

Oddly enough, the wife needn’t have traveled as hand luggage at all because non-E.U. citizens can visit Poland freely provided they prove they are married to an E.U.-citizen.

""Had she been sitting next to her husband,"" Sienicki said, ""she would have made it through without incident."""

Levi Pettit, a fraternity member of Sigma Alpha Epsilon, was shown in a video discovered earlier this month chanting racial slurs that mentioned lynching and that African Americans would never be in the fraternity. Pettit's parents released an apology on behalf of their son, but Pettit has so far remained silent. The other student who was expelled from the university earlier released a statement of apology.

""Let me start by saying I’m sorry, deeply sorry. I’m so sorry for the pain that I’ve caused and I want you to hear that directly from me. Even though I don’t deserve it I would like to ask for your forgiveness,"" Pettit said, standing beside about a dozen community leaders. He said he ""never thought of myself as a racist.""

When asked by reporters if he knew the meaning of the words, Pettit said, ""I knew they were wrong, but I didn’t know how or why they were wrong.""

""I’m not here to talk about the chant or where I heard it,"" Pettit said. ""The truth of the matter is that the chant is disgusting.""

Pettit said that he did not immediately speak publicly about the incident because he wanted to apologize first to the community that he ""most impacted.""

""The truth is I’ve had a mix of pain, shame, sorrow and fear over the consequences for my actions,"" Pettit said.

The Rev. John Arethaus Reed, Jr., of Fairview Baptist Church said that he and the other community leaders accepted Pettit's apology, though he said he doesn't condone his actions.

Pettit said he will be ""deeply ashamed for the rest of my life"" and that the song was a ""mindlessly sickening chant.""

""It will take me a lifetime to earn [forgiveness] but I’m committed to try,"" Pettit said.

Pettit said: ""There are many things I will need to do to regain the trust of my friends, family and the public at large.""

""I understand completely why I have lost this privilege. However, I do want to find a positive outcome from this awful situation,"" he added.

State Sen. Anastasia Pittman, a Democrat, University of Oklahoma alum and chairwoman of the Oklahoma Black Caucus, hosted the press conference at Oklahoma City's Fairview Baptist Church, The Dallas Morning News reported. Before the event, Pettit was expected to spend an hour behind closed doors with pastors, politicians and African-American community leaders, according to the newspaper.

“I received an apology from him, and I believe it’s sincere,” Pittman told The Dallas Morning News. “But I told him it’s not about me, and that community leaders would need the same courtesy, so if he’s going to apologize to me, I’d rather he apologize to civic leaders, pastors, people who resonate with the pain.

Pittman did not respond to a request for comment from ABC News."

Kubilus added that it’s not uncommon for gravestones to shift, as warmer temperatures thaw the ground in spring.

“I’ve come over and saw six stones fall from the winter. Winter, and the ground gets soft and the stones fall over and you have somebody come and pick them up,” Kubilus told WNEP-TV.

Kraft was on the stand in the Fall River Justice Center in Fall River, Massachusetts, about 40 miles south of Gillette Stadium, where Kraft said he last spoke to Hernandez for about ""five to 10 minutes."" Kraft said he ""vaguely"" remembered that Hernandez told him he was ""completely innocent.""

Hernandez, 25, is charged with killing Odin Lloyd on June 17, 2013. Lloyd, 27, was dating the sister of Hernandez's fiancee and was found shot to death in an industrial park less than a mile from a home that Hernandez and his fiancee shared.

Kraft said he approached Hernandez on June 19, 2013, in the weight room of Gillette Stadium and asked to speak with him. At that time, media were reporting about Hernandez's involvement in the incident.

Kraft mostly answered ""yes"" and ""no"" to questions from both the defense and prosecution, revealing that the businessman had ""no problems"" with Hernandez in the stadium, but admitted to an attorney that he didn't know much about the player's life outside of the stadium.

""You were at Gillette stadium and you saw all the media assembled there,"" an attorney asked Kraft. ""The media coverage at that point was non-stop and it was extensive. And that bothered you, didn't it?""

Kraft then answered ""yes.""

Kraft said earlier when he took the stand, ""I had heard there was an incident that had transpired,"" and that he had asked Hernandez ""whether he was involved.""

""Any player involved in our system ... I consider family,"" Kraft said. ""I wanted to get him help.""

""He hugged and kissed me and thanked me for my concern,"" Kraft said of Hernandez, saying he didn't see Hernandez after that conversation.

The defense attorney asked questions about Hernandez's contract through the 2018 season, asking why Kraft would make such a long-term investment in the player, to which Kraft responded, ""He's a very good player.""

Last month, a trainer that's not employed by the team testified in the trial. Coach Bill Belichick and linebacker Brandon Spikes are on the witness list, but it's not clear if they will be called to the stand."
1CsZ4qX,2015-04-01 00:00:00,Indiana Gov. Mike Pence Says He 'Could Have Handled' Religious Freedom Law Better - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/indiana-gov-mike-pence-handled-religious-freedom-law/story?id=30026937,"Indiana Gov. Mike Pence today admitted that he mishandled the passage of a religious freedom law and now wants a piece of legislation to clarify that it does not give anyone the right to discriminate in the state.

""This law does not give anyone a license to deny services to gay and lesbian couples. I could have handled that better this week,"" he said.

His comments came hours before the state House of Representatives in Arkansas passed amendments to a similar religious freedom bill that is expected to be codified into law when the governor signs the complete version, which he has already announced that he plans to do.

In Indiana, Pence said that he has been working with state legislators and businesses “literally around the clock” to work through the controversy, saying that discrimination was never part of his plan.

""I don’t believe for a minute that it was the intention of the general assembly. ... It certainly wasn’t my intent but I can appreciate that that's become the perception ... and we need to confront that and we need to confront that boldly,” he said.

The changes that Pence mentioned are expected to be put into a stripped version of an election-related bill that is slated to be debated Wednesday or Thursday by a conference committee, Indiana's Republican speaker of the House's spokesman Brian Bosma told ABC News.

The new language is expected to be debated throughout the night between business leaders, state legislators and stakeholders.

“As I said we've got a perception problem here ... and we intend to correct that,"" Pence said this morning.

He slammed “gross mischaracterizations about the bill” and the smeared reputations of Hoosiers as a result of the backlash.

“We want to make it clear that Indiana is open for business, we want to make it clear that Hoosier hospitality is not a slogan it's a way of life,” he said.

""The things that have been said about our state have been at times deeply offensive to me and I will continue to use every effort to defend the good and decent people of Indiana,"" Pence added.

The controversial law -- called the Religious Freedom Restoration Act -- was signed by Pence last week and prompted national outcry from human rights groups and businesses, though a number of likely Republican presidential candidates have all come out in support of the law.

""It's been a tough week here in the Hoosier state but we're going to move forward,"" he said today.

Pence told ABC News this weekend that he would not be adding sexual orientation as a protected class in any amendment to the law. He specifically referenced the This Week appearance during today's press conference, saying that ""going into that interview this weekend I was just determined to set the record straight about what the law really is.""

He has followed that interview up with an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal and a news appearance this morning where he adamantly stated that he stands by the law.

State Democratic leaders slammed Pence for calling for additional legislation to clarify Indiana’s controversial religious freedom law, calling for the law to be repealed fully.

Democratic House Minority Leader Scott Pelath said Republicans are “doubling down” by asking for until they stop doubling down they're going to have a tough time convincing people that they're the right mechanics to fix this problem.

“I see some indication that there’s an awareness that he’s in a difficult political situation,” Pelath said in reference to Pence’s news conference this morning. “I don’t see any indication that there’s a willingness to admit that a mistake has been made.""

Senate Democratic Leader Tim Lanane said that the religious freedom bill is “very, very toxic and very, very wrong,” and the repercussions are being felt in business communities as a “growing list” of national corporations speak out against their future plans to operate in the state.

“What’s happened here is that this situation created by this bill has gone beyond being about just about the bill... to the very question of does Indiana discriminate,” Lanane said.

The debate over the future of the Indiana law comes at the same time as Arkansas was in the process of passing a similar bill.

Arkansas's state House of Representatives had already passed a ""religious freedom"" bill but the state's Senate added some amendments which were voted on, and passed, this afternoon. A spokeswoman for the House of Representatives confirmed to ABC News that all three amendments passed with overwhelming majorities and that the bill would now be sent to Gov. Asa Hutchinson's desk, who has already said he will sign it.

According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, in addition to Indiana and Arkansas there are 10 other states with similar bills in the works and 19 states already have similar laws in place.

Seven people have become infected with the drug-resistant ""superbug"" known as CRE at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center after undergoing endoscopy procedures, and CRE may have played a role in two of its patients' deaths, the hospital said Wednesday afternoon, adding that 179 people were exposed to the germ.

""There are several manufacturers for these scopes,"" said Dr. Benjamin Schwartz, deputy chief of the acute communicable disease control program, Los Angeles County Department of Public Health. ""Because of the complexity of these scopes, which is necessary for the life-saving procedures for these scopes, they are very, very difficult to clean. The manufacturer recommendations were followed by UCLA.""

The first case occurred in mid-December when a patient became ill after undergoing endoscopy to examine his or her gallbladder, the hospital has learned.

""The patient developed almost immediately an infection afterwards with unusual bacteria that was resistant to strains of normally active antibiotics,"" Rubin said, explaining that it took time to trace the cases back to this original patient.

The hospital has now taken all of its scopes out of use, and has implemented additional cleaning protocols beyond manufacturer recommendations. It has emailed and called all patients who underwent endoscopy from Oct. 23 through Jan. 28, officials said."

Voss lived at 119 2nd Avenue -- one of four buildings that were impacted in Thursday's fire. One building completely collapsed while two buildings partially collapsed, according to a New York City official.

""I just think the most shocking part of it,"" Voss told ABC News, ""is I'll never go back.""

Voss wrote on Instagram, ""In less than a day I have felt broken-hearted, displaced, vulnerable and also courageous, resilient and greatly supported. I have my life and my faith and my relationships and my memories and those are the most important. For me moving forward, this is a new start completely. My prayers go out to everyone affected by this tragedy.""

Around 3:17 p.m. Thursday, witnesses reported what sounded like an explosion at Sushi Park restaurant at 121 2nd Avenue, which is at the bottom of a five-story, pre-war building that houses a handful of residential units.

Neither Voss nor his roommates were home at the time.

""I was walking from the West Village and I could see a black tunnel and smoke above the building. Everyone was saying it was a huge fire,"" Voss said.

""I went back as soon as I heard of the fire and couldn't get close,"" he said.

At least 25 people were injured and two people are unaccounted for, according to officials.

It was unclear how many people were inside the building when the fire occurred, according to the New York City Fire Department.

""Preliminary evidence suggests a gas-related explosion,"" said New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, adding that the investigation is ongoing. He said the incident ""appears to have been caused by plumbing and gas work that occurred in 121 2nd Avenue.""

Actress Drea De Matteo said her longtime home also was among those destroyed.

De Matteo posted this photo to Instagram and wrote, ""NYC's finest trying to put out the flames to mine n many others apartments"""

The airline said they handed those files over to investigators.

In the statement, Lufthansa confirmed that Andreas Lubitz had taken a break ""for several months"" during his training and when he returned in 2009, he submitted forms ""about a 'previous episode of severe depression.'""

In spite of that admission, he went on to receive ""the medical certificate confirming his fitness to fly"" and he went on to complete his training and earn a spot as a co-pilot for Germanwings, a subsidiary of Lufthansa.

The company went on to clarify that Lubitz had a ""fully valid class 1 medical certificate"" at the time of the fatal flight on March 24.

Lubitz's medical history is one of the main areas of inquiry for investigators after he allegedly locked his captain out of the cockpit and proceeded to crash a plane into the French Alps.

All 150 on board, including Lubitz, died.

Lufthansa also said that the medical and training documents have been submitted to the Dusseldorf Public Prosecutor.

The extent of Lubitz's psychological issues has not been fully revealed, though Dusseldorf prosecutor Christoph Kumpa said Monday that Lubitz had been treated by a psychotherapist prior to the completion of his flight training for suicidal tendencies.

The shooting tonight, in which two police officers were also wounded, occurred just hours after a gunman killed one person and wounded three cops at a free-speech event at a café in the Danish city, police said.

Police were looking for at least one gunman in that attack at the Krudttoenden cafe, which Danish officials described as terrorism and an assassination attempt.

""We feel certain now that it is a politically motivated attack, and thereby it is a terrorist attack,"" Danish Prime Minister Helle Thornin-Schmidt said of the cafe shooting.

Police tweeted early Sunday local time that officers shot a man at the city's Norrebro train station, but did not say whether it was connected to the shootings at the synagogue and the cafe. They also said the condition of the person shot was unknown.

At a news conference late Saturday night, police asked residents to respect road blocks set up around the crime scenes, but said there is no curfew or lockdown in the city.

Officials also said that residents should continue about their regular routine as there is a ""massive presence of police in Copenhagen.""

Police initially said they were looking for two shooters in the attack at the cafe, but after interviews with witnesses they said they believed there was only one.

They released a security photo of the suspect, showing a man in a dark coat, with what appeared to be a reddish hat and scarf covering much of his face.

The shooting happened about 4 p.m. at an event titled ""Art, Blasphemy and Freedom of Expression,"" organized by Swedish artist Lars Vilks, who has faced several threats after caricaturing the Prophet Muhammad.

""I'm not sure how many shots but I'd say about 20 or 30 shots,"" sais Dennis Myhoff-Brink, who witnessed the attack . ""And, people panicked of course and ran to the doors. Other people were hiding behind tables they had turned over.""

Vilks, 68, who was not injured in the shooting, said he believed he was the intended target.

""What other motive could there be? It's possible it was inspired by Charlie Hebdo,"" he told The Associated Press.

The shooting happened a month after gunmen opened fire on the Charlie Hebdo satirical magazine in Paris, killing 12 people.

The windows of the cafe were riddled with dozens of bullet holes, reported Danish news channel TV2.

The conditions of the three officers injured were not released by police, according to the AP. The 40-year-old victim was not identified.

While no one has claimed responsibility for the shooting, one of the organizers, Helle Merete Brix, told the AP she felt Vilks was targeted.

""I saw a masked man running past,"" Brix said. ""I clearly consider this as an attack on Lars Vilks."""
1CTquqG,2015-02-02 00:00:00,U.S. Considers Arming Ukraine to Fight Separatists - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/International/us-considers-arming-ukraine-fight-separatists/story?id=28673187,"A growing number of senior military and civilian advisors to President Obama support providing defensive weapons to Ukraine as that country comes under increasing attacks by Russian-backed separatist groups.

New discussions about specifically what aid to provide the fledgling Ukrainian forces comes as pro-Russian rebels announced plans to increase their ranks to 100,000 volunteers in coming weeks. Observers say the rebels are unlikely to find so many additional volunteers and this could just be a cover to bring in more Russian troops.

Ceasefire talks broke down over the weekend followed by some of the deadliest fighting to date, with 28 Ukrainian soldiers killed.

Multiple senior U.S. officials confirm that chief among those advocating for a more aggressive support is Gen. Philip Breedlove, NATO’s military commander, as New York Times first reported on Sunday. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, who will likely be replaced by the end of the month, also supports sending defensive weapons. Secretary of State John Kerry is expected to discuss the issue with Ukrainian leadership when he visits Kiev on Thursday.

So far the U.S. has provided Ukrainians with mostly non-lethal aide, including night vision goggles, Explosive Ordinance Detection robots, armor and patrol boats. The U.S. has even provided counter-mortar radar systems designed to locate the launch point of incoming mortar rounds.

But those systems can’t defend against the artillery attacks, which are devastating Ukrainian civilians and military forces. The U.S. has sophisticated defensive systems to locate artillery rounds at its disposal, but providing those systems has proven to be a more delicate military and political dilemma. That’s because most of the artillery fire is coming from inside Russia, while the mortars are coming from the rebels. U.S. officials, discussing the matter on the condition of anonymity, tell ABC News the Obama administration is wary of providing weapons that would directly engage Russian forces, a move that would all but solidify a proxy war with Putin.

""We are constantly assessing our policies in Ukraine to ensure they are responsive, appropriate, and calibrated to achieve our objectives,” the White House said in an emailed statement Monday. “That said, we are particularly concerned about recent escalating separatist violence and separatist attempts to expand the territory they currently occupy further beyond the ceasefire line agreed to in Minsk on September 19, as well as the increasing toll of civilian and military casualties.”

The statement also said the White remains focused on “pursuing a solution through diplomatic means.”

But a new report generated by a group of former senior American officials, including the former NATO commander Adm. James Stavridis, says the U.S. needs to “bolster deterrence in Ukraine” by providing $3 billion in defensive military aid to the Ukrainians over the next three years. The reports says that support should include, among other things, sending unmanned surveillance drones, electronic anti-drone devices, armored Humvees, light armored missiles, and counter-battery radars."

That understated phrase summed up how dozens of counter-terrorism professionals described the toll – physical, psychological and emotional – that working for years in the life and death race against terrorists takes on daily life in the post-9/11 era, according to a study recently published on the CIA's website.

The study, “Counterterrorism Professionals Reflect on Their Work,” paints a picture of the counterterrorism [CT] professional who, while feeling intensely rewarded by the importance of their work, can become wholly consumed by it, and become paranoid and cynical about the world around them – unable to enjoy “normal” lives in the rare cases they can pry themselves from the job.

“[My wife] pulled me back from the brink of becoming obsessed, and not in a good way, with the terrorists [his team was tracking],” an unidentified CT worker said in the study. “There was a whole world out there that was lost to me, for a while, because all I could think about was [the terrorists]. She used some very unflattering words to describe what I was like, told me I was a complete a*****e, but she was right. It was my wakeup call.”

“There is a distinct price” of doing the work and an unavoidable “loss of innocence,” others said.

Last month the CIA published the study, conducted by clinical psychologist Ursula Wilder for the Brookings Institution, in its public “Studies in Intelligence” collection. Wilder said she interviewed 57 CT professionals, from spies to diplomats, analysts to soldiers, emergency workers to journalists, and found that no matter what the specific job is, “one pays a price for daily, direct engagement with evil.”

Those she interviewed talk about being completely lost in their work and neglecting even personal upkeep. Some, many of them intelligence analysts, discussed intense guilt they felt about terrorist attacks they were unable to stop and others became unusually paranoid about the next one around the corner.

“[A CT professional] mentioned being at a sporting event and not being able to ‘get into it’ – and being frightened and unsettled by both intrusive thoughts of how bombs in the crowd would be an effective terror strike and also by his general alienation from the fun and horseplay of the young family members around him,” the study says. “One summed this up by saying: ‘So much came to seem trivial to me, but I realized life is enjoyed in the precious trivial moments, which for a while were lost on me.’”

One of the groups that has been most profoundly affected are what Wilder calls “field professionals” – spies, military and law enforcement personnel, emergency personnel and NGO workers, among others, who work on the ground.

“Field work can be fun – irrespective of the grim contents of terrorism. It can bring a sense of adventure, of experimentation and spontaneous diversion with the unexpected – and, from time to time, crackpot humor,” the study says. “The negatives of field work were equally salient, occasionally reflected in the ‘thousand-yard stares’ of those who have seen the horror, touched the carnage, heard the cries of victims and families, and have smelled the stench of terrorist strikes, none of which can ever be expunged.”

Some field professionals said field work can become “’addictive,’ but not in a good way.""

“For some haunted professionals it has become the only place they feel truly at home, because they crave the excitement or because every place else seems alien and tame,” Wilder says.

For all the negatives, however, Wilder reported the dozens of CT personnel agreed that their work was extremely rewarding because, as one put it, “I felt like I had a bit part in an international passion play that the whole world was watching.”

They also “came to better appreciate the precious and fragile nature of life and of life’s small pleasures because of the terrible, destructive nature of terrorism,” the study says.

For some, facing evil head on led to a new understanding of themselves.

“When you do this type of work, you have to work out for yourself why people can be so evil and also so good,” one said. “We are all human right? So you need to think through your personal philosophy about responsibility, right and wrong. There are no easy answers, but everyone in [CT work] is forced eventually to [address these issues] and hard though it was, I am glad I was forced to. I’m a deeper person, maybe a better one.”

Wilder conducted the study while serving as an Intelligence Community Senior Executive Fellow at the Brookings Institution. A CIA disclaimer notes that the article represents the views of the author and is not endorsed by the U.S. government.

The broadcast continued: ""It is our firm resolution to counteract through our own nuclear strikes [if the United States] provokes a nuclear war [against North Korea), and bring the U.S. to an early demise with our own pre-eminent cyberwarfare if the U.S. tries to bring us down through a cyberattack.

""The U.S. had better know clearly that our means in ground, naval, underwater, air and cyberwarfare, including nuclear strike capability, which are miniaturized, precise and diversified, will be used by our people and army who display the strongest mental power and indomitable ideology and Juche-oriented [self-reliance] strategy and tactics and unique war methods are unprecedented in the human history of wars, which the gangster-like U.S. imperialists can never think of or imitate."""

But doctors say this worry is unfounded.

“Like all biological products, you can never say anything is 100 percent safe,” explained Dr. William Schaffner, professor of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University. “But after millions of doses given around the world, I can tell you that adverse events are extremely rare.”

One person in six reports having a fever within a week of being given a measles shot, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About 5 percent of people experience a mild rash and about 1 percent of people notice some swelling in their glands.

A severe allergy to the shots occurs less than once in a million doses, according to agency statistics. And autism, coma or brain damage as a result of the vaccine is so extraordinarily rare, Schaffner said, it is hard to pinpoint immunization as the true cause.

The American Academy of Pediatrics also affirmed the importance of vaccines, along with their relatively low risk of harm. In a statement on Monday, the group stressed that the MMR vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella is one of the safest and most effective vaccines given, and strongly urged parents to stick to the vaccine schedule recommended by the CDC.

“While it is best to get the vaccine as soon as your child reaches the recommended age, it is never too late to get your children caught up so they can receive the vaccine and be fully protected,” the academy said its statement.

The group also stressed that the dangers of measles are real. Before the vaccine was widely in use, up to 500 children died from the disease each year, said Dr. Richard Besser, ABC News chief health and medical editor.

It is an unfortunate coincidence that vaccines are usually given right around the same time a child is typically flagged for autistic symptoms, Schaffner said.

“It’s often difficult to grasp that just because A comes before B does not mean that A is the cause of B,” he said.

But Schaffner also acknowledged that vaccinations have become such an emotional issue in this country that all the research and statistics in the world won’t sway the opinion of some people.

“As a physician you have to move past it and do your best to be kind and attentive to the needs of the parents and child,"" he said."

Police said the woman’s roommate, Amy Kissinger, witnessed Gerald Montgomery, 51, allegedly using a burglary tool on their back door.

“I asked him if I could help him with something, and he said, ‘I’m a friend of Natalie’s,’” Kissinger said of the alleged crime.

Kissinger sent a text message to her roommate, whose last name was not revealed, and Natalie replied that she wasn’t expecting anyone. The woman then forwarded Kissinger her Uber receipt, which featured an image of the driver – allegedly the same man, Kissinger said.

Montgomery took off before officers arrived, police said, leaving his alleged burglary tools behind. Denver Police Department spokesman Sonny Jackson said the alleged incident was especially alarming for police.

“There is evidence that was left behind that concerns us greatly, that this might have happened to others,” Jackson said. “We have cases that are similar.”

Montgomery is being held on one charge of attempted second-degree burglary. He is expected to appear in court Friday. ABC News was unable to reach Montgomery and to determine whether he has a lawyer,

He has not been accused in any other cases.

Uber representative Taylor Patterson told ABC News the company performed a background check on Montgomery before hiring him.

“Upon learning about this incident from our valued rider, we immediately deactivated the driver’s access to the platform, pending a full investigation,” Patterson said in a statement.

Uber is used in 260 cities around the world, but has become the focus of several recent safety controversies, with some Uber drivers accused of crimes such as battery and sexual assault."

Millions of pleistophora mulleri parasites flood into the muscles of the gammarus duebeni celticus shrimp, turning their skin milky white and giving them an insatiable appetite for their young, according to the paper published in the latest issue of the journal, Royal Society Open Science.

On their best day, the shrimp are not entirely innocent of cannibalism, the researchers noted. Even uninfected shrimp routinely feast on their own offspring. But infected shrimp are some scary scampi, scarfing down twice the number of juveniles and much more quickly than individuals who escape the parasitic invasion, the authors wrote.

The shrimps' awful parenting skills seem to be driven by muscle damage and a demand by the parasite for more food. Snacking on their own provides an easy meal for the shrimp and satisfies the parasite’s cravings, the researchers speculated.

“Nature is filled with parasitic horror stories,” noted Clive Shiff, a molecular microbiologist with Johns Hopkins Malaria Research Institute, who was not associated with the study.

For example, Shiff described one species of flatworm that annexes a particular species of snail, commandeering its tentacles and blinding it so it no longer tries to hide. Now easy prey, birds swoop down, biting off the mollusks’ heads. This allows the worm to develop into the adult stage inside the bird, Shiff explained.

Another parasite, known as a hairworm, targets grasshoppers, Shiff said, with the larva taking over control of the insect’s brain and nervous system. When the worm reaches adulthood it instructs the grasshopper to commit suicide by jumping into water and drowning itself. There the worm emerges to search for a mate.

The British authors stressed that their research does not suggest any link between the crustacean devastation they describe in their paper and human cannibalism -- though they do point out that over 300 species practice cannibalism, including humans."

And some things don’t change for at least 2 billion years.

An international team of scientists have identified a deep sea microorganism that has not evolved in at least two billion years, nearly half the age of the planet. It’s an important discovery that paradoxically provides some of the best support yet for Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution, said lead researcher J. William Schopf.

The findings were published in the latest issue of the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

“If evolution is as we understand it, organisms adapt to a changing environment,” explained Schopf, who is also a professor of earth, planetary and space sciences at the University of California in Los Angeles. “But if you take away any changes then there should be no evolution.”

Schopf said he had been searching since his freshman year of college, some 50 years ago, for a long-standing, durable environment that could help demonstrate the idea that absence of change would equal absence of evolution.

The team found living specimens of the tiny sulfur-eating bacteria in question off the coast of Western Australia far beneath the muddy sediment of the ocean floor. The organisms reside so far below the surface that no oxygen or light has ever reached them and they have never been disturbed by waves or other sea creatures, researchers said.

Using cutting-edge technology, the scientists were able to compare the microbes with a set of fossils preserved in rocks found in Western Australia’s coastal waters that date back 2.3 billion years ago, a point in the planet’s history when there was substantial rise in oxygen levels. Higher oxygen levels produced a dramatic spike in oxygen-containing sulfate and nitrate compounds that sunk to the bottom of the ocean, providing the “food” that allowed these bacteria to thrive and multiply.

They also match up exactly with fossils from 1.8 billion years ago found in the same area.

“They all look the same and they also look the same as other modern sulfur bacteria found in the mud off the coast of Chile,” Schopf said.

Charles Darwin focused mainly on how species changed over time in response to an ever-shifting environment, Schopf said. This discovery fits perfectly with Darwin’s theory of evolution because it demonstrates an organism that remained essentially unchanged over billions of years because it never had a reason to make adjustments.

“These microorganisms are well-adapted to their simple, very stable physical and biological environment,” Schopf said. “If they were in an environment that did not change but they nevertheless evolved, that would have shown that our understanding of Darwinian evolution was seriously flawed.”"

Police arrested Erich Nowsch on Thursday, accusing him of killing Tammy Meyers last week, and detailing how he allegedly confessed to his friends about his involvement in the shooting.

Here is a revised timeline of events surrounding the shooting:

Thursday, Feb. 12: Meyers' 15-year-old daughter told police she and her mother were on their way home from a driving lesson when they encountered someone near their house. In the apparent ""road rage"" incident, the driver got out of the car and said, ""I'm gonna come back for you and your daughter,"" according to a police complaint released Friday. Police have not said whether that person was Nowsch or a second suspect.

After Meyers, 44, and her daughter arrived home, Meyers' son Brandon, 22, ""told his mother to come in the house and call the police; but she told him no, come with me or I will go by myself,"" police said.

Authorities said the mother and son - who was armed - went out to search for the driver. The suspect then allegedly followed them home and shot Meyers in her driveway, according to police.

Earlier this week, police reported that the suspect fired first and Brandon Meyers returned fire.

Saturday, Feb. 14: Meyers died at the University Medical Center of Southern Nevada.

Tuesday, Feb. 17: Nowsch, the suspect in the shooting, was first questioned by police on Tuesday while he was in juvenile detention on an unrelated warrant, police said. While Nowsch did not match the physical description of the suspect, according to police, his alibi did not check out when he was questioned about her murder when his name was brought up in the investigation.

Nowsch denied involvement, police said.

Thursday, Feb. 19: After a two-hour standoff, Nowsch was arrested and charged with murder, attempted murder, and illegal discharge of a gun in connection with Meyers' death.

The shooting was initially described as a random incident, but Nowsch knew the Meyers family and lived one block away, according to Bob Meyers, Tammy Meyers' husband.

Meyers said his wife had spent ""countless hours"" at a park in their neighborhood, Ansan Sister City Park, ""consoling this boy.""

""She was really good to him,"" Meyers told reporters Thursday. ""She fed him, she gave him money, she told him to pull his pants up, and to be a man more times than I can count. But none of you knew this before because it would have hurt what these great Metro detectives were trying to accomplish.""

Police said they only learned of the relationship between the Meyers and Nowsch hours before his arrest.

""I couldn't tell you this before, he knew where I lived,"" Meyers said to the reporters, adding that he knew ""a few things"" about the case but couldn't divulge the information earlier.

According to information released by police Friday, a friend of Nowsch said the 19-year-old admitted to his involvement in a shooting. Nowsch said he thought people in the car were looking for him and thought he saw a gun, which prompted him to fire 22 times, police said.

Nowsch told them he ""got those kids, they were after me, and I got them,"" according to the complaint. He also said no one had fired at him.

Nowsch told his friend that someone had threatened his mother and her newborn, police said, and that ""if it gets heavy here he was going to Arizona.""

Police said they are looking for a second suspect, possibly the driver.

Nowsch's family has not returned an ABC News request for comment and his lawyers said they have not seen their client yet.

Nowsch is scheduled to make his first court appearance Monday."

Authorities say the mother and son searched for the driver, and that's when the suspect allegedly followed them home and shot Meyers in her driveway, according to police. Tammy Meyers died Saturday at the University Medical Center of Southern Nevada.

No words had been exchanged between the suspect and Brandon Meyers, according to police.

The suspect, Erich Nowsch Jr., 19, was first questioned on Tuesday, five days after the shooting, when he was in juvenile detention on an unrelated warrant. He did not match the physical description of the suspect, according to police, but his alibi didn't check out.

A friend of Nowsch says the suspect admitted to involvement in a shooting, according to police. Nowsch said he thought people in the car were looking for him and thought he saw a gun, which prompted him to shoot, police said.

Nowsch was arrested Thursday in connection with her death.

He has been charged with murder, attempted murder and illegal discharge of a gun. Nowsch will make his first appearance in court on Monday. His family has not returned an ABC News request for comment and Nowsch's lawyers said they have not seen their client yet.

Police said they are looking for a second suspect, possibly the driver."
1CX2dRh,2015-04-02 00:00:00,Al-Shabab: Who the Islamic Extremist Group Is and What They Want - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/International/al-shabab-islamic-extremist-group/story?id=30070182,"The Islamic extremist group Al-Shabab has claimed responsibility for an attack on a Kenyan college early in the morning on April 2. That attack left at least 147 students dead and hundreds of others unaccounted for, according to Kenyan officials. The Somalia-based militant organization raided Garissa College, located in the eastern part of Kenya. So what is Al-Shabab and what do they want?

Al-Shabab translates to “the Youth” in Arabic.

In 2008, the United States government designated the Somalia-based organization as a terrorist group. The U.S. alleged it was made up of a ""number of individuals affiliated with al Qaeda"" and some senior leaders who have trained and fought with al Qaeda in Afghanistan. Al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri announced a formal alliance between the two groups in February 2012.

Kenya: 147 Killed in Attack on College

Al-Shabab first formed in the mid-2000s in Somalia, a country that has suffered from a weak government and internal fighting for more than two decades.

What is the group known for?

Al-Shabab is arguably best known to Americans for the September 2013 attack on the Westgate Mall in Kenya’s capital, Nairobi. Four gunmen entered the mall, killing 67 people during what became a four-day siege.

During the attack, the fighters spared Muslims, while killing those unable to recite verses from the Koran.
The Mall was seen as a symbol as Kenya’s increased prosperity and connection to western nations. Five stories high with glass elevators and sushi and yogurt shops, the mall housed expensive shops and was frequented by expatriates.

Al-Shabab has also claimed responsibility for several other deadly terror attacks in the region, including the 2010 bombing in Uganda that killed more than 70 people, among them a 25-year-old American, who had gathered to watch the World Cup on large-screen TVs. In 2011, the group bombed several tourist destinations in northern Kenya.

What has the U.S. done in response?

Over the past two years, the United States has conducted drone strikes to eliminate leaders of Al-Shabab.

In March 2015, a U.S. drone strike killed the Al-Shabab leader who allegedly planned the Westgate Mall attack. A Pentagon statement described the killing of Adnan Garar as a “significant blow to the Al-Shabab terrorist organization.”

In December 2014, the Al-Shabab intelligence chief, Emir Ahmed Abdi Godane, was killed in a drone strike. In September 2014, a drone strike killed Ahmed Gobane, Al-Shabab’s co-founder.

In October 2013, just a month after the Westgate attack, the Pentagon said Al-Shabab’s lead explosives expert, Ibrahim Ali, was also killed in a drone strike.

What does Al-Shabab want?

Al-Shabab’s goals vary. As the group was forcibly pushed out of major urban areas in Somalia, analysts say it suffered its own political infighting about its long-term goals -- the group fractured between those who wanted to focus on taking back Somalia and those who dreamed of international jihad.

A hint of that struggle was revealed in an oddly public spat between Al-Shabab's leadership and one of its highest-profile American members, the rapping jihadist Omar Hammami. Hammami was reportedly killed by rivals in Al-Shabab last week. Months before he had released an online video in which he said he feared for his life after arguing with the leadership ""regarding matters of the Sharia [Islamic law] and matters of strategy."""

The total lunar eclipse set to take over the skies on Saturday will be the shortest in a century, lasting five minutes and turning the moon red, according to NASA.

The sky spectacle will be visible from all parts of the United States, with people in the eastern part of the country seeing the beginning stages of the partial umbral eclipse before sunrise at 6:16 ET.

The total eclipse will be visible to people in the Western United States at 4:58 PT. At this time, the moon will turn a shade of blood red as it skims the outskirts of Earth's shadow.

The eclipse is the third in a tetrad, a series of four eclipses. The fourth is set for Sept. 28, 2015.

The best part of all for Saturday's phenomenon: No telescope is needed. If you're in an area with visibility, all you'll need to do is step outside to enjoy the view -- that is, if you can catch it in time."

Asa Hutchinson has asked his state's legislature to alter a religious-freedom bill sent to his desk before he will sign it.

""I ask that changes be made in the legislature, and I've asked that the leaders of the General Assembly to recall the bill so that it can be amended to reflect the terms of the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act,"" Hutchinson said.

The governor noted that the bill applies to corporations and litigation between private citizens or entities, neither of which are included in the federal law signed by Bill Clinton.

""We want to be known as a state that does not discriminate but understands tolerance,"" Hutchinson said, referencing the controversy around Indiana's law.

Hutchinson pointed out that his own son signed a petition asking him to veto the bill. He also said a debate will continue over whether to add protections against discrimination based on sexual orientation to the state's laws or constitution, either through the state legislature or through a popular vote.

Passed Tuesday by the state legislature, the law is similar to the one Indiana Gov. Mike Pence signed last week, sparking a national wave of backlash from businesses, pro-gay-rights activists, and the NCAA.

Similar pressure has been brought to bear on Hutchinson in Arkansas, as Walmart CEO Doug McMillon urged Hutchinson via Twitter on Tuesday to veto the bill, saying it violated the ""spirit of inclusion"" in Arkansas. Walmart is headquartered in Arkansas. The Little Rock Chamber of Commerce and Little Rock Democratic Mayor Mark Stodola have also urged Hutchinson to veto the bill.

Like Indiana's SB 101, the Arkansas's HB 1228 states that the government must prove a higher standard of government interest in enforcing laws that infringe on the free exercise of a person's religion. Like the law in Indiana, the law in Arkansas applies to corporations, and opponents have warned that the bill would allow businesses to deny services to gays or lesbians.

After the wave of controversy over Indiana's bill, Pence appeared Tuesday to say he would support a change to the law that would make it clear businesses would not be allowed to deny services to gays and lesbians.

Similar legislation is on the books in a total of 20 states, although only Indiana's and South Carolina's laws apply to corporations. A federal law was signed by President Bill Clinton; that law was proposed after a Supreme Court ruling against two Native Americans who defended their taking of peyote on religious grounds."

Christian Flagella, the commander of the gendarmerie police force in the Haute Alpes region, said at a news conference today that the three individuals were part of a larger group of 11 skiers.

Four members of the group were swept away by the avalanche, and three are now dead. A fourth remains in critical condition.

The names and ages of the individuals have not been released.

Local official Pierre Besnard told reporters that the group was ""most likely Austrians but we are waiting to interrogate the survivors to know for sure.""

The specific area of the avalanche has not been confirmed, but an employee at a nearby chalet told ABC News that the area is known for off-piste skiing, meaning that there are no official slopes, but adventurous skiers have to hike up the mountain in order to ski down. The area has also received heavy snow for the past two days.

This would be the second tragedy in the mountain range in just eight days after a Germanwings flight crashed killing all 150 on board."
1Cxrcex,2015-02-05 00:00:00,Investigators Want to Know Why Woman Drove Onto Tracks - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/US/metro-north-service-resumes-amid-investigation-deadly-collision/story?id=28742328,"The engineer of the Metro-North train that crashed into an SUV earlier this week told investigators he saw the car moving onto the tracks seconds before impact.

The National Transportation Safety Board concluded their first full day investigating the crash that left six dead, including the driver of the SUV and five passengers on the train.

NTSB vice chairman Robert Sumwalt said that they have not yet spoken to the train conductor. The engineer, who was interviewed today, said he activated the emergency brake, which prompted the horn to sound for four seconds before the train hit the Mercedes SUV.

The train was travelling at 58 miles per hour - just shy of the area's 60 m.p.h. limit - and took 950 feet to stop.

Officials today examined physical evidence at the scene and units that recorded train and car signals -- but they say they can't get away from a question at the core of the case: Why would an SUV driver pull forward into the path of an oncoming train?

""We're going to do everything we can to try and understand that key fact: Why was that car stopped on the tracks?"" National Transportation Safety Board vice chairman Robert Sumwalt said today.

A motorist who said he was in the car behind Ellen Brody, 49, a mother of three, told ABC News after Tuesday's accident that he even backed up to allow Brody to get out of harm's way.

""I’m waiting for her to back up and she moves forward,"" Rick Hope said. ""And she moves forward probably 15 feet right in front of the train. She looked very calm and she took what I thought was an awful long time because I’m thinking the clock is ticking here. The lights are flashing, the gate’s down, you don’t have much time. And I didn’t know what to do. I indicated that I was backing up ... but she looked at me -- I know she did. She got in and all I can imagine is she was trying to make it to the other side.""

Metro-North train service resumed this morning at the site of Tuesday’s deadly collision that killed Brody and five passengers.

Service had been shut down in the area around the crash site, which happened near Valhalla on the service’s Harlem Line.

Some 400 feet of the electrified third rail sliced through the train’s first car following the collision, burning the interior of the car and killing five passengers, Sumwalt said Wednesday.

Brody's Mercedes SUV was ""pushed about 1,000 feet down the tracks"" and ""during that time, the third rail penetrated"" the first passenger cabin of the train, NTSB vice chairman Robert Sumwalt said. The third rail, which supplies power to the train, began breaking apart in 80-foot segments that started to pile up in the first cabin, but a section also went into the second car as well.

Sumwalt said that the crash caused a fire and explosion, and ""initial indications are that the fire was fueled by gasoline from the SUV."" It was not immediately clear how long the power stayed on when the rail entered the train car, but the NTSB said the rail is designed to deactivate if it is separated.

Sumwalt said that NTSB investigators will likely stay in the area for five to seven days collecting witness testimony and what he classified as ""perishable"" evidence, meaning information that may disappear or disintegrate over time. They have already downloaded the recorders that are in place on the tracks and are calling on witnesses to come forward and share any information they have about the fatal crash.

Co-workers identified the driver of the SUV as Ellen Brody, a mother of three from Edgemont, New York. Among the dead on the train were Joseph Nadol, 42, of Ossining, New York, Robert Dirks, 36, of Chappaqua, New York, Walter Liedtke, 69, and Eric Vandercar, 53, of Bedford Hills, New York, and Aditya Tomar, 41, of Danbury, Connecticut.

Westchester County Executive Rob Astorino, speaking Wednesday, said that all but one of those killed were charred beyond recognition.

“That train had so many flames in it, it was so engulfed, the inside of that first car is just melted and charred,"" Astorino said.

Relatives of the victims were shaken by the tragedy. Brody’s husband, Alan, reflected about his wife’s death in a Facebook post.

“Thank you to those who shared their condolences for the terrible tragedy that took my beloved wife, Ellen,” he wrote.

Bob Menendez said he's ""outraged"" by federal corruption charges he's facing stemming from his interactions with a Florida eye doctor.

""For nearly three years, I’ve lived under a Justice Department cloud, and today, I’m outraged that this cloud has not been lifted,"" Menendez said at a news conference in Newark, New Jersey, Wednesday night. ""I am confident at the end of the day I will be vindicated.""

""This is not how my career is going to end,"" Menendez said. ""I'm angry and ready to fight because today contradicts my public service career and my entire life.""

In a short news conference, Menendez maintained his innocence, saying his actions adhered to the law.

“Prosecutors don’t know the difference between friendship and corruption,"" Menendez added.

Menendez, D-New Jersey, along with Dr. Salomon Melgen, is charged with one count of conspiracy, one count of violating the travel act, eight counts of bribery and three counts of honest services fraud.

Menendez was also charged with one count of making false statements.

The Department of Justice filed the charges in the District of New Jersey.

The charges center on Menendez’s relationship with Melgen, who is a close Menendez ally and donor to the New Jersey senator, in connection with a bribery scheme in which the senator allegedly accepted gifts from Melgen in exchange for using the power of his Senate office to benefit the doctor's financial and personal interests.

The indictment includes allegations Menendez accepted close to $1 million worth of gifts and campaign contributions from Melgen between 2006 and 2013 in exchange for advocating on the behalf of the doctor, saying the senator ""used the prestige, authority and influence of his status as a United States Senator to promote Melgen’s personal and business interests.”

Some of the gifts cited in the indictment include flights on Melgen’s private jet, vacations to the Dominican Republic, and $40,000 in contributions to his legal defense fund. Melgen also donated over $750,000 in campaign contributions. Menendez did not report the gifts Melgen provided on any financial disclosure forms.

The indictment also alleges the New Jersey senator used his position and his staff to advocate for Melgen’s interests, including stepping in in a legal dispute involving approximately $8.9 million of Medicare overbilling by Melgen and supporting visa applications for Melgen’s girlfriends.

Last month, the New Jersey Democrat denied any wrongdoing as the Department of Justice weighed issuing criminal charges against him.

“Let me be very clear, very clear. I have always conducted myself appropriately and in accordance with the law,” Menendez said.

Menendez is the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and has been at the forefront of many of the Senate’s recent foreign policy fights. Menendez, who is of Cuban descent, is a fierce opponent of President Obama’s decision to normalize relations with Cuba. The New Jersey senator is also leading efforts to impose new sanctions on Iran if nuclear negotiators fail reach to deal – a move that has put him at odds with the White House.

Menendez plans on temporarily stepping down as ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, a source with knowledge of the decision told ABC News.

Menendez is the 12th senator to be indicted while still serving in the Senate.

The last senator to be indicted was Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, who faced criminal charges due to not reporting hundreds of thousands of dollars in services he received during the renovation of his home. Stevens was convicted in 2008 but in 2009, a federal judge dismissed the conviction."

Police charged Jamyra Gallmon, 21, with first-degree felony murder while armed in connection with the death of David Messerschmitt. His body was found inside a room at the Donovan Hotel on Feb. 10.

Messerschmitt, 30, had sent a text message to his wife the day before his body was discovered, saying he'd be home in an hour, said police. But when the newlywed didn't return to his home in Capitol Hill, his wife, Kim Vuong, filed a missing persons report.

Police didn't say what evidence led investigators to charge Gallmon but said they believe she was pictured in a surveillance video released by police.

The suspect is expected to make an appearance in court on Thursday.

Last week, Vuong asked for help finding her husband's alleged killer, saying she had lost her ""husband and best friend.""

The accident, which happened during the Tuesday night commuter rush near Valhalla in suburban New York, was caused by the train hitting a Mercedes SUV that, ""for whatever reason,"" was on the tracks, NTSB vice chairman Robert Sumwalt said.

The car was ""pushed about 1,000 feet down the tracks"" and ""during that time, the third rail penetrated"" the first passenger cabin of the train, Sumwalt said. The third rail, which supplies power to the train, began breaking apart in 80-foot segments which started to pile up in the first cabin, but a section also went into the second car as well.

It was not immediately clear how long the power stayed on when the rail entered the train car, but the NTSB said the rail is designed to deactivate if it is separated.

Sumwalt said that the NTSB investigators, who arrived this morning at the crash site about 20 miles north of Manhattan, will likely stay in the area for the next five to seven days collecting witness testimony and what he classified as ""perishable"" evidence, meaning information that may disappear or disintegrate over time.

They have already downloaded the recorders that are in place on the tracks and are calling on witnesses to come forward and share any information they have about the fatal crash.

Earlier today, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo spoke about the tragedy. “There are six people who left home and said ‘goodbye honey’ and never came back,” he said. He called the accident a “truly ugly and brutal sight.”

Co-workers later identified the driver of the car as Ellen Brody, a mother of three from Edgemont, New York. Among the dead on the train were Joseph Nadol, 42, of Ossining, Robert Dirks, 36, of Chappaqua, Walter Liedtke of Bedford Hills, Eric Vandercar, 53, of Bedford Hills, and Aditya Tomar, 41, of Danbury, Connecticut.

Cuomo added that the electrified third rail of the track buckled and pierced the front train car.

“You had a metal rail going right down the train like a ramrod,” Cuomo said. “That’s what caused massive destruction.”

Twelve people injured in the crash were taken to Westchester Medical Center -- and as of early this afternoon, one was in critical condition, one was in serious condition, four were fair, two were good and four had been discharged, hospital officials said. Injuries included lacerations, contusions, crush injuries, fractures, smoke inhalation and burns.

Westchester County Executive Rob Astorino said today that all but one of those killed were charred beyond recognition. Families were gathering around 10 a.m. at the medical examiner’s office to make positive identifications, but Astorino believed medical and dental records would be needed.

“That train had so many flames in it, it was so engulfed, the inside of that first car is just melted and charred,"" Astorino said.

Citing an eyewitness quoted by local media, Astorino said the preliminary, unconfirmed indication was that the railroad crossing gate came down on the vehicle involved in the accident, the female driver got out to put the gate up, and then she drove forward instead of in reverse and into the path of the oncoming train. He noted that traffic may have been backed up in the area because of another accident on the Taconic State Parkway.

Cuomo told ABC News in a radio interview that “it would be apparently inexplicable” if the driver pulled forward onto the track and into the path of the oncoming train.

“If there’s a lesson to learn we’ll learn it,” Cuomo said. “But sometimes accidents happen and human beings can act randomly.”

Initially, officials reported the car involved in the accident was a Jeep SUV, but they later said it was a Mercedes.

The National Transportation Safety Board launched a go-team to investigate the accident, which is the deadliest tragedy in the history of the railroad.

NTSB board member Robert Sumwalt said this morning that officials have secured event recorders for the train itself, as well as for train and highway signals near the crash, and the agency has sent experts to analyze the recorders. The NTSB team also includes technical experts who can examine areas such as track and highway factors, emergency response and fire science. The NTSB expects to gather evidence at the scene for five to seven days, starting with the most perishable evidence, for an investigation that could last a year.

“Our goal is not only to find what happened, but to find out why it happened,” Sumwalt said. ""We go there and we cast a wide net. ... At this point, everything is on the table. Nothing is off the table.”

Angelo Ortiz, one of the first paramedics on the scene, had trouble putting the accident into context hours afterwards.

""What I first saw was the glow of the fire down the road. And as I approached I was in disbelief when I saw the fire was coming from the car that was completely engulfed. When I knew it was the train that was on fire as well, that's when I realized that this is probably the worst tragedy I've ever responded to,"" Ortiz said.

""It was incredibly, just very tragic. That's all I can say. I'm still in disbelief,""

Rick Hope, a driver who said he saw the train hit the SUV, said he saw the events preceding the accident that Astorino and other officials described.

“She looked very calm and she was taking what I thought was an awful long time because I'm thinking, ‘The clock is ticking here.’ The lights are flashing. The gate's down. You don't have much time,” Hope told ABC News.

""She cut me in my stomach,"" the victim, identified by her family as Michelle Wilkins, is heard saying on the call. ""I'm afraid.""

Wilkins goes on to say the suspect used a knife and broken glass during the attack. Police say the woman did not know the suspect prior to answering the ad.

Wilkins identifies herself during the call but the Longmont Police Department redacted that portion to keep her name private. She does say she is 26-years-old and seven months pregnant.

Wilkins is able to relay the address of the home during the call and emergency responders are heard arriving at the end of the more than six-minute call. Police say the suspect used the ad to lure the pregnant woman there.

Wilkins was rushed to a nearby hospital and Boulder District Attorney Stan Garnett said at a news conference this afternoon she is ""doing much better than they feared she'd do"" and is expected to make a full recovery.

Her family released a statement tonight, thanking the public ""for the outpouring of sympathy and support.""

""We grieve for the many victims of this senseless attack, but mostly for a precious child whose life was ended before she had a chance to live,"" read the statement from Wilkins' family.

The suspect, identified in arrest records as Dynel Catrece Lane, was arrested after she and her husband arrived at the local hospital seven hours after the victim's 911 call with the dead child, saying that she had had a miscarriage, authorities say.

The Associated Press confirmed that Lane made her first court appearance today and was advised of the charges against her. Her bail was set at $2 million.

Lane has not had to enter a plea and the Associated Press reports that her lawyer has asked for an expert to be present while the state performs an autopsy, scheduled for Friday, on the baby. The results of the autopsy may determine if Lane faces a homicide charge."

Adrian Thomas Loya of the Coast Guard was apprehended by police in Bourne, Massachusetts, and now faces eight charges including murder, armed assault with intent to murder and home invasion.

Loya's attorney Drew Segadelli confirmed to ABC News that his client knew at least one of the women that he allegedly shot but would not elaborate any further.

The identities of his victims have not been released, but the District Attorney for the Cape and Islands confirmed that Loya and the two women he allegedly attacked were members of the Coast Guard.

The two women were stationed near Bourne but Loya was stationed in Virginia. It was not clear what his relationship was with either of the women but Bourne police told ABC News that they did not believe it was a random crime.

""Today the Coast Guard family suffered a tragic loss,"" said Rear Adm. Linda Fagan, commander of the First Coast Guard District.

Bourne police were called at 2:14 a.m. to respond to a car fire in the area and when they arrived, they ""observed a fully engulfed automobile,"" according to the district attorney's statement.

While assessing the burning vehicle which was parked so that it blocked a residential road, another emergency call came in reporting shots being fired at a nearby residence.

As the police headed towards the residence, a man started firing at them and one of the officers was shot in the back.

The other responding officer went to the residence and found one dead woman and another who had been injured. She was transported to a Rhode Island hospital for treatment.

Another group of officers found the male suspect, identified later today as Loya, at a third nearby location and took him into custody.

""It certainly was an ambush of the police officers and it was a home invasion with respect to the two adult females,"" District Attorney Michael O'Keefe said at a press conference this morning.

""Our officer is doing well. He was transported to a hospital in Rhode Island. He already underwent surgery. We understand his condition is improving,"" Bourne Police Chief Dennis Woodside said, according to ABC affiliate WCVB.

Loya faces charges of murder, two counts of armed assault with intent to murder, two counts of home invasion, burglary armed assault, arson of a motor vehicle and assault and battery of a police officer.

He is being held without bail and will appear in court on March 23.

Denise Huskins was found in Huntington Beach, California, this morning, police said. Her father, Mike Huskins, told ABC News that his daughter called him from Huntington Beach to say she was safe.

Police in Vallejo, California, said the investigation into Huskins' alleged kidnapping is ""still active."" Investigators had not yet spoken with her but hoped to do so today.

Police say Huskins was abducted from the home where she was staying in Vallejo, California, hours earlier, at about 3:30 a.m.

The home from where Huskins was reportedly taken belongs to 30-year-old Aaron Quinn, ABC News has learned. Huskins' family describes him as her boyfriend and co-worker and says he is the man who called 911 hours after her abduction.

Police have said that Quinn is not a suspect in the case. Huntington Beach, where Huskins was found, is about 419 miles from Vallejo.

Authorities in Vallejo held a news conference earlier today in which they said there was a “ransom demand” and described Huskins as being forcibly abducted from her home.

The San Francisco Chronicle today revealed the contents of an email it says it received Tuesday from an ""anonymous person claiming to be holding Denise Huskins.""

The newspaper reports the email said that Huskins ""will be returned safely (Wednesday)"" and that ""any advance on us or our associates will create a dangerous situation for Denise.""

The e-mail was also reported to include an audio file of a woman identifying herself as Huskins who referred to Tuesday’s plane crash in southern France and identified the first concert she had attended in her life, the name of a childhood friend she attended the concert with, and the name of the friend's mother as proof of her identity.

Police in Vallejo said they received the same email and audio file but did not confirm its contents.

“That was her. The tape recording was her. That I know. They said they were going to drop her off and they did,” Mike Huskins told the Chronicle after being played the audio recording. “I’m relieved. You have to expect the worst — but in my heart, I knew she was still alive."""
1D129j3,2015-02-03 00:00:00,Why Even Vaccinated People Can Catch Measles - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Health/vaccinated-people-catch-measles/story?id=28631939,"A measles outbreak that started last December has infected at least 84 people in 14 states, including at least 5 people who were immunized against the virus.

Those five known vaccinated people were all residents of California where many counties are below the 92 percent vaccination rate required for ""herd immunity"" threshold, according to state health department.

Herd immunity or community immunity is when a critical portion of the community is immunized against a contagious disease, resulting in less chance of an outbreak, according to the National Institutes of Health.

Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, said herd immunity is important because no vaccine can perfectly protect 100 percent of people.

""If everyone else is vaccinated, then the weak are protected, because they are surrounded with a cocoon of protection of others,"" Schaffner said. ""The herd of strong protect the few weak.""

To protect against measles, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends doses of two MMR (Measles, Mumps, Rubella) shots that will provide 99 percent protection. A single dose will protect 95 percent of people from the virus.

However, measles is one of the most infectious viruses in existence. It will infect 90 percent of susceptible people if they are exposed. The airborne virus can also remain in the air for hours, infecting people if they are in the same vicinity as someone who is ill. For every person who gets it, the virus can spread to 18 other people.

Schaffner said the fact that even a few people who were vaccinated have become infected shows how many people have been exposed to the virus.

""For every person who's vaccinated who comes down with measles you can assume that between 40 to 80 people who were exposed,"" said Schaffner.

The measles virus was declared eradicated from the U.S. in 2000 and reached an all time low with 37 cases in 2004. However, cases of the virus have started to increase due to ""clusters"" of unvaccinated people and increased international travel. Last year 644 people were infected with the disease in the U.S.

Mills joined director Laura Poitras, producer Dirk Wilutzky and journalist Glenn Greenwald onstage.

Snowden was charged under the federal Espionage Act and is currently living in asylum in Russia. Because of the sensitive nature of the footage, Poitras made ""Citizenfour"" under intense secrecy and edited it in Germany.

""Thank you to Edward Snowden for his courage, and for the many other whistleblowers, and I share this with Glenn Greenwald and other journalists who are exposing truth,"" Poitras said when accepting the award.

Oscars host Neil Patrick Harris mentioned Snowden as Poitras and her collaborators walked offstage.

""The subject of 'Citizenfour,' Edward Snowden, could not be here tonight for some treason,"" Harris said.

Snowden released a statement through the American Civil Liberties Union, congratulating Poitras on the Oscars win.

“When Laura Poitras asked me if she could film our encounters, I was extremely reluctant,” the statement read. “I’m grateful that I allowed her to persuade me. The result is a brave and brilliant film that deserves the honor and recognition it has received. My hope is that this award will encourage more people to see the film and be inspired by its message that ordinary citizens, working together, can change the world.”

“Citizenfour” beat out four other documentary films: “Virunga,” “Last Days of Vietnam,” “The Salt of the Earth” and “Finding Vivian Maier.”

On Jan. 27, Brown was driving a Jeep with her friend Danyela Da Silva Bradley as passenger, while the other vehicle involved in the crash was a Ford Taurus, according to the report.

Brown, 21, lost control of her Jeep and crossed over into the lanes running in the opposite direction, then collided with the Taurus, the report said.

The report adds that both the driver of the Taurus Russell Eckerman and Brown's passenger were taken to North Fulton Hospital due to injuries suffered from the crash.

In an exclusive statement to ABC News, Russell's mother, Bert Eckerman, said of the accident, ""Russell is a great, caring son, and this was a terrible tragedy. He was on his way to work when he was met with this tragic incident. Please respect our privacy as we pray and wait for Russ to heal.”

The Eckerman's lawyer, Alan Herman, added, ""I have known the Eckerman family for the past 33 years and am very sorry that this incident has occurred. Russell used to babysit for my children when they were youngsters. Russell was on his way to work when this incident occurred. He has been hospitalized since the date of the occurrence and has been unable to speak. His medical condition as I understand it, is serious, but everyone is hopeful that he will recover and get back to being Russell.""

Roswell Police told ABC News the accident is still under investigation and will not comment on it further.

Brown, the daughter of pop icons Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown, has been in the hospital since she was discovered by her partner Nick Gordon and a friend Max Lomas on Jan. 31, according to police. Lomas has been previous linked to Bradley, Brown's passenger in the accident days earlier.

Brown was found face down in her bath tub and was taken to North Fulton Hospital, but then moved to Emory University Hospital.

Roswell Police also confirmed that Brown's incident at her home less than two weeks ago is classified as a criminal investigation. That has always been the case, a spokesperson said in a statement on Wednesday.

""The Roswell Police Criminal Investigation Division, who is investigating the incident, conducts criminal investigations,"" Lisa Holland, the Roswell public information officer, said in a statement to ABC News. ""The incident has always been under criminal investigation and has not been reclassified as a criminal investigation. Criminal investigations may or may not result in criminal charges being brought against individuals.""

Brown has been surrounded by friends and family, including her father, who has continued to ask for privacy while they monitor her condition.

""God is hearing our prayers,"" Brown told ABC News in a statement. ""We continue to request privacy in this matter. We thank everyone that supported the vigil for Bobbi Kristina.""

Her partner, Nick Gordon, issued a statement through his attorneys, saying that ""he remains in constant prayer for his companion and he hopes to be reunited with her soon.""

The Houston family has added that she's ""fighting for her life.""

This past Monday night, a public ""Shining a Light for Healing"" vigil was held in her honor in nearby Riverdale, Georgia, where several hundred people attended to pray for Brown."

Cynthia Cheroitich, 19, told The Associated Press from her hospital gurney that she hid in a large cupboard and covered herself with clothes, refusing to emerge even when some of her classmates came out of hiding at the demands of the gunmen from the al-Shabab group.

She was rescued shortly before 10 a.m., according to Kenyan officials.

Cheroitich said she didn't believe that rescuers urging her to come out of her hiding place were there to help, suspecting at first that they were militants.

""How do I know that you are the Kenyan police?"" she said she asked them.

Only when Kenyan security forces had one of her teachers appeal to her did she come out, she said.

""I was just praying to my God,"" Cheroitich, a Christian, said of her ordeal.

Cheroitich appeared tired and thirsty, sipping on yoghurt and a soft drink, but otherwise seemed in good health.

She said she drank a lotion because she was so thirsty and hungry while in hiding.

The good news that Cheroitich survived the attack came as grieving Kenyans gathered in Nairobi to view the bodies of family members killed in the Garissa attack.

Five people have been arrested on suspicion of involvement in the Garissa attack, a Kenyan official said.

Kenyan security agencies arrested three people trying to cross into Somalia, said Interior Ministry spokesman Mwenda Njoka in a Twitter post. He said the three are associates of Mohamed Mohamud, also known as Dulyadin Gamadhere, a former teacher at a Kenyan Madrassa Islamic school who authorities say coordinated the Garissa attack. Kenyan authorities have put a $220,000 bounty for information leading to Gamadhere's arrest.

The three arrests brings to five the number of suspects arrested in relation to the Garissa attack as two suspects were arrested at the college.

Al-Shabab on Saturday warned of more attacks in Kenya like the assault on Garissa University College, according to the SITE intelligence monitoring group,

The Islamic militant group issued a statement which said the attack on Garissa college was in retaliation for killings carried out by Kenyan troops fighting the rebels in Somalia.

The attack on the college in northeastern Kenya on Thursday killed 148 people.

""No amount of precaution of safety measures will be able to guarantee your safety, thwart another attack or prevent another bloodbath,"" said the statement.

""Kenyan cities will run red with blood ... This will be a long, gruesome war of which you, the Kenyan public, are its first casualties,"" said the statement, issued on Shabab affiliated webites and Twitter accounts."

""Officers are working closely with the Turkish authorities who are providing a great deal of assistance and support to our investigation,” a Scotland Yard spokesman told the BBC.

The three girls -- Shamima Begum, 15, and her friends Amira Abase, 15, and Kadiza Sultana, 16 -- were all last seen Tuesday morning when they boarded a flight from London's Gatwick airport headed for Turkey. From there, police believe they made their way to Syria to join the Islamic fighters.

While their classmates head back to school at Bethnal Green Academy after a week-long vacation, the school's principal worked to reassure other parents that the school was handling the situation.

""We are all shocked and deeply saddened by the news that three of our students have been reported missing from home,"" school principal Mark Keary said to the BBC.

""This situation follows an earlier disappearance of a student in December of last year. The police spoke to the student's friends at that time and, further to this, they indicated that there was no evidence that the girls were at risk of being radicalized or absconding.""

The girls' relatives have been making emotional pleas to get them home.

""If you're watching this, baby, please come home,"" said Renu Begum, an older sister of one of the missing girls, Shamima Begum.

""Mum needs you more than anything in the world. You’re our baby and we just want you home, we want you safe. Just contact anybody let them know that you need help,"" Renu Begum told the BBC.

""You've got all the help in the world you're not in any trouble here, we all love you. If anybody's convinced you of anything then they're wrong. We love you more than anybody that could ever love you,"" Begum said.

Renu Begum remembered asking her sister about that at the time, saying, ""You wouldn't do something stupid like that would you?""

Abase Hussen, the father of missing girl Amira Abase, told the BBC his daughter told him she was going to a wedding when she left the family home.

A relative of the third missing girl, Kadiza Sultana, said ""everyone's hurting... especially mum.""

""Find the courage in your heart to contact us and let us know that you're safe and you're OK,"" the relative said.

Police in New Britain have assured the public the ""threat is over,"" but the suspects remain at large, according to law enforcement sources.

The mayor and police chief held a news conference this afternoon but left many questions unanswered because the investigation is ongoing.

The situation unfolded in the early hours today when two men allegedly broke into a home in Bristol, strapped an elderly woman to a bed with a device they claimed was explosive.

Police say the two suspects then strapped another such device to the woman's son, who lived with her and who worked as a manager of the local Achieve Financial Credit Union. The suspects then forced the man to drive to the credit union, threatening to explode the device under his mother's bed if he did not comply.

At some point during the drive, sources told ABC News, the man was able to call his colleagues and alert them to what was happening. They, in turn, were able to call police, who swarmed the credit union before his arrival. The suspects escaped and the man and is mother were uninjured, officials said.

The devices were removed from them and the scenes were secured by officials. It was unclear whether the devices were actually explosives, and the FBI was running more tests.

New Britain Mayor Erin Stewart called it a ""very fluid and dangerous situation"" but thanked the various law enforcement agencies involved, as well as residents who were called to evacuate their homes.

Police have confirmed to ABC News that they are actively searching for ""more than one"" suspect."

""Congratulations to Eddie Redmayne for winning an Oscar for playing me in The Theory of Everything Movie. Well done Eddie, I'm very proud of you. -SH,"" he wrote.

Hawking, 73, who has a motor neuron disease and is almost entirely paralyzed, relies on technology and that famous computer-generated voice to allow him to share his thoughts with the world. His system got a modern upgrade from Intel engineers in December, which Hawking showed off at a London event.

Intel said it was able to increase the efficiency of Hawking's system by integrating predictive text technology from SwiftKey. The software knows Hawking's communication patterns, meaning he has to type less than 20 percent of all characters to convey what he wants to say.

The result is a system that allows Hawking to type faster, browse the Internet much easier and seamlessly switch between tasks.

Hawking's existing cheek sensor syncs with a switch on his glasses, allowing him to choose characters he wishes to type, which can then be processed by his speech synthesizer and spoken out loud from his Lenovo laptop.

Intel said it planned to make the technology available for free, allowing researchers and technologists to build on the software and tailor it in different ways that could help the more than 3 million people worldwide who have motor neuron disease or quadriplegia better communicate."

Here are the top five things we'll always remember when we look back at Sunday's game:

1. Tom Brady Joins Pantheon of Iconic Quarterbacks

Like him or not, Brady might have just cemented his legacy as the greatest postseason quarterback of all time -- winning his fourth Super Bowl and third Super Bowl MVP award.

Brady overcame two interceptions to lead the Patriots to their fourth championship since becoming the team's starting quarterback in 2001. Brady now becomes the third quarterback -- along with Pittsburgh's Terry Bradshaw and San Francisco's Joe Montana -- to win four titles.

Brady guided the Pats Sunday night with 328 yards passing yards and four touchdowns.

2. Pushing, Shoving Mars End of Game

With emotions running high after an exciting two minutes in the fourth quarter, the final 18 seconds of the game turned into a wrestling match between the teams.

Here's what happened: With the Patriots leading 28-24 (which would end up being the final score), the Seahawks were on the move and got to New England's 1-yard line. Patriots' rookie Malcolm Butler intercepted Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson to preserve the Patriots' four-point lead and essentially end the game.

The Patriots attempted to run out the clock with 18 seconds left by taking a knee, but Seattle tried to push through the line. Punches were thrown as players began to push and shove each other.

Seahawks linebacker Bruce Irvin was ejected as the Pats ran out the clock for the win.

3. Pete Carroll, What Were You Thinking?

With the Patriots leading in the final minutes of the game, Wilson and the Seahawks ripped through the Patriots defense. The Seahawks' Jermaine Kearse made a juggling, 33-yard catch while on his back with a little over a minute in the game that got Seattle to New England's 5-yard line -- one of the best catches ever in a Super Bowl.

Seattle running back Marshawn Lynch picked up four more yards, bringing the Seahawks to the 1-yard line with just seconds left. Instead of handing the ball off to Lynch again, Seahawks head coach Pete Carroll decided to pass and Wilson was picked off -- bringing Seattle's chances of back-to-back championships to an end.

""For it to come down to a play like that, I hate that we have to live with that,"" Carroll said after the game.

Worse call in NFL History. Pete Carroll will never recover from this. Give the damn ball to MarShawn Lynch. Horrible! Horrible! Horrible!

4. Katy Perry Roars Into the Halftime Show

Katy Perry kicked off the halftime show by entering the University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, by riding in on an enormous lion.

The performance featured guest appearances by Lenny Kravitz and Missy Elliott. Perry ended the show by going airborne on a shooting star while singing ""Firework.""

5. Buzzy Commercials

This year's commercials ranged from the tragic to the weird, mixed in with plenty of animals.

Here are some of the highs and lows:

Insurance giant Nationwide was lambasted for airing a commercial of a little boy who ""couldn't grow up"" because he he died in a household accident.

The NFL aired a domestic violence PSA following some high-profile incidents this season.

Along with 13 others, including “Dodo la Saumure” -- la Saumure being slang for pimp -- Strauss-Kahn, 65, will stand trial for “aggravated pimping as part of a group,” for his alleged involvement in the so-called ""Carlton Affair” prostitution ring. The case has all the trappings of a salacious political thriller, and the name refers to a hotel in the French city of Lille, where, allegedly, some of the orgies took place.

While paying for sex is not illegal in France, Strauss-Kahn is accused of using his high-level contacts to hire hookers for sex parties in Paris, Washington and Lille, which is a crime. DSK, as he’s known in France, arrived in the Lille courthouse Monday.

Christopher Mesnooh, a lawyer for Field Fisher Waterhouse law firm, described the charges to the Associated Press: ""On the basic charge, which is being brought against the majority of defendants, which is aggravated pimping, French law provides for maximum punishment of 10 years in prison and a fine of 1.5 million euros. For the lesser charges, which can be characterized generically as corruption charges, the fines go to upwards of 400,000 euros and potential prison terms of three to five years.”

According to the BBC, Strauss-Kahn's lawyers say DSK doesn’t deny attending the “libertine” parties but he maintains he did not know the women were prostitutes.

The allegations first emerged in 2011, and Henri Leclerc, one of DSK’s lawyers reportedly told French radio Europe 1 that, “[DSK] could easily not have known, because as you can imagine, at these kinds of parties you're not always dressed, and I challenge you to distinguish a naked prostitute from any other naked woman.”

Henri Leclerc, one of Strauss-Kahn’s lawyers, told the Financial Times that the charges are “dangerous and malicious insinuations and extrapolations” and are “based on an ideological and moral analysis, but certainly not on any legal grounds.""

Mesnooh, the lawyer for Field Fisher Waterhouse law firm, told the AP that “anonymous tips were delivered to the French police in very early 2011, January-February, and so this has actually been an investigation that pre-dates [Strauss-Kahn's additional legal troubles in] New York.""

In New York in 2011, the world witnessed the former French presidential hopeful's fall from grace after he was plucked from an Air France first-class cabin as he was about to depart from John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York and arrested for allegedly assaulting Nafissatou Diallo, a maid at New York’s Times Square Sofitel hotel. The initial charges were dropped after prosecutors said Diallo gave unreliable accounts of what took place during the alleged incident. Since then, two other cases against Strauss-Kahn have been dropped concerning allegations of sexual assault and gang rape."

1D6fVzO,2015-02-23 00:00:00,Five Stories You'll Care About in Politics This Week - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/stories-care-politics-week/story?id=29115645,"So, Jeb Bush is his own man, though he loves talking to his dad’s and his brother’s men. Joe Biden loves all men -- and women, of course, too -- particularly those in early-voting states. Whether Elizabeth Warren and Hillary Clinton learn to love each other might be the biggest question of 2016. Rudy Giuliani thinks he knows what the president loves. And Chris Christie is learning more than he wanted about whom Republican donors love.

Here’s a glimpse at some of the stories the ABC News political team will be tracking in the week ahead:

The annual conservative carnival known as CPAC will come together outside Washington and draw the brightest prospects of the Republican Party, along with servings of Donald Trump and Sarah Palin. The Conservative Political Action Conference has historically been an outlet for presidential contenders to show off their stump speeches and burnish their conservative credentials, and all the major 2016ers will be there. CPAC will be the first multi-candidate showcase to feature former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, whose declaration of independence from the Presidents Bush doesn’t change the fact that his brother’s administration isn’t so fondly remembered by some in the conservative movement. Will Bush dare to mention immigration or education, and risk early boos in his quest for 2016?

Wait -- it’s the end of February already? Those comfy two months Republicans carved for themselves to deal with Homeland Security funding have gone by fast, with no real progress in crafting a bill that can actually pass Congress. Republicans calculated that this deadline was the best way to roll back President Obama’s executive order on immigration. But Democrats are standing their ground, and polls suggest Republicans are more likely to shoulder the blame for a partial departmental shutdown. While the consequences wouldn’t necessarily be dire, since so many DHS employees are considered essential, Homeland Security is kind of a bad department to not fund. A federal judge put a stop to the immigration order this past week, potentially giving Republicans an off-ramp from a confrontation they’re not entirely comfortable with. But word that the White House is plotting to get that ruling reversed scrambles even that calculation. Somebody will have to blink, or somebody will have to cut a deal, and fast.

Rudy Giuliani isn’t running for anything, and hasn’t won an election since 1997. But he still knows how to win/lose a news cycle. “I do not believe that the president loves America,” the former New York City mayor declared, prompting days’ worth of sparring with Democrats, and partial walk-backs that may have made things worse for Giuliani. The dust-up evokes memories of the early, birther-infused days of the Obama presidency, and invites uncomfortable questions for 2016ers. The current context is important, too: President Obama is pointedly refusing to call terrorists “Islamic” or “Muslim,” in a semantic decision his critics fear has policy implications. And Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is readying a Washington trip that will expose deep divisions between the U.S. and one of its closest allies on the issue of Iran.

Joe Biden is flirting ... with something. Or else his schedulers are really good at making us think he is -- how else to read a third early-voting-state visit by the vice president in as many weeks? Next on Biden’s tour is a trip Wednesday to New Hampshire to tout the economy, following up on trips to South Carolina and Iowa. It was in Iowa that Biden said Democrats running for president should be “sticking with what works” -- in essence, he said, running for a “third term” of the Obama administration. Biden himself has said he won’t make up his mind on running until summer, but Democrats continue to be restless about the Hillary-or-bust shape their nominating process seems to be taking. While Hillary Clinton herself still stays away from early states, former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley will hit South Carolina on Friday.

Mayor Rahm Emanuel has gone a long way toward righting his own political ship in advance of Tuesday’s mayoral election in Chicago. But his best bet at guaranteeing himself a second term would come by securing an outright majority in this first round of voting, thereby avoiding an April runoff. Polls suggest 50 percent is within reach but by no means guaranteed for Emanuel, despite a tumultuous first term marked by a spike in violence and tensions over schools and pensions. The general thinking is that one of Emanuel’s lesser-known rivals could consolidate frustration with the mayor, given a one-on-one shot in a runoff. President Obama recorded a radio ad for his former chief of staff, and dropped by the mayor’s campaign headquarters this past week with the knowledge that Emanuel doesn’t want to face six more weeks of campaigning."

In an interview with ABC News, he also explained that one suspect still ""at large"" got out of his car to threaten his wife and daughter.

""The reason I didn’t know this story is, for one, it wasn’t explained to me,"" Robert Meyers said. ""It was explained to me one way. And that’s how I told it. Until we started getting all the information and all the facts came out, that’s how I have knowledge of all this. My son was very hurt, thinking I was going to blame him for his mom going down, and he didn’t come forward with all the things.""

Meyers, who said his family is devastated by the loss of his wife, said he has struggled to piece together the events of that night.

He said his daughter described the events of that night to him. ""The suspect got in front of my wife's car, got out of the driver's seat -- the gentleman they haven't found yet. He's still at large,"" Meyers said.

According to Meyers, the man who is still at large got out of his vehicle and came to the hood of his wife's car and said something to the effect of ""'I'm going to kill you and your daughter,' or 'We’re going to get you and your daughter,'"" Meyers said, recounting what he said his daughter told him.

""And my daughter believes how he knew she was the daughter is because she was screaming 'mommy, mommy,' you know, because he cut them off and let them go,"" Meyers said. ""And after that, my daughter said my wife spun out to get away from this guy right on this street. My daughter said my wife was going as fast as she could. ... My wife was as great driver. She came from a good stock of drivers.""

Police said Erich Nowsch Jr., who was arrested Thursday, told his friends that he was a passenger in the car and police believe he shot Tammy Meyers.

Nowsch's lawyer said in an exclusive interview that his client was acting in self-defense and that no road rage occurred.

Nowsch has been charged with murder, attempted murder and illegal discharge of a gun in the death of Tammy Meyers.

Nowsch made his first court appearance today in Las Vegas. He did not speak and did not enter a plea.

When Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson was asked after the hearing if he will seek the death penalty for Nowsch, he said, ""Nothing is off the table,"" ABC Las Vegas affiliate KTNV reported.

Defense attorney Conrad Claus earlier had told ABC News in an exclusive interview that Nowsch -- not Meyers -- may have been the target the night of the shooting, on Feb. 12.

""The facts seem to point to self-defense in this situation,"" Claus told ABC News. ""It seems to explain the facts we have in front of us more sensibly than any other explanation."""

Dr. Ghofran Ageely, a radiology resident at the King Abdulaziz University Hospital in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, told ABC News he was surprised the cartoon character looked so clear in the x-ray. The item the child swallowed, which appears to be some kind of tiny pendant, looked like a ""pin"" when he first saw it.

""I thought it is just a pin,"" Ageely said in an email. ""But when I opened the frontal view I was shocked to see SpongeBob looking at me with a big smile. Its angle and rotation are just perfect.""

Ageely said the tiny SpongeBob was safely removed from the 16-month-old child through a scope."

The whippet named Burt went missing in August from his home in Manhattan and as it happens, Fire Department of New York Lt. Dave Kelly first spotted the dog a few weeks ago and had been leaving food out for him, but decided that with the storm coming it was time to trap him so he wouldn't be out in the weather.

Kelly had reportedly seen the dog rummaging for food at night time on the FDNY Bureau of Training grounds for about three weeks, ABC station WABC-TV reported. He began to feed Burt with hopes of getting close enough to grab the dog.

Determined to nab the pooch, late Monday into early Tuesday, Kelly set food inside a dog cage on Randall's Island and managed to capture Burt. He searched online, found a Facebook page entitled Bring Burt Home, and contacted Burt's delighted owner.

WABC-TV reported that following the reunion, owner Lauren Piccolo released the following statement:

""I am tremendously grateful for the efforts of the FDNY to recover Burt. Burt had been running loose in the city for more than five months and managed to evade capture by friends, family and many Good Samaritans. While Burt is a resilient dog, I don't think he would have survived such a fierce storm. The FDNY's efforts were incredible and timely! Burt is resting at home and is expected to make a full recovery.""

The latest post on the Facebook page page reads: ""After five months, and of course in the middle of a mega snow storm, I get a call from a really nice fireman who has seen a whippet, nightly for 2 - 3 weeks, near the FDNY training facility on Randall's Island. The fireman has been feeding this dog, but only from a distance because if he gets to close the dog runs - really fast. Sound like my guy? Yup. I can't believe you are still out there, Burt!!!!!!!!!! #BringBurtHome."""

The next winter storm of concern brought heavy snow to parts of the Rockies, with up to 2 feet of snow reported in the higher elevations west of Denver this morning. Elsewhere, over a foot of snow was reported in parts of Wyoming, with strong wind gusts over 50 mph recorded in parts of Utah.

The precipitation with this system will continue to move southeast tonight, bringing snow to the Texas Panhandle, and a wintry mix of freezing rain and sleet developing across northern Texas.

Accumulating sleet is a concern for the Dallas metro area Monday morning as colder air continues to filter into the region, setting the stage for an icy morning commutes with possible travel delays.

The highest additional snow amounts through Monday night will stay focused in the central Rockies, particularly western Colorado, but a light accumulation of snow is expected farther east across parts of the southern Plains.

Sleet is a concern with this system as well, and will be focused on the southern edge of the accumulating snow, mostly in the southern Plains to mid-South.

South of where the snow and sleet occurs will be a swath of freezing rain bringing a dangerous period of accumulating ice on roads, trees, and power lines. Interstate 20 from Texas to central Mississippi will be affected by periods of freezing rain though Monday night.

This winter storm is on the leading edge of yet another blast of arctic air that will be sweeping across much of the country for the first part of the week. On Monday morning, wind chills will dip below zero form the Texas Panhandle to Maine.

Wind chills will be below ZERO from Texas Panhandle to Maine Monday AM. @Ginger_Zee @RobMarciano @Wx_Max @SamWnek pic.twitter.com/lViy0opaab

1D82T26,2015-02-24 00:00:00,Trayvon Martin: DOJ Announces No Charges Against George Zimmerman - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/US/trayvon-martin-doj-announces-charges-george-zimmerman/story?id=29186648,"While the public waits for a Justice Department announcement over two separate investigations spurred by the summer shooting of an unarmed teenager in Ferguson, Missouri, the department announced today it is closing its investigation into the killing of Trayvon Martin.

Justice Department officials met with Martin's family today, and were told that they will not be filing charges against George Zimmerman, who shot the 17-year-old after a confrontation in 2012. Thursday marks three years to the day since Martin was killed.

Federal prosecutors concluded there is not sufficient evidence to prove Zimmerman, a neighborhood watchman in Sanford, Fla., intentionally violated Martin's civil rights.

""Although the department has determined that this matter cannot be prosecuted federally, it is important to remember that this incident resulted in the tragic loss of a teenager's life,"" Acting Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta of the Civil Rights Division said. ""Our decision not to pursue federal charges does not condone the shooting that resulted in the death of Trayvon Martin and is based solely on the high legal standard applicable to these cases.""
The case sparked intense discussions over race in America because Martin was walking to his home with only Skittles and an iced tea in his hands.

Florida prosecutors tried to convict Zimmerman of state-level murder and manslaughter charges, but in July 2013 a jury acquitted him, saying prosecutors didn't have enough evidence to prove their case.

One juror -– the only minority on the all-female jury –- later told ABC News that ""as the law was read to me, if you have no proof that he killed him intentionally, you can't say he's guilty.""

""You can't put the man in jail even though in our hearts we felt he was guilty,"" she said. ""But we had to grab our hearts and put it aside and look at the evidence.""

In Sanford, race-related tensions had been simmering for nearly a century, but Martin's death ""was the proverbial 'straw that broke the camel's back,'"" bringing ""those issues to the surface,"" the new Sanford police chief, Cecil Smith, recently told federal officials.

After Martin was killed, Holder sat down his own teenage son to explain that -- as unfair as it may be -- young black men must often interact with police in a different way than others, he told a convention in April 2014. It was ""a conversation I hoped I'd never have to have,"" Holder added.

As media attention mounted over Martin's death, protests grew across the country calling for justice. The city of Sanford now says a police department had not been scrutinized like that by the press, religious organizations, social activists and the broader public since Los Angeles police beat Rodney King in 1991.

Zimmerman was not a police officer and the neighborhood watch program he was a part of was independent from local police.

Many accused Zimmerman of discriminating against Martin –- essentially taking action against the teenager and ultimately killing him because Martin was black. Zimmerman is Hispanic.

The Justice Department's Civil Rights Division and FBI opened an investigation into the case, noting ""experienced federal prosecutors"" would determine ""whether the evidence reveals a prosecutable violation"" of federal law. In a statement, the department noted there are ""limited federal criminal civil rights statutes within our jurisdiction.""

Privately and publicly, Justice Department officials have been telegraphing all along that they were unlikely to file charges against Zimmerman. And in November 2013, Holder said the case against Zimmerman ""in substantial part was resolved"" with his acquittal months earlier.

Nevertheless, federal officials have insisted their civil-rights probe would be thorough and complete. Several months ago –- nearly two years into the Justice Department's investigation –- Holder said federal investigators were still seeking to interview certain witnesses ""as a result of some recent developments.""

More recently, Holder has said he hoped to announce the findings of the Zimmerman and Ferguson-related probes before he leaves office, which could happen in a matter of weeks, depending on when the U.S. Senate confirms his successor.

Holder has said then when a decision is announced in the Zimmerman case, it will be accompanied by ""as much information"" as possible detailing the Justice Department's findings.

In the Ferguson case, the department is currently conducting two probes into the matter.

A criminal investigation will try to determine whether then-officer Darren Wilson used unreasonable force and intentionally violated Michael Brown's civil rights when he shot the unarmed teenager in August. The second probe - though not criminal in nature –- will look more broadly into whether the Ferguson police department has routinely engaged in a ""pattern or practice"" of unlawful and discriminatory policing.

A state grand jury in Ferguson, Missouri, declined to indict Wilson in Novembe4 2014. Many expect the Justice Department will not be able to bring federal charges against Wilson, but will take action against the local police department.

Detroit born and bred. An Army veteran. And now he is a self-described ""Soldier of Christ"" back in Iraq, fighting ISIS on the front lines.

""People ask me, 'Why you?' I come back and I say, 'Why not? Why just me? Where's everyone else at?"" said Brett, who requested that ABC News not use his last name to protect his family back home.

""Jesus says, you know, 'What you do unto the least of them, you do unto me,'"" he added. ""I take that very seriously.""

Brett returned to Iraq six months ago. In 2006-07, he served in the infamous ""Triangle of Death,"" where he said he was badly wounded in an IED attack on his Humvee.

He came here, he told ABC News, to defend the defenseless -- to protect the Christians and others in this part of Iraq who have been terrorized by the ISIS onslaught: driven from their homes, massacred, their women and girls raped and sold into slavery.

He is of Irish and Polish descent, raised Roman Catholic and now describes himself simply as a Christian.

Brett fights alongside a small, local Christian militia -- the Dweikh Nawsha. They are under the command of Kurdish peshmerga forces in this part of Iraq.

From Brett's forward position, in the deserted Christian village of Bakufa, about eight miles from the outskirts of the city of Mosul in northern Iraq, you can see the black flags of ISIS whipping against the sky in a stiff winter wind.

But a statue hundreds of years old, recently analyzed in Europe, is a rarity: A full mummy of a meditating monk resides inside of it.

Researchers at the Netherlands' Meander Medical Center found the preserved body of a Buddhist master who likely died around the year 1100, believed to be named Liuquan, in a statue that had been exhibited last year at the Drents Museum in Netherlands.

Scientists had known the statue contained a mummy, but even so, the CT scans of the statue reveal unprecedented information about an extreme form of meditation.

Its display at the Drents Museum marked the first time the statue had been outside of China, reported Discover Magazine, and following the close of the exhibit the statue was taken to the Meander Medical Center in Amersfoort, Netherlands for CT scans.

The practice might sound like a grim effort to take one's life, but that wasn't its intent: Self-mummification was only for the most devoted of religious monks, and the practice was seen as a path to enlightenment or an advanced spiritual state.

The imaging confirmed the existence of Liquan's mummy. The monk, believed to be a member of the Chinese Meditation School, may have practiced self-mummification, considered by certain Buddhists to be the highest form of religious enlightenment.


The process involved first a rigorous, year-long diet of water nuts, berries and other similar foods, abstaining completely from grains and more substantial food, reports  c|net. Afterward, the monk would likely be fed a tea made from a toxic lacquer tree, given a tube used for food and air, and a bell to indicate that the monk was still alive.


When the bell stopped ringing, the monk would be sealed in a tomb for three more years, and when reopened, a deceased monk found intact would be said to have reached true enlightenment; those who decomposed would have been considered to fall short of their goal, though their attempts were still honored. Some successful ""living Buddhas"" would have shrines built in their honor, according to a study of the practice by iO9.

This particular monk's organs have been removed and replaced with scrolls of paper inscribed with ancient Chinese characters; the Drents Museum considers it an example of self-mummification, and more research is needed into the existence of the scrolls and their meaning.

The statue will be on display at the Hungarian Natural History Museum until May 2015."

Temperatures dipped into the single digits and teens across the Northeast and Midwest overnight, with snow and slush still coating roadways.

The storm brought more than a foot and a half of snow in some areas, including 19 inches of snow in Chicago, and 18 inches expected in northeastern Maine.

One of the storm’s victims, Cynthia Levine, 57, was struck and killed by a snow plow in Weymouth, south of Boston.

In Delaware County, Pennsylvania, strong winds knocked a tree onto the road, killing a driver.

After the snow stopped falling in Chicago, many commuters were embroiled in traffic crashes. At least 45 vehicles were involved in a pileup on Interstate 294 in the Chicago suburb of Hickory Hills. Eight people were taken to area hospitals, but none of the injuries were believed to be life-threatening.

Train travelers also faced troublesome commutes. On Long Island in New York, the tracks were deliberately set on fire to stop them from freezing over. Outside Chicago, 70 passengers were stranded after an Amtrak train stalled, finally reaching the destination nearly six hours later.

In Boston, some train commuters were stuck for nearly two hours because of an outage.

The snow also postponed the victory parade for the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots, with the celebration now scheduled for Wednesday.

There's a scientific explanation for why #TheDress looks black and blue to some people and white and gold to the others.

(But seriously, it looks white and gold, amIRight?)

Although your eyes perceive colors differently based on color perceptors in them called cones, experts say your brain is doing the legwork to determine what you're seeing -- and it gets most of the blame for your heated debates about #TheDress.

""Our brain basically biases certain colors depending on what time of day it is, what the surrounding light conditions are,"" said optometrist Thomas Stokkermans, who directs the optometry division at UH Case Medical Center in Cleveland, Ohio. ""So this is a filtering process by the brain.""

Objects appear reddish at dawn and dusk, but they appear blueish in the middle of the day, Stokkermans said.

So we can recognize the same objects in different light conditions, our brains tweak the way we see things, he added.

""The brain is very good at adjusting and calibrating so you perceive light conditions as constant even though they vary widely,"" he said.

Colors can appear different depending on what they're near and the memory and past experiences of the beholder, Dr. Lisa Lystad, a neuro-opthalmologist at Cleveland Clinic’s Cole Eye Institute.

For instance, people who live in snow all year round above the Arctic Circle have several names for different colors of snow, but to most of us, snow is just snow. She said she has a turquoise purse that some of her friends swear is green and others are sure is blue.

Cataracts, colorblindness and eye disease can also alter colors for the beholder. Monet's famous water lily pond painting is thought to have been painted when he was developing cataracts, Lystad said.

But your perception of the dress doesn't mean you have an eye problem, she said.

""Vision just barely starts in the eye,"" Lystad said. ""Your brain is what gives names to the colors.""

David Calkins, a professor at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine and director of research at the Vanderbilt Eye Institute, said setting international color standards for everything from wires to fruits to paint pigments was a huge challenge before the digital age.

""There's no way for me to verify the color that your brain perceives versus the color that my brain perceives,"" he said. ""What I call magenta, you might call violet. What I call burgundy, you might call purple.""

And now that the digital age is here, there are subtle differences between how something can appear to you on a television screen versus a computer monitor versus a cell phone, Calkins said."

""Anthem was the target of a very sophisticated external cyber attack,"" the company said in a letter to its members. ""These attackers gained unauthorized access to Anthem’s IT system and have obtained personal information from our current and former members such as their names, birthdays, medical IDs/social security numbers, street addresses, email addresses and employment information, including income data.""

The FBI said tonight that it's aware of the Anthem intrusion and is investigating the matter. ""Individuals contacted by the company should take steps to monitor and safeguard their personally identifiable information and report any suspected instances of identity theft to the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center at www.ic3.gov,"" the agency said in a statement.

The FBI praised Anthem for notifying them right away of the hack. ""Speed matters when notifying law enforcement of an intrusion, as cyber criminals can quickly destroy critical evidence needed to identify those responsible. Rapid notification allows the FBI to quickly deploy our cyber experts to preserve evidence and work with a company’s incident responders to help them remediate their networks and rid their systems of harmful malware.""

Anthem said once it dicovered the attack, it ""immediately made every effort to close the security vulnerability, contacted the FBI and began fully cooperating with their investigation,"" the company said. ""Anthem has also retained Mandiant, one of the world’s leading cybersecurity firms, to evaluate our systems and identify solutions based on the evolving landscape.""

Joseph R. Swedish, CEO of Anthem, said associates’ personal information, including his own, was accessed during this security breach.

""We join you in your concern and frustration, and I assure you that we are working around the clock to do everything we can to further secure your data,"" he wrote.

Anthem said it will individually notify current and former members whose information has been accessed as well as provide credit monitoring and identity protection services free of charge to those affected.

1DaGa6V,2015-01-28 00:00:00,"5-Year-Old Girl Dies After Catching the Flu, Even After Getting Vaccine - ABC News",http://abcnews.go.com/Health/year-girl-dies-catching-flu-vaccine/story?id=28526729,"A Las Vegas kindergartner who died days after coming down with the flu felt well enough to play outside 24 hours before she collapsed, her father told ABC News.

Kiera Driscoll, 5, had a slight fever on Sunday morning, but she seemed to be feeling better after taking some children's ibuprofen, said her father, Patrick Driscoll.

""In fact, she was playing outside that afternoon with my wife and even made a comment that it was 'the most fun time ever,'"" Driscoll said.

But then Kiera's slight fever returned and her cough worsened and included phlegm, Driscoll said. At about 4 a.m., her parents gave her medicine to help expand her airways by way of an albuterol nebulizer. She didn't have asthma but occasionally had a barking cough as a baby, Driscoll said. Afterward, he stayed up with her watching cartoons until she fell asleep again at 8 a.m.

That morning, the Driscolls took her to an urgent care center, where she got another albuterol treatment and was given a steroid to help her breathe, Driscoll said. He went to work, and his wife stayed home to take care of Kiera.

Kiera's mother tucked her into bed a few hours later for a nap, and turned away to turn on a vaporizer when Kiera said, ""I can't breathe. It's hard to breathe,"" Driscoll said. Then, the little girl collapsed and passed out.

Kiera's mother is trained in CPR and jumped into action, clearing Kiera's airways, performing rescue breathing and calling 911, Driscoll said. Kiera's pulse went away and came back in the emergency room. But her brain wave activity diminished, Driscoll said, and she developed an irregular heart beat and went into cardiac arrest. She died the following day, on Tuesday, Jan. 20.

""Their working diagnosis was that a mucus plug of thick mucus got coughed up and clogged, lodged in her trachea, preventing her from being able to breathe,"" Driscoll said.

The little girl's elementary school celebrated her life last week by dressing in purple, releasing purple balloons and eating frozen yogurt, according to KNTV, ABC's affiliate in Las Vegas. ""Frozen"" was Kiera's favorite movie, and a stuffed Olaf doll sat in her seat at school after her death, according to the station.

Laurel Beckstead, the headmaster of the American Heritage Academy, where Kiera went to school, told KNTV the death was shocking. Beckstead is also Kiera's aunt.

""She went home happy, healthy, and then to get a phone call that Monday that she had gone to Quick Care Monday morning, released and went home and then later collapsed, was almost a shocking disbelief,"" Beckstead told the station. ""How can this be happening to Kiera?""

As of the week ending Jan. 17, 56 pediatric flu-related deaths had been reported to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Kiera's official cause of death was that she went into cardiac arrest after coming down with influenza A and pneumonia, according to the Clark County coroner's office in Nevada, which did not examine her body after her death.

Dr. Frank Esper, a pediatric infectious disease physician at UH Rainbow Babies and Children’s Hospital in Cleveland, said death's like Kiera's can be confusing, and some states require autopsies when the explanation is unclear. He said it's important to remember that influenza can cause death, especially in people with underlying lung and heart conditions -- which may not be diagnosed. People at risk for complications, including young children, pregnant women, people with asthma, and the elderly, should contact their physician at the first sign of flu, he said. They may be prescribed antiviral medications to shorten their illness and prevent it from worsening.

""Though Kiera's passing has shattered the world her birth created for me, the joy of raising her was worth it,"" Driscoll said of his daughter at her funeral. He shared the eulogy on  a fundraising page set up for Kiera to express his gratitude for the love and support his family received

Driscoll told ABC News that Kiera got a flu shot, and they still want other parents to vaccinate their children.

""Vaccines help save lives, and they help keep other people from getting infected as well,"" he said. ""We always want people to be vaccinated.""

He said his family has taken comfort in the fact that his wife knew CPR and did everything she could. And he knows he'll see his little girl again someday, he said.

""If there's something we can say to someone going through something similar,"" he said. ""Hold on to your faith. Rely on family and community, and never take a moment for granted."""

Epstein, 69, was arrested in October 2013 for allegedly charging undercover FBI agents $60,000 to kidnap a man and coerce him into granting his wife a Judaic divorce decree.

Epstein and his son David, along with two other rabbis named in the federal complaint as Jay Goldstein and Binyamin Stimler, face federal charges of conspiracy to kidnap and kidnapping. If found guilty, the men face a maximum penalty of 20 years to life in prison.

During Wednesday’s opening statement, prosecutors played a video of allegedly Epstein discussing a staged kidnapping with two undercover FBI agents, wherein he can be heard openly discussing the use of stun guns on men's genitalia.

""If it can get a bull that weighs five tons to move,"" the man on the video identified by the FBI as Epstein is heard telling the undercover agents, ""you put it in certain parts of his body and in one minute the guy will know.""

""Mendel Epstein talked about forcing compliance through the use of 'tough guys' who utilize electric cattle prods, karate, handcuffs and place plastic bags on the heads of husbands,"" said FBI Special Agent Bruce Kamerman shortly after Epstein's arrest.

Epstein's defense claims he was a ""champion of women's rights"" and employed ""torture as term of art"" in order to get a husband's ""evil"" recalcitrance to ""leave his body."" According to the strictest interpretation of ancient Jewish law, a religious divorce, referred to as a ""get"", can only be granted by a husband regardless of the circumstances that may have caused a marriage to break up. Without a ""get"", a religious Jewish woman cannot remarry or get on with her life and she becomes an ostracized member of the community called an “agunah” or a chained person. Convincing reluctant husbands to grant their wives divorces is a specialty among ultra-Orthodox rabbis.

The defense is expected to tell the jury about the oldest interpretation of Jewish law that broadly outlines torture as a legitimate vehicle for convincing recalcitrant husbands to grant their wives religious divorces. Defense lawyer Robert Stahl said during his opening statements that ""the process is a legitimate divorce. It's not a criminal conspiracy."" He told the jury that ancient Jewish texts endorse the use of coercion and physical torture in an effort to convince men to grant their wives divorces.

U.S District Judge Freda Wolfson reminded Epstein's lawyers on day one of the trial that this type of defense is dangerous because the lawyers are essentially asking the jury to overrule federal criminal law.

The trial, which is expected to last five weeks, stems from a lengthy investigation that started more than two years ago in an ultra-Orthodox enclave in Lakewood, N.J. After three alleged victims came forward, undercover FBI agents posing as a disgruntled wife and her brother, lured Epstein into allegedly describing his methods in incredible detail on audio and video recordings. Also on the video prosecutors say the rabbis are shown stretching as if they're warming up for a fight.

Epstein, who is an internationally known expert in Jewish divorce and author of an authoritative book on the matter, boasts that he has participated in 2,500 divorces."
1DAtp6Z,2015-02-27 00:00:00,"Rand Paul Wows CPAC Crowd, Talks Privacy, Tax Cuts, Hillary Clinton - ABC News",http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/rand-paul-wows-cpac-crowd-talks-privacy-tax/story?id=29277531,"Sen. Rand Paul got a rousing reception this afternoon at the Conservative Political Action Conference, lighting up a crowd that tends to have a libertarian streak to it, saying, “In the coming weeks, I will propose the largest tax cut in American history.”

Speaking with rolled-up sleeves, he promised to pitch “a tax cut that will leave more money in the paychecks of every worker in America. My tax plan will keep the IRS out of your life and out the way of every job creator in America. My plan will also cut spending and balance the budget in just five years.”

Paul, R-Ky., blasted Congress, now controlled by Republicans, calling it “dysfunctional.”

“Often, bills are plopped on our desk with only a few hours to review,” he said. “No one, and I mean no one, is able to read what is in the bill. I propose something truly outrageous: Congress should read every bill.”

The crowd was packed with supporters, and Paul was interrupted by chants of “President Paul, President Paul.” He perhaps received the loudest applause when talking about personal privacy and going after the woman he may face if he they both choose to run in 2016: Hillary Clinton.

“Hillary’s war in Libya is a perfect example,” he told the CPAC crowd in National Harbor, Maryland. “Hillary’s war made us less safe,"" adding, ""Libya's less stable.""

He said to cheers: “It’s time for Hillary Clinton to permanently retire.”

Calling the crowd “lovers of liberty,” he asked them to “rise to the occasion.”

“You do have a right to privacy,"" he said. ""Your rights are who you are, your rights are what you are, your rights are in your DNA -- and the government can, quite frankly, get over it.

""I say that the phone records of law-abiding citizens are none of their damn business,"" he added. ""From within, our freedom is threatened by debt and by a government that regulates everything that moves.”

He differed in some ways with other Republican presidential contenders who have taken the stage at the conference since Thursday, specifically on the issue of foreign policy -- an issue that may make him an outlier in the GOP field, but was well-received by the libertarian-leaning activists gathered.

“At home, conservatives understand that the government is the problem, not the solution. But as conservatives, we should not succumb to the notion that government inept at home will somehow become successful abroad,” he said, ""that a government that can’t even deliver the mail will somehow be able to create nations abroad. Without question, we must be strong. Without question, we must defend ourselves. I envision an America with a national defense unparalleled, undefeatable and unencumbered by nation building.”

He ended the speech by asking the crowd to “stand” with him: “Will you fight for freedom? Will you vote for freedom?”

Paul is popular with the CPAC crowd. He has won the CPAC straw poll the last two years, and his father, former Rep. Ron Paul, a three-time Republican presidential candidate, won the straw poll in 2010 and 2011. This year's winner will be revealed Saturday.

However, Paul received some criticism today at CPAC, even if it was veiled."

The jurors -- speaking exclusively Wednesday to ABC News -- said they spent time going over the facts in the case before reaching the verdict, which comes with a sentence of life in prison. Juror Barrett Hutchinson said the jurors ruled out the possibility that Routh was insane at the time of the shooting, a possibility discussed by mental health experts during the trial.

Routh pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity and his attorneys argued that the former Marine had mental disorders and was in the grips of psychosis at the time of the gun range shootings.

Under Texas law, even if a person was suffering from a mental illness, they can be found guilty as long as they understood that what they did was wrong.

Kristina Yager said she and her fellow jurors wondered whether Routh was faking the depths of his psychosis at the time of the shooting.

“I know a lot of us came in this jury questioning that, but evidence showed there was a real definite pattern there, when it came to his earlier convictions,” Yeager said, discussing Routh’s pattern of drug or alcohol abuse, followed by police trouble and claims of post-traumatic stress disorder.

While many of the jurors avoided reading Kyle’s book or watching the blockbuster movie that it inspired, Hutchinson admitted that he watched the film, and said that it helped him understand Kyle’s role as a Navy SEAL.

“You just put that to the side, and take in the facts and make your own judgment. I put [movie details] out of my mind, and looked at Chris as a person, looked at Chad as a person, looked at Eddie as a person,” said Hutchinson, who did not specify when he saw the film.

The jury consisted of 10 women and two men, and was tasked with choosing from three possible decisions: guilty, not guilty, or not guilty by reason of insanity. State prosecutors did not seek the death penalty in the case.

The trial lasted for nine days, and jurors deliberated for more than two hours before reaching the verdict."

He was 83.

""He was a remarkable man, well known not only for his acting and directing, but also for his photography, contemporary art collection, and for his extremely generous philanthropic contributions and support of the arts,"" Gersh said via a statement to ABC. ""A private memorial service is being planned by the family. He will be missed by all.""

Nimoy, who played first officer to William Shatner's Captain Kirk on the Starship Enterprise in TV and movies, died Friday morning in Bel-Air, California, his granddaughter Madeleine Nimoy confirmed.

His son Adam told the Associated Press that he died of end-stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

The actor revealed he was struggling with the ailment in 2014, according to the New York Times. Nimoy had been a smoker, which contributed to the ailment, before he gave up the habit years ago.

“I quit smoking 30 yrs ago. Not soon enough. I have COPD ... Smokers, please understand. If you quit after you’re diagnosed with lung damage it’s too late. Grandpa says learn my lesson. Quit now. LLAP,” Nimoy tweeted in separate posts last year.

Earlier this week, Nimoy tweeted for the last time, writing, ""A life is like a garden. Perfect moments can be had, but not preserved, except in memory. LLAP,"" signing the tweet with his iconic phrase ""Live Long and Prosper.""

A life is like a garden. Perfect moments can be had, but not preserved, except in memory. LLAP

""I loved him like a brother. We will all miss his humor, his talent, and his capacity to love,"" his ""Star Trek"" co-star William Shatner said in a tweet.

Flowers will be placed on his star in on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 10:30 a.m. PT, officials said.

Nimoy -- a United States Army veteran, who was born in Boston, Massachusetts -- first began acting at the age of 8 locally, then in the early 1950's, staring in TV runs, such as ""The Silent Service,"" ""Broken Arrow"" and ""Dragnet."" But it was his debut as Mr. Spock in the 1960's ""Star Trek"" that made him a cult legend.

He first brought Mr. Spock to the screen in 1966 for the original ""Star Trek"" pilot, a character he played on TV until 1969. He would go on to star in eight movies and build a cult following as the half human, half Vulcan famous for his hand gesture that meant ""Live Long and Prosper.""

After a long and successful career since the beginning of ""Trek,"" Nimoy had brought back his famous role in 2009's reboot ""Star Trek,"" and the recent sequel ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" in 2013. Zachary Quinto played a younger version of Spock.

In an interview with StarTrek.com, Nimoy expressed his gratitude to reboot director J.J. Abrams for bringing him back to honor him in the new series.

""I think he’s done a great thing for Star Trek. I’m very grateful to him. We all owe him a lot. When someone comes along like he has done and picks it up and elevates it, we should be grateful. So when J.J. calls me, I take the call,"" he said.

But Nimoy was more than just an actor -- starring as of late as a voice in 2011's ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" and as Dr. William Bell in another cult classic series ""Fringe."" Nimoy began his career as an acting teacher in his early 20's in Hollywood, and more recently the author of his autobiographies, ""I Am Not Spock"" in 1975 and ""I Am Spock"" in 1995.

In addition to his over 130 acting credits, Nimoy had a dozen directing credits, including the 1987 hit ""3 Men and a Baby,"" starring Tom Selleck and Ted Danson and a couple ""Star Trek"" movies. Nimoy also starred as himself in hits like ""Futurama,"" ""Ancient Mysteries"" and ""In Search of..."" as a host in the late 1970's and early 1980's.

Somewhere in the middle of all his success, Nimoy went back to school and earned a master’s degree in Spanish from Antioch University Austin in his 40's, then later an honorary doctorate, according to the Times.

Nimoy was married twice - once to actoress Sandra Zober from 1954 to 1987 and most recently to Susan Bay from 1989 till his death. He is father to Julie and Adam Nimoy. His son, 58, followed in his famous father's footsteps, directing episodes on ""NYPD Blue,"" ""Gilmore Girls"" and ""The Practice.""

Nimoy is survived by his wife Susan Bay and his two children, Adam and Julie."

Investigators returned to the factory today in the Red Hook section, a day after the owner shot and killed himself in an apparent suicide as authorities raided it. police said.

There's a good chance the cherry atop your sundae or at the bottom of your Manhattan is from Dell's Maraschino Cherries, a family business founded in 1948 that now appears to have also hosted what sources described to ABC News as a large-scale, elaborate marijuana growing operation.

A team of city and state environmental regulators, along with prosecutors from the Brooklyn District Attorney's Office, had been at the company for several hours Tuesday investigating a complaint of illegal chemical dumping in the waters off Red Hook, prosecutors said.

At first owner Arthur Mondella, 57, cooperated with the search, police said. Then, as investigators discovered ""flimsy shelving and a faint smell of marijuana,"" a source briefed on the investigation said, Mondella became increasingly vague.

When a team member said, ""Well we're going to get a warrant to get behind this wall"" that's when Mondella ""excused himself to his private bathroom where he apparently shot himself and died at a local hospital,"" a statement from the Brooklyn District Attorney's office said.

Prior to the gunshot, a source said Mondella yelled to his sister, who had been standing outside the bathroom: ""Take care of my kids.""

About 80 pounds of marijuana were recovered in three huge bags. Hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash was also found on the property, authorities said.

Several luxury cars were also recovered, including a Rolls-Royce, a Porsche and Harley-Davidson motorcycle.

Mondella has a couple prior arrests, but they are sealed. A previous 2011 arrest for assaulting his second wife at their former Brighton Beach home had been dropped, authorities said.

Dell's Maraschino Cherries had recently undergone a $5 million makeover of its Red Hook plant which employs a dozen people.

The investigation into environmental crimes continues though it remains unclear whether anyone would now face charges."

But it turns out they're hearing a winter phenomenon that's uncommon to the region.

""It sounded like an explosion underneath. It moved the floor,"" one resident told the 911 call center in Spring Hill, Tennessee.

""They say it sounded like a plane hit the building. But it was three different buildings,"" the caller said, according to ABC affiliate WKRN in Nashville.

People often hear this noise more acutely at night because ambient noise during the day tends to drown it out.

""Whenever we get really cold weather, with temperatures around zero, ice or snow on the ground or previous rain event, you'll usually hear this at night,"" said Bobby Boyd, meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Nashville. ""It's just a sudden cracking in the frozen soil or rock that's saturated with ice.""

During his 49 years of experience, Boyd said he's been hearing more of this activity this winter, which he attributes it to the record-breaking cold. This winter has been the first time there have been sub-zero degrees Fahrenheit temperatures in Nashville since February 1996.

Boyd, 68, said he is surprised that callers have likened the sound to a loud boom or believed it was an airplane crash.

""It's like an explosion but a muffled boom sound. It's not really loud, at least the ones I heard,"" Boyd said.

But it was loud enough to wake Boyd up at 4:30 a.m. two nights ago, and clearly audible at 7 p.m. last night.

Boyd said he hasn't heard of a frost quake causing property damage, as it often happens in a relatively shallow part of the ground, but he doesn't rule it out.

""Any movement in the ground where you have frost and freeze, even without the explosion, can cause cracks in sidewalks or heaving in the soil. Winter time is hard on roads and paved areas,"" he said."
1Dc63YJ,2015-03-30 00:00:00,"Germanwings Crash Co-Pilot Seemed Like a 'Normal Guy,' Fellow Pilot Says - ABC News",http://abcnews.go.com/International/germanwings-crash-pilot-normal-guy-fellow-pilot/story?id=29974407,"A German pilot who recently flew with the co-pilot accused by French prosecutors of deliberately crashing a Germanwings plane said he seemed like a ""normal guy,"" and he ""had plans for the future.""

French prosecutors have said co-pilot Andreas Lubitz deliberately slammed the passenger plane into a mountain on Tuesday. Authorities have since said he hid evidence of an illness from his employers, including a sick note that was found torn up inside his apartment in Dusseldorf dated from the day of the crash.

Frank Woiton, a Germanwings pilot, told German TV station WDR that he saw nothing unusual about Lubitz when he flew with him less than a month ago.

A Lufthansa spokesman told ABC News that the FBI has questioned Lufthansa flight trainers in the U.S. who worked with Lubitz at the Airline Training Center in Arizona. The spokesman would not comment on whether the questioning revolved around trying to reconstruct Lubitz's mental state during his time there.

The father of one of the victims in the Germanwings plane crash in the French Alps said today airlines should take better care of their pilots' welfare.

""I believe the airlines should be more transparent and our finest pilots looked after properly,"" said Philip Bramley, according to The Associated Press. ""We put our lives and our children's lives in their hands.""

His 28-year-old son, Paul Bramley, was one of the 150 people killed. Bramley called Lubitz's motive irrelevant while speaking near the site of the crash.

""What is relevant, is that it should never happen again; my son and everyone on that plane should not be forgotten, ever,"" he said.

German State Prosecutor Christoph Kumpa said Friday that ""a torn-up current sick note ... valid for the day of the incident"" had been found inside Lubitz's apartment in Dusseldorf, adding that it ""would -- according to preliminary evaluation -- support the assumption that the [pilot] had concealed his illness towards his employer and his occupational environment.""

Kumpa said the note found indicated Lubitz, 27, ""was declared by a medical doctor unfit to work.""

The disclosure of torn medical documents at the co-pilot's home came shortly before Germanwings' parent company, Lufthansa, announced that it would be changing company policy to require two ""authorized persons"" remain in the cockpit at all times during the flight, in light of the finding that Lubitz apparently stopped the captain from re-entering the cockpit and forced the plane to crash.

In addition to the findings suggesting Lubitz was hiding an illness, a search of his apartment in Dusseldorf yielded no suicide note and the city's prosecutor announced that there was no evidence that political or religious factors were involved in the crash.

Officials seized medical documents at Lubitz's home that indicated ""an existing illness and appropriate medical treatment,"" Senior State Prosecutor Ralf Herrenbrueck said in the statement, according to the AP.

Torn up prescriptions and notes from doctors ""support the current preliminary assessment that the deceased hid his illness from his employer and colleagues,"" the statement said, according to the AP.

The New York Times reported that Lubitz sought treatment for vision problems that may have put his future as a pilot at risk, two officials with knowledge of the investigation told the newspaper."

That's how Donna Scharton remembers her beloved parents, Floyd and Violet Hartwig, before they died on Feb. 11.

The couple, who had been married for 67 years, died in their home in a very ""Notebook""-like situation.

As the two laid close to one another, Scharton and other immediate family members pushed their beds close together as they all knew the end was near.

""My mom had dementia for the last several years and around the holidays we noticed she was going down,"" Scharton of Fresno, California said. ""Then, I got a call from the doctor saying 'your dad has kidney failure and he has two weeks to live.' So, we decided to put them in hospice together.""

Prior to their declining health, the Hartwigs owned a ranch in Easton, California. The two met while in grammar school and had developed a relationship upon Mr. Hartwig returning home from the Navy.

They married on Aug. 16, 1947 and had two other children, Carol and Kenneth, in addition to Scharton.

""My dad was in the Navy for six years,"" she told ABC News. ""He worked for the J.B. Hill Company delivering eggs and then for a feed company. Mom stayed home, helped take care of the ranch, and cooked all the meals. She made breakfast for dad at 4:30 in the morning every day.""

Scharton said that although his health was deteriorating, her father's main priority was the love of his life.

""He would tell the doctor, 'I'm okay I just want her fixed',” she added. ""That was his concern; not how bad his pain was, but that he wanted my mom fixed.""

""We could tell my dad was in a lot more pain,"" Scharton cried. ""We said 'it's getting close,' so we pushed the hospital beds together as far as we could. We put their hands together, and my dad died holding my mom's hand. Mom was not coherent, but we told her that dad had passed away and that he was waiting for her. She died five hours later.""

Scharton's daughter, Cynthia Letson, remembers her grandparents as simple people who just loved having their family beside them.

""They never, ever asked for anything,"" she said. ""All they ever wanted was their family and it was amazing that they got that in the end.""

In honor of their legacy, Scharton is holding onto warm memories of her mother and father.

""Mom did a lot of sewing – made our clothes and stuff,"" Scharton said. ""She joined the PTA at school and she loved doing her crossword puzzles. They were very devoted and when dad came home we'd always have supper together.

""I remember them kissing each other goodbye every morning. I remember mom called him Blondie because he had such pretty blonde hair and blue eyes.""

""What I want people to get out of this story is my dad's commitment to serving his country and loving his family. ""What we felt was keeping them alive was the will to live, and that they didn’t want to let go of each other."""

Sajida al-Rishawi was hanged early Wednesday morning local time in Jordan along with another prisoner identified as a senior terrorist, according to the Jordanian Information Ministry and state television.

In the days that followed, ISIS released a video of the Japanese journalist after he was apparently killed and, Monday, uploaded online gruesome footage apparently showing the Jordanian pilot, Lt. Muath al-Kasasbeh, being burned alive in an outdoor jail cell.

The video was met with fury across Jordan, and a spokesperson for Jordanian armed forces appeared on state television, saying, ""Our punishment and revenge will be as huge as the loss of the Jordanians,"" according to the Associated Press. The spokesperson said the military believed al-Kasasbeth was actually killed in early January, well before the ""negotiations"" with ISIS over the Japanese hostage took place.

Al-Rishawi has been on death row in Jordan since confessing to her role in a 2005 al Qaeda bombing attack in Jordan.

The man killed with al-Rishawi, Ziad al-Karbouli, was identified by Jordanian state TV as a former associate of ex-al Qaeda in Iraq leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. Al-Karbouli has reportedly been in prison since 2006."

The three school friends from East London’s Bethnal Green, ages 15 to 16, left their homes before 8:00 a.m. local time Tuesday and met at Gatwick airport in London where they boarded a Turkish Airlines flight, according to a police news release.

""We are reaching out to the girls using the Turkish media and social media,” Britain’s Counter-Terrorism Commander Richard Walton said, “in the hope that they hear our messages, hear our concerns for their safety and have the courage to return now, back to their families who are so worried about them.""

Should the girls see news reports about themselves, Walton said he hopes they’ll listen to such a “direct appeal.”

“Clearly if these three girls travel to Syria, they’re in grave danger,” he said. “We are aware as many people of the treatment of girls and women currently in that part of Syria. You know the prospect is not good and we want to prevent them from getting there.”

Statements attributed to one major terror group in the region, ISIS, purportedly described the way its fighters treat women -– from buying and selling young girls as slaves to justifying rape of “non-believers.”

The U.S Senior Adviser for Foreign Fighters, Ambassador Thomas Krajeski, said during a news briefing today that young girls traveling to Syria and Iraq were being considered as problematic as those traveling to fight.

“Fighters include people not only picking up a gun, but also going to support Islamists, in some way, including young women who have been attracted to the fight for various reasons and in some cases children,” he said, adding the prospect of fighters returning to their home countries to conduct attacks is of “great concern.”

Krajeski also acknowledged the difficulty of controlling the Turkish-Syrian border. “This is a very difficult border to police,” he said. “The most effective way to do it is to provide border officials with the best possible information. I believe Turks are committed to increasing checks and controls of incoming travelers and border controls.”

At the Scotland Yard briefing, officials said the case of the three missing girls was related to one concerning another 15-year-old girl who was stopped by police in December while allegedly trying to get to Syria to join ISIS. Officials said the three missing girls were friends with the 15-year-old."

Tom Cotton took a hard line Thursday against the Obama administration’s push to shut the prison down.

“In my opinion, the only problem of Guantanamo Bay is there are too many empty beds and cells there right now,” said Cotton, R-Arkansas. “We should be sending more terrorists there for further interrogation to keep this country safe.”

“Islamic terrorists don't need an excuse to attack the United States. They don't attack us for what we do, they attack us for who we are,” Cotton said.

In an exchange with DOD Principal Deputy Undersecretary for Policy Brian McKeon, Cotton said the Obama administration’s move to shut down the facility and relocate prisoners is based on politics, not security or human rights concerns.

“As far as I’m concerned, every last one of them can rot in hell, but as long as they don’t do that, then they can rot in Guantanamo Bay!” Cotton said, shutting off his mic.

Sen. Joe Manchin, D-West Virginia, then tried to lighten the mood, beginning his line of questioning by saying “… And on that happy note.”

Manchin then told the committee he used to hold similar views with Cotton before he visited the detention center himself.

“I came back changed,” Manchin said. “It's not an atmosphere that our guards should be in or our military people should -- with their talent, should be used and wasted along those lines, is what I saw.”"

Not a gang member, or a bully, or a child molester, but the police.

“We were over here about to cross the street the two police cars pull up here, stopped, the doors opened then the whole thing started,” Rafi said.

The Montgomery County Police gave the kids a stern warning about walking alone, put them in the squad car and drove them home.

“I look out and see the police and thought, ‘Oh my God, what did they do?’” said their father Alexander Meitiv. “I asked did they do something, they said ‘no,’ I said, ‘OK, I'll take my children,’ then I realized they wouldn't let me take them.”

Maryland Child Protective Services then accused the Meitivs of neglect, saying unless they committed to a safety plan, the kids would have to go into foster homes. In Silver Spring, leaving anyone under age 18 unsupervised constitutes neglect.

Before the police found them, Rafi and Dvora, ages 10 and 6, said they used to run around outside and cross the street by themselves all the time. Their parents, Alexander and Danielle Meitiv, said they trust their children and want to give them the freedom to make mistakes, away from the parental safety net.

It’s an approach known these days as “free range parenting,” which to the Meitivs is an age-old tradition.

“I'm just parenting the way I was parented and the way that almost every adult I know was parented,” Danielle said.

Suddenly this middle-class suburban family found themselves smack in the middle of a national parenting debate.

In an era of helicopter parenting, many people wouldn’t dream of letting their kids leave their sight unattended.

Plenty of parents are rightly concerned about all the menaces of modern life -- kidnappers, perverts, violent crime, a broken bone, a drunk driver, having their kids snatched or lost, or fall victim to countless other horrors.

But there is also a growing movement of parents who refuse to hover.

Lenore Skenazy is a champion of free range parenting, and stars on a reality TV show on Discovery Life.

“The concept is that I ... go to families that are extremely over-protective and nervous and I find out all the things the kids aren't allowed to do,” Skenazy said. “I make helicopter parents see what their kids can really do, stuff that they didn't believe because they never let them do it.”

The title of her new show: “World’s Worst Mom.” It’s an insult she has been called many times. ""Nightline"" first profiled Skenazy in 2009 when she let her then-9-year-old son Izzy take the New York City subway by himself.

“We thought, ‘Gee, you know, he knows the subway, he knows how to use the card that gets you on,’” she said. “We sat him down, we made sure he knew how to read a map, but he's been reading maps forever, and then we thought about the city. Is the city safe? Well our crime rate is back to 1963 and we’re talking about Sunday which is a nice, easygoing day.”

Izzy is now in high school. After that first trip, he was inspired to start pushing the boundaries further, gaining confidence and street smarts with every trip outside the nest. He is now an impressively confident, self sufficient kid.

“Just because I know my way around doesn't mean I never get lost. That's part of the fun, find my way home from somewhere that my mom drops me off, it's really helpful,” he said, adding that he’s gotten stopped by the police three times for riding the subway by himself."

Ericka Smith, a sophomore with the Middle Georgia State College basketball team, told ABC News that her school's men's and women's basketball teams boarded a bus Friday afternoon en route to Martin Methodist College in Pulaski, Tennessee, for games this weekend.

But less than an hour from their destination on Friday night, the bus driver pulled over on Interstate 65, saying the roads were too icy to safely continue.

With their hotel about three miles away, the players gathered up their belongings and started walking.

The Athens Police Department found the basketball team shortly after midnight Saturday and drove them to their hotel after they had walked about two miles.

Athens Police Chief Floyd Johnson said officers would drive the players to their bus today if the roads were safe.

Saturday afternoon, the women's team lost their game to Martin Methodist College 62-52, Smith said.

""Everything happens for a reason and we're just happy we made it safely,"" Smith said. ""Hopefully, everyone else that was stuck is OK as well.""

Icy roads have caused issues for many other drivers in Alabama.

Neil Johnson, who was traveling from Nashville to Tuscaloosa, Alabama, said he and dozens of other drivers were stuck on Interstate 65 for more than 12 hours because of accidents and icy roads. The trip, he said, usually takes about two hours."

""For the first time in the history of humanity we have the tools and technology and capability to potentially answer this question. And, we know where to go to find it,"" Kevin Hand, a NASA astrobiologist, said last year.

Getting a closer look could soon be a reality. The $18.5 billion NASA budget recently proposed by the White House for next year includes money earmarked ""for Planetary Science including formulation of a mission to Jupiter’s moon Europa.""

Under its icy shell, Europa, one of the many moons orbiting Jupiter, has an interior ocean that could perhaps be ten times deeper than those on Earth, and include two to three times the volume of all liquid water on our planet, according to Hand.

""The story of life on Earth may have begun in our oceans,"" he said in a NASA video interview. ""And that's because, of course, if we've learned anything about life on Earth it's that where you find the liquid water you generally find life.""

NASA has been experimenting with the concept of the Europa Clipper, a spacecraft that would orbit Jupiter and collect reconnaissance on Europa -- and possibly bring back signs of multi-cellular life."
1DeVO2l,2015-02-23 00:00:00,Reports: Hundreds of Spy Files Leaked - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/International/reports-hundreds-spy-files-leaked/story?id=29166922,"Two major international publications said today they will be publishing a portion of “hundreds” of leaked spy documents covering nearly the last decade, centering on South Africa’s spy agency and involving the CIA and Britain’s MI-6.

The Qatar-based news outlet Al Jazeera reported today that it obtained the documents from 2006 to late 2014 and, along with The Guardian in the U.K., will be exposing some of the files, which Al Jazeera said “offer an unprecedented insight into operational dealings of shadowy and highly politicized realm of global espionage.""

The files purportedly show the secret communications between South Africa’s State Security Agency (SSA) and its international counterparts, the CIA in America, MI-6 in Britain, Israel’s Mossad, Russia’s FSB and even Iranian operatives, “as well as dozens of other services from Asia to the Middle East and Africa.”

The announcement comes as reporters at several publications, including The Guardian, continue to dig through the enormous cache of documents leaked from the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) by contractor Edward Snowden. Whereas Snowden’s documents so far have dealt primarily with signals intelligence (SIGINT) capabilities of the NSA and its allied counterparts, Al Jazeera said their crop of documents are more focused on human intelligence, or HUMINT.

Representative at the South African Embassy in Washington, D.C. was not immediately available to comment and a spokesperson at the CIA declined to comment on the leak.

The CIA spokesperson did, however, provide a comment with regards to a story by The Guardian based on the documents alleging the Agency had tried to contact the Palestinian group Hamas in 2012 despite an official U.S. ban.

The spokesperson said, ""CIA supports the overall U.S. Government effort to combat international terrorism by collecting, analyzing, and disseminating intelligence on foreign terrorist groups and individuals.""

""CIA conducts those intelligence activities in compliance with the United States Constitution, federal statutes, and Presidential directives,"" he said.

In other reports based on the documents, Al Jazeera and the Guardian write that Israeli intelligence apparently disagreed with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu when he told the United Nations in 2012 that Iran was closing on a nuclear weapon. The outlets reported that a month after Netanyahu’s widely-noted “red line” speech, a cable showed that Mossad believed that Tehran was “not performing the activity necessary to produce weapons.”"

Reserve Officer Paul Watkins went to the McDonald's at around 10 p.m. Saturday night for a self-serve tea before his shift, his wife Jerilyn Watkins said, adding that she wasn't with him at the time and his lawyer advised him not to speak to the media.

He filled his cup halfway with unsweetened tea and went to fill the rest with sweetened tea when he noticed it looked dark, she said. He took the lid off the dispenser to take a look and determined it was OK.

""He filled his cup and took a big gulp and immediately his throat started burning down into his chest,"" Jerilyn Watkins told ABC News, adding that he called her from the car and told him he felt as though he'd just drank ""bleach.""

The owner of the McDonald's where Watkins was served, Elizabeth Henry, issued the following statement: ""Serving my customers safe, high quality food and beverages is a top priority at our restaurants. We take this claim very seriously and are looking into the matter.""

Emails to McDonald's corporate communications office seeking additional comment were not returned.

Watkins immediately spit out the tea and told the girl behind the counter that there was something wrong, Jerilyn Watkins said. The manager then told him the employees had put a cleaning solution into the tea dispenser and they had forgotten to put a cup over the nozzle, Jerilyn Watkins said.

""The irony of this all was that manager asked Paul if he wanted another cup or glass of tea and told one of the employees, 'Hey, get this guy another tea,'"" Paul Watkins's lawyer, Sam Jacobs told ABC News. ""Paul said 'No, thanks' and left. By time he got not very far in his police car, he became violently ill.""

He called the police station and poison control, which determined that the tea dispenser was filled with a ""heavy duty degreaser"" chemical, according to the police report obtained by ABC News. Watkins spent the night at IU Health Methodist Hospital, according to the report. He underwent endoscopy the following day, Jacobs said.

Watkins has returned to his daily life, but he still has problems swallowing and experiences burning in his throat, Jacobs said. He's also concerned about the long-term effects of ingesting the chemicals.

""My husband has never drank, never smoked, never done drugs,"" Jerilyn Watkins said. ""This is just insane.""

A similar scenario involving a teen in Muncie, Indiana, was reported at a McDonald's in 2013, and a lawsuit was filed in January, according to ABC's Indianapolis affiliate, RTV6. McDonald's lawyers in the case have until March 31 to respond, according to court records.

In Utah last summer, a woman said she unintentionally ingested lye by drinking contaminated tea through a straw at Dickey's Barbeque Pit, but she did not file suit, The Associated Press reported.

Dickey’s said in a statement the worker who made the tea no longer works at the company.

“The entire Dickey’s family is saddened by the events that occurred in Utah and takes this incident very seriously,” the restaurant chain said in a statement. “There is nothing more important to us than the trust and safety of our guests.”

Jacobs said he has not yet filed a lawsuit on Watkins's behalf and hopes he is able to work out something with McDonald's before doing so.

""He never wants this to happen to anybody else,"" Jacobs said."
1DfJ50q,2015-02-10 00:00:00,NYPD Officer Who Shot Brooklyn Man Indicted by Grand Jury - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/US/nypd-officer-shot-brooklyn-man-indicted-grand-jury/story?id=28869098,"A rookie New York City police officer is expected to surrender Wednesday to face criminal charges in the November shooting death of an unarmed man, according to a city official and a lawyer involved in the case.

A grand jury in Brooklyn returned an indictment today against Officer Peter Liang, who was 18 months out of the police academy when he shot and killed Akai Gurley in a dimly lit stairwell of a Brooklyn public housing project.

Police have said Liang fired by accident.

At the time of the shooting, Police Commissioner Bill Bratton called Gurley “a total innocent.”

“He just happened to be in that hallway as the officers were entering,” Bratton said at a news conference after the shooting. “He was not engaged in any criminal activity of any type.”

Liang was patrolling the stairwell of Pink Houses in East New York the morning of November 20 with his gun drawn. Police have said the gun may have jostled as he opened a door. The single bullet that killed Gurley had ricocheted off the wall.

Scott Rynecki, the attorney for Gurley’s domestic partner Kimberly Ballinger, said he was advised that Liang will surrender Wednesday and appear in court when charges would be unsealed.

“This is the first step for the family in their fight for justice in the wrongful death and shooting of Akai Gurley,” Rynecki said.

Asked about the case, the office of Mayor Bill de Blasio said in a statement: ""It has been reported that a Brooklyn grand jury has acted in this case. No matter the specific charges, this case is an unspeakable tragedy for the Gurley family. We urge everyone to respect the judicial process as it unfolds.""

Meanwhile, Brooklyn boro pres Eric Adams said: “It is my continued hope that the death of Akai Gurley will give life to much-needed reforms that will make the community and law enforcement alike safer.”

The shooting happened as emotions roiled across the country about police shootings of unarmed men. Gurley was killed around the time a grand jury in Staten Island cleared the NYPD officer primarily involved in the chokehold death of Eric Garner.

“This officer deserves the same due process afforded to anyone involved in the accidental death of another,” PBA president Patrick J. Lynch said. ""The fact the he was assigned to patrol one most dangerous housing projects in New York City must be considered among the circumstances of this tragic accident.”"

The embassy had already been operating on a reduced staff and was guarded by roughly 100 U.S. Marines.

Ambassador Matthew Tueller was one of the remaining staffers, but officials told ABC News they'll all be gone within the next 24 hours.

Shiite rebels seized the capital city of Sanaa last month and placed the president under house arrest. Since then multiple peace negotiations and proposals to reset control of the government have failed.

Meanwhile, Houthi rebels continued to grab power throughout Yemen, announcing today they have taken control of a key central province.

U.S. officials say the State Department does not plan to permanently abandon the post and there are reports that Turkey and Algeria have been delegated to protect the US embassy while its staff is relocated out of the country."
1DfPs3Z,2015-02-05 00:00:00,"In Metro-North Crash, 400 Feet of Third Rail Sliced Through Train - ABC News",http://abcnews.go.com/US/metro-north-tragedy-deadly-train-suv-collision-ugly/story?id=28710350,"Some 400 feet of the electrified third rail sliced through the first car of a Metro-North train after it plowed into an SUV stalled on the tracks, burning the entire interior of the car and killing five passengers, the head of the National Transportation Safety Board investigation confirmed this evening.

The accident, which happened during the Tuesday night commuter rush near Valhalla in suburban New York, was caused by the train hitting a Mercedes SUV that, ""for whatever reason,"" was on the tracks, NTSB vice chairman Robert Sumwalt said.

The car was ""pushed about 1,000 feet down the tracks"" and ""during that time, the third rail penetrated"" the first passenger cabin of the train, Sumwalt said. The third rail, which supplies power to the train, began breaking apart in 80-foot segments which started to pile up in the first cabin, but a section also went into the second car as well.

Sumwalt said that the crash caused a fire and explosion, and ""initial indications are that the fire was fueled by gasoline from the SUV."" It was not immediately clear how long the power stayed on when the rail entered the train car, but the NTSB said the rail is designed to deactivate if it is separated.

Sumwalt said that the NTSB investigators, who arrived this morning at the crash site about 20 miles north of Manhattan, will likely stay in the area for the next five to seven days collecting witness testimony and what he classified as ""perishable"" evidence, meaning information that may disappear or disintegrate over time.

They have already downloaded the recorders that are in place on the tracks and are calling on witnesses to come forward and share any information they have about the fatal crash.

Earlier today, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo spoke about the tragedy. “There are six people who left home and said ‘goodbye honey’ and never came back,” he said. He called the accident a “truly ugly and brutal sight.”

Co-workers later identified the driver of the car as Ellen Brody, a mother of three from Edgemont, New York. Among the dead on the train were Joseph Nadol, 42, of Ossining, Robert Dirks, 36, of Chappaqua, Walter Liedtke of Bedford Hills, Eric Vandercar, 53, of Bedford Hills, and Aditya Tomar, 41, of Danbury, Connecticut.

Cuomo added that the electrified third rail of the track buckled and pierced the front train car.

“You had a metal rail going right down the train like a ramrod,” Cuomo said. “That’s what caused massive destruction.”

Twelve people injured in the crash were taken to Westchester Medical Center -- and as of early this afternoon, one was in critical condition, one was in serious condition, four were fair, two were good and four had been discharged, hospital officials said. Injuries included lacerations, contusions, crush injuries, fractures, smoke inhalation and burns.

Westchester County Executive Rob Astorino said today that all but one of those killed were charred beyond recognition. Families were gathering around 10 a.m. at the medical examiner’s office to make positive identifications, but Astorino believed medical and dental records would be needed.

“That train had so many flames in it, it was so engulfed, the inside of that first car is just melted and charred,"" Astorino said.

Citing an eyewitness quoted by local media, Astorino said the preliminary, unconfirmed indication was that the railroad crossing gate came down on the vehicle involved in the accident, the female driver got out to put the gate up, and then she drove forward instead of in reverse and into the path of the oncoming train. He noted that traffic may have been backed up in the area because of another accident on the Taconic State Parkway.

Cuomo told ABC News in a radio interview that “it would be apparently inexplicable” if the driver pulled forward onto the track and into the path of the oncoming train.

“If there’s a lesson to learn we’ll learn it,” Cuomo said. “But sometimes accidents happen and human beings can act randomly.”

Initially, officials reported the car involved in the accident was a Jeep SUV, but they later said it was a Mercedes.

The National Transportation Safety Board launched a go-team to investigate the accident, which is the deadliest tragedy in the history of the railroad.

NTSB board member Robert Sumwalt said this morning that officials have secured event recorders for the train itself, as well as for train and highway signals near the crash, and the agency has sent experts to analyze the recorders. The NTSB team also includes technical experts who can examine areas such as track and highway factors, emergency response and fire science. The NTSB expects to gather evidence at the scene for five to seven days, starting with the most perishable evidence, for an investigation that could last a year.

“Our goal is not only to find what happened, but to find out why it happened,” Sumwalt said. ""We go there and we cast a wide net. ... At this point, everything is on the table. Nothing is off the table.”

Angelo Ortiz, one of the first paramedics on the scene, had trouble putting the accident into context hours afterwards.

""What I first saw was the glow of the fire down the road. And as I approached I was in disbelief when I saw the fire was coming from the car that was completely engulfed. When I knew it was the train that was on fire as well, that's when I realized that this is probably the worst tragedy I've ever responded to,"" Ortiz said.

""It was incredibly, just very tragic. That's all I can say. I'm still in disbelief,""

Rick Hope, a driver who said he saw the train hit the SUV, said he saw the events preceding the accident that Astorino and other officials described.

“She looked very calm and she was taking what I thought was an awful long time because I'm thinking, ‘The clock is ticking here.’ The lights are flashing. The gate's down. You don't have much time,” Hope told ABC News.

The verdict came after a 19-month-long trial in which Schettino, who had been accused of causing the Jan. 13, 2012 shipwreck near the Italian island of Giglio, was charged with multiple counts of manslaughter and abandoning ship before all 4,200 passengers could be safely evacuated.

As part of the sentence, Schettino will not be allowed to command a ship for five years.

Investigators had harshly criticized Schettino's handling of the crash before and during the trial -- accusing him of bringing the vessel too close to shore when it struck rocks off the Tuscan island, tearing a hole in its side and causing the death of 32 people.

Prosecutors had requested for the maximum sentence of 26 years, but instead got 16 years and one month by the three-judge panel in the city of Grosetto, where the trial took place.

Schettino, 54, did not appear in court as a judge read the verdict.

Lawyers for many of the survivors and victims' families have attached civil suits to the criminal trial as a way to press the court to order Costa Crociere, the Italian cruise company that operated the ship, to pay hefty damages.

The judge did say Schettino and the cruise company had to pay damages and legal fees as part of the guilty, but did not go into specifics.

While insisting Schettino deserves to be convicted, the plaintiffs' lawyers have lamented to the court that no one from the cruise company's upper echelons was put on trial.

Prosecutors had insisted Schettino was a ""reckless idiot"" and asked the judges to convict him and sentence him to 26 years and three months in prison.

Four Concordia crew members and the boat's land-based crisis coordinator were allowed to plea bargain. None is serving prison time.

The photo went viral through the hashtag #Superb_Owl after wildlife refuge specialist Katie McVey posted the photo during the Super Bowl.

The photos are actually a few years old from when McVey was doing graduate research at Boise State University with the Raptor Biology Program, according to a statement from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS).

Burrowing owls are considered a species of concern in most U.S. states because their numbers are shrinking, the USFWS wrote, citing loss or alteration of habitat as the key reason.

""That's actually why the baby owls at top are in a 5-gallon bucket,"" the USFWS said. The organization added the colorful bands on the owls in the photo will help researchers identify the birds when they fly away.

Burrowing owls are unique from many other owls in that they live in tunnels and hiss when threatened, according to the USFWS."

“The prime minister of Israel is welcome to speak in the United States, obviously,” Kerry said today in an exclusive interview on ABC’s ""This Week."" “I talk to the prime minister regularly, including yesterday.""

But, Kerry added, ""we don't want to see this turned into some great political football.”

Kerry echoed frustrations expressed by the White House that House Speaker John Boehner’s invitation to Netanyahu was inappropriate.

“It was odd, if not unique, that we learned of it from the speaker of the House and that an administration was not included in this process,"" he said. ""But the administration is not seeking to politicize this.”

But Kerry’s remarks were far more measured than those of National Security Advisor Susan Rice, who said last week that the speech would be “destructive to the fabric of the relationship.”

The White House has expressed anger with both the Republican-led House of Representatives and with Netanyahu’s office, not only for excluding them from the invitation process, but also for making the invitation so close to Israel’s elections on March 17 and the final stages of a potential American nuclear weapons deal with Iran.

Yet, while departing Israel for Washington, D.C., on Sunday morning, the prime minister seemed to be brimming with confidence. Speaking in Hebrew to reporters at the airport, Netanyahu called it a “crucial and even historical mission.”

“I feel I am representing all the citizens of Israel, even those who do not agree with me,” Netanyahu said. “I feel a deep and sincere concern for the safety of all the citizens of Israel and the fate of the state and the fate of our people. I will do everything in my power to secure our future.""

The prime minister’s critics say he’s too hawkish on Iran and that he’s been warning for decades they are on the cusp of building a bomb. His supporters say a U.S. nuclear deal with Iran won’t work and that the only way to stop them is to punish them with further economic sanctions. Even many House Democrats say that they will vote for further sanctions if a deal isn’t reached by the end of the month.

Kerry told ""This Week"" that the negotiations with Iran have benefited Israel.

“Israel is safer today because of the interim agreement that we created,” he said. “The 20 percent enriched uranium has been reduced to zero. We have stopped the centrifuge production. We are inspecting inside of their facilities. We have stopped the Arak plutonium reactor in its tracks.”

Kerry also said the defense relationship with Israel has never been stronger.

“We have a closer relationship with Israel right now in terms of security than at any time in history,"" he said. ""I was reviewing the record the other day - we have intervened on Israel's behalf, in the last two years, more than several hundred - a couple of hundred times in over 75 different fora in order to protect Israel.”

After the interview, Kerry left Washington for Geneva, Switzerland, where he’ll be attempting this week to finalize and nuclear deal with Iran.

Jennifer Houle was last seen Friday at a bar in the Dinkytown area of Minneapolis between 1 a.m. and 2 a.m., the Minneapolis Police Department said.

Friends said they think Houle, 22, left the bar to walk home. Police said they found her purse and her phone in the middle of the street near her apartment building, just an hour and a half after she was last seen at the bar.

Houle is a member of the Pi Beta Phi sorority, and chapter posted on Facebook Saturday: ""We need all the help we can get to find this warm-hearted, beautiful person.""

""She's an amazing sister and friend to all of us,"" said Madeline Eddy. ""She's very involved.""

Police said they have been interviewing witnesses, including an ex-boyfriend, and are scanning surveilance videos from the area looking for any clues to what happened.

Houshi Ryokan, a Japanese inn that opened in the Ishikawa prefecture in 718, has been managed by 46 generations of the Houshi family during its 1,300 years of operation.

Descended from a Buddhist monk, the family has traditionally passed down management of the inn to its eldest sons. But after Zengoro and wife Chizuko Houshi's own son passed away unexpectedly in 2013, the family has since decided to buck convention and turn the reins over to their younger daughter, Hisae.

""I now have many unimaginable responsibilities,"" Hisae told The Atlantic, acknowledging that she had previously planned to move away and work in a different field. ""It is a heavy burden on my mind.""

But the legacy and future of the inn require her to now stay with her family.

""In 1994 Houshi was recognized as the oldest hotel in the world by the publishers of The Guinness Book of Records,"" the Houshi website reads.

The title has since been claimed by another Japanese property.

""We did recognize Houshi Ryokan in Japan until we were made aware of the current record holder,"" said Anthony Yodice, a spokesperson for Guinness World Records. ""The oldest hotel is the Nisiyama Onsen Keiunkan in Yamanashi, Japan, a hot-spring hotel, which has been operating since 705 AD. – this was made official in 2011.""

Still, the family-run Houshi lodge maintains its appeal. Throughout its tenure, the property has been visited by emperors, dignitaries, geishas and many families drawn to its hot spring, spa, signature wagashi confection and bucolic setting."

It's one-minute spot ""Lost Dog"" features an adorable puppy and its cross-species friendship theme once again.

The role of the Budweiser Clydesdale trainer is reprised for a third time by actor Don Jeanes.

Will the ad motivate viewers to drink beer? Probably not, but Budweiser is at least hoping you'll use the hashtag #BestBuds and feel warm and cuddly about it.

Paired with the song “I’m Gonna Be (500 Miles),” performed by Sleeping At Last, the puppy-horse combination may elicit a tear or two.

Though the ad looks like it uses one irresistible puppy, it used eight: seven females and one male, who were all 11 to 12.5 weeks old at filming.

And seven Budweiser Clydesdales underwent training for three months to fine-tune their skills for the ad, Budweiser said."

A job posting to man the ""Penguin Post Office"" in Port Lockroy, Antarctica, has received a record number of applicants: more than 1,500 since Feb. 16. In 2014, there were only 82 applicants all year long.

United Kingdom Antarctic Heritage Trust (UKAHT) is looking for four people to, in addition to taking care of the 70,000 cards posted each year for delivery to 100 countries, monitor the impact of the approximately 18,000 visitors to Port Lockroy, situated on Goudier Island in the Antarctic Peninsula, on the wildlife, plus record the number of visitors and ships visiting the area.

One reason for the increase in applications, the organization said, was the airing of the documentary ""Penguin Post Office"" on BBC2 in the U.K. in July 2014 and on PBS in the U.S. in January 2015.

Each year, the UKAHT’s U.K. team -- based in Cambridge -- searches for committed individuals to make up a small team of four to spend five months at its flagship site, Port Lockroy, situated on Goudier Island in the Antarctic Peninsula. The job runs from November 2015 to mid-March and pay is $1,700 per month.

Job Description:

""The team chosen to spend the 2015/16 season at Port Lockroy will assist the Base Leader in the efficient running of the post office, maintenance and museum operation, with areas of responsibility being divided up amongst team members. A can-do attitude is vital as is good physical fitness, co-ordination (carrying heavy boxes over slippery rocks and slushy snow whilst dodging the local gentoo penguin population is a frequent requirement), environmental awareness and a practical knowledge of minimum impact living. Above all successful candidates need to be passionate about the Antarctic.""

No post office experience is necessary and applicants need not be British citizens.

Amy Kincaid, a member of the current team, said applicants need to be ""realistic."" She called the living quarters (pictured) ""surprisingly cozy,"" though added that ""being confined to an island the size of a football pitch isn’t for everyone.""

Interested applicants can apply here. Deadline is midnight Friday."

James Jones, Jr., 21, a junior studying chemistry, had responded to an ad in Craigslist to buy the phone on Monday night in Marietta, Georgia, about 20 miles north from his school.

""It was an illegitimate ad he was responding to and he did not know the sellers,"" Marietta Police officer David Baldwin told ABC News, adding that the posting appeared to be real. ""The ad was posted in the hopes to lure somebody in, but obviously the victim didn't know that.""

Three men were in custody by noon on Tuesday: Jordan Baker, 18; Jonathon Myles, 19; and Kaylnn Ruthenberg, 21. They were charged with felony murder, armed robbery and aggravated assault and were booked into the Cobb County adult detention center, according to police. A judge at Cobb County Magistrate court denied their bond at their first appearance today. They have not yet entered a plea.

A court clerk told ABC News she was not aware if the defendants have hired attorneys.

Jones’ brother called him a “bright young man” who wanted to be a doctor.

“My mother lost her son. My sister lost her brother. I lost my brother. So I don’t think we can put that into words. There was a lot of heartache,” Jones’ brother Samuel Heath said.

Jones was shot and killed while he was sitting in his car, Baldwin said.

""After he was shot, the car went forward, hit another car and a tree,"" Baldwin said.

Police were originally dispatched to the area with a report of a motor vehicle accident.

""Through the course of the investigation, they discovered that he was going to that area in response to a Craigslist ad,"" Baldwin said.

Jones was a native of Daytona Beach, Florida, and maintained a cumulative 3.08 GPA, according to Clark Atlanta University.

""This is a devastating loss for the Clark Atlanta University family,"" a statement from the university read. ""Mr. Jones was a serious scholar and a kind, engaging spirit whose work and comportment spoke well of the university's core values and those instilled long ago by those contributing to his upbringing. In addition to his studies, he was a UPS scholar at Fickett Elementary School and a science mentor for the HBCU Rising Cares Mentoring program at Brown Middle School. He also was an amateur athlete.""

Baldwin said police ""didn’t stop until all three were arrested.""

""It was a heck of an undertaking and investigation but it helps to bring closure to the family. We hope to give them peace to know that everyone involved in this senseless murder will be held accountable,"" Baldwin said.

Craigslist did not immediately respond to ABC News’ request for comment.

A private memorial service will be held on Thursday at noon for the university community and family."

One California couple has turned their wedding into an epic journey through 12 countries over 79 days.

Cheetah Platt and Rhiann Woodyard decided they wanted to do something more for their wedding than a day-long ceremony and reception. The couple instead decided to get hitched in 12 different countries, holding at least 20 ceremonies during their travels, according to their fundraising site.

The couple jetted off on Feb. 8 and aren't expected to return homeward until April 28. According to their Facebook pages and Flickr, the couple has held multiple ceremonies, including near the great pyramids of Egypt and in the jungle of Colombia.

""The most powerful experience for [me] was standing in the ancient Egyptian desert and getting married in front of the great pyramids,"" Platt told ABC News station WLS-TV in Chicago. ""The only standing structure of the seven wonders of the ancient world. They are so majestic, awe-inspiring and rooted in such myth and legend. It was truly a breathtaking wedding.""

The couple didn't ask for gifts for their unorthodox wedding. Instead, they created a fundraising site for their honeymoon on Honeyfund, allowing the couple to plan a trip to all seven continents, including Antarctica.

The couple wrote on their site that they were both ordained so that they could perform their wedding ceremonies themselves.

""This wedding has been the greatest experience of my life,"" Platt told WLS-TV.

Since couple are both acrobats, according to WLS, they have also showed off a few daredevil tricks during their travels, including impressive lifts and headstands across the globe.

The couple's adventure has already started to go viral on social media and might have also inspired a few other couples. Today, Platt wrote on his Facebook that they gave advice to one bride-to-be.

""Just finished an amazing Skype call with a bride in New England who says our story has helped inspire them to completely rework their wedding plans,"" wrote Platt. ""It was So amazing to hear, and so moving. I've spent too much time crying tears of joy tonight."""

The oldest man in Australia spends his time knitting tiny wool sweaters for tiny, injured penguins.

The prolific knitter told Australia's Channel Nine News that when Phillip Island’s Penguin Foundation requested the tiny sweaters following a massive oil spill that injured hundreds of Little Penguins, a species only found in southern Australia and New Zealand, he couldn’t refuse.

""The girls who used to work for me, they'll tell you I'm a sucker. I can't say no,” Date told Nine News.

""It's a good way of getting along in life. You make friends all the time but you don't make a fool of yourself either,” he added.

Date has been knitting for more than 80 years, but this was his first foray into bird knitwear. The Penguin Foundation stresses to eager knitters that “this is not a fashion statement"" -- the sweaters actually prevent the injured penguins from preening and swallowing the toxic oil.

The foundation dubbed Date their “most senior little penguin jumper knitter,"" but they didn’t realize Date was also the most senior Australian citizen.

""It's amazing and we feel quite privileged to have him dedicating his time and effort to the Penguin Foundation,” a spokesperson told Nine News.

But settle down young knitters, according to the Foundation’s website, they ""have plenty of penguin jumpers at this time donated by generous knitters across the globe… and do not need any further donations at this time.”"

When physician and scientist Dr. Julielynn Y. Wong spotted the flight suit hanging on the store's wall, she ""asked the salesgirl to bring it down so I could have a closer look,"" Wong, a former ABC News digital reporter, told ABC News today.

The flight suit was on sale for $40, marked down from an original $80.

""I'm surprised nobody had bought it earlier,"" Wong said.

But it wasn't the price that shocked her. It was the name tag of former astronaut Chris Hadfield.

""When I saw his name, my jaw just dropped,"" she said.

Wong, who called Hadfield ""an inspiration to me,"" actually met the astronaut in 2012 while she was training in space medicine at the NASA Johnson Space Center in Houston.

""I was like wow, I know Chris, I trained with him, we actually had lunch. I should just reach out to Chris and ask if it belongs to him,"" Wong said.

Over Facebook message, Wong sent Hadfield photos and descriptions of the flight suit.

Hadfield concluded over Facebook message, ""You have brought my actual flight suit!"" Wong recalled.

While the flight suit wasn't worn in space, Wong said, it appeared to be the same suit Hadfield wore on the back of his book, ""An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth.""

Hadfield ""has no idea"" how the suit ended up in the store, Wong said.

""Hadfield is a former Air Force fighter pilot so he's had many flight suits over the years,"" Wong said. ""It's possible that it inadvertently got placed in a donations bag when he moved back to Canada after living abroad for 20 years.""

Hadfield, who was assigned to NASA by the Canadian Space Agency (CSA), had jobs ranging Chief Astronaut for the CSA to Chief of International Space Station Operations, according to the CSA.

Hadfield's background also includes working with the Canadian Armed Forces, attending the United States Air Force Test Pilot School and serving as an exchange officer with the U. S. Navy, according to the CSA.

Hadfield has retired from the Canadian Air Force and the CSA.

Wong said Hadfield ""told me he's glad I ended up with [the suit].""

Wong, who is also director of 3D4MD, a platform of 3D printable medical supplies, says she hopes to use the suit as a prop during her talks about 3D printing medical supplies in space and on Earth.

""This way, the flight suit is much more inspiring for the next generation of space pioneers and innovators,"" she said.

ABC News' request for comment from Chris Hadfield was not immediately returned."

Mike Heim, a 15-year veteran of the Solomons Volunteer Rescue Squad and Fire Department in Solomons, Maryland, was 30 minutes away from the end of a 12-hour shift Friday morning when a call came in around 5:30 a.m. for a house fire.

Heim joined his colleagues on the fire truck but soon after arriving at the fire, he realized the blaze was burning down his own home.

“He was hooking up to the hydrant and didn’t realize it was house until he started walking up to it,” the department’s public information officer, Norman Rea, told ABC News. “But he saw his friends and buddies battling the house fire so he still jumped on the line and helped out.

“Even in his emotional state he was still doing his job,” Rea added.

The fire, which took hours to fully extinguish, was caused by an electrical malfunction in one of the home’s bedrooms, a Maryland State Fire Marshal regional supervisor confirmed to ABC News.

All that was left for Heim to salvage from his home were a coffee container, a brass nozzle from an old fire truck, a photo album and a copy of The Book of Mormon that was found nearly unscathed in the same bedroom where the fire started.

No one was injured in the fire as Heim, described by Rea as in his 40s and a part-time handyman, lived alone.

“Thank God he didn’t go home,” Rea said of Heim, who unable to speak with ABC News today.

In order to help Heim, Rea and his fellow firefighters have started a GoFundMe page and are also accepting PayPal donations on the department’s website.

“Right now he has his own space at the firehouse and we’re taking care of him day-by-day,” Rea said. “We’re making sure he has food and other firefighters have gone out to buy him some clothes.

“He’s pretty emotional but he’s back on the trucks, going to help other people. This guy doesn’t stop,” Rea added. “He’s hurting on the inside but he’s still out there to help everybody.”

Heim’s colleagues have already raised $14,000 of their $50,000 goal on GoFundMe since launching the page five days ago. The donations have come from nearly 300 people, many of whom are community members or complete strangers who say they are firefighters themselves.

“It’s now our community, everyone around here,” Rea said, “It’s our turn to rescue him.”"

Amazon is obsessed with dreaming up ways to get goods to customers even faster in the future and in a newly filed patent application, the company revealed how its hypothetical trucks would be able to print goods while traveling to deliver them to the customer.

While 3D printers don't cover everything on Amazon's site, the idea would be for customers to place an order for something, such as a spare part.

Amazon wouldn't have to store the inventory and would instead 3-D print what was needed on demand, and deliver it to the customer even faster.

Amazon declined ABC News' request for comment on the proposed delivery system.

Earlier this month, the company's vision of drones delivering goods hit another roadblock when the Federal Aviation Administration released new proposals for commercial drone operations, but with several caveats that would keep Amazon Prime Air from become a reality.

While the rules could take as long as two years to be adopted, they seem to be a significant roadblock on Amazon's plans to create a drone delivery network that CEO Jeff Bezos has said he hopes will one day be as common as seeing a mail truck.

""Based on the proposal, even then those rules wouldn't allow Prime Air to operate in the United States,"" Paul Misener, vice president of global public policy at Amazon, said in a statement to ABC News.

""The FAA needs to begin and expeditiously complete the formal process to address the needs of our business, and ultimately our customers. We are committed to realizing our vision for Prime Air and are prepared to deploy where we have the regulatory support we need,"" he said."

They had lived face-to-face, heart-to-heart, sharing every breath as conjoined twins since they were born 10 months ago. But to give them both a chance at an independent life, the two infant girls underwent a highly complicated and risky surgery at Texas Children’s Hospital in Houston to be separated.

Each separation surgery is different, and presents its own challenges and potential complications. Texas Children's Hospital officials said they hadn't performed a separation surgery this complicated before. But the twins’ parents, Elysse and Eric Mata, decided they had no other choice than to put their babies through the surgery.

“I want to give them a shot at a normal life as much as possible,” Elysse Mata said. “I feel like they've come this far, why hold back? Why not follow through? Why not give them that chance?”

That Knatalye and Adeline have made it this far is remarkable. Roughly 200,000 conjoined twins are born each year. As many as 60 percent of conjoined twins are stillborn, and about 35 percent only survive one day. Past that, conjoined twins have a 5 to 25 percent chance of survival.

“Nightline” was there as a team of 12 surgeons spent 26 hours performing the separation surgery on Knatalye and Adeline last Tuesday and Wednesday, and also with the Mata family, as they received updates on their daughters’ condition.

Watch the full story, including the twins' surgery, on ""Nightline"" tonight at 12:35 a.m. ET

Elysse and Eric had been waiting for that day since they first found out during an ultrasound they were expecting twins.

“I looked at my husband, he was just like, you know, jaw drop,” Elysse said. “Then, [the doctor] said, ‘But we think they're conjoined.’ And my heart sunk in that moment and I just froze… I was like, ‘this can't be real.’”

The two infant girls were conjoined from the ribcage down to their pelvis, and some of their internal organs, including their liver and lungs, were fused together.

When she found out the twins were conjoined, Elysse, 25, said, doctors talked to her about terminating the pregnancy, but she said that was never an option.

“I told him, ‘I don't care what the case is, I'm going to go as long as I can, and if God decides that he needs them more, then so be it,’” she said.

But there was hope once doctors learned the girls each had their own hearts, beating separately on their own.

On April 11, 2014, the two sisters beat the odds and were born alive, nine weeks premature, at Texas Children’s Hospital. Eric and Elysse decided to give the girls meaningful middle names: Hope and Faith.

“It was heaven on earth, just to be able to hold them so close to me,” Elysse said. “Everybody talks about when they see their baby, they don't count their toes, they just see a baby… I just saw two miracle angels laying there, peacefully sleeping.”

But after they were born, the babies had to stay in the intensive care unit until the surgery, so Eric, 29, Elysse, and their 5-year-old son, Azariah, uprooted their lives in Lubbock, Texas, to live in an RV near the Houston hospital. Eric commuted eight hours each way from Lubbock to see his wife, son and newborn babies.

Over the next few months, the babies thrived in the NICU, but a team of nurses performed everyday tasks, such as bathing and diaper changing.

At 10 months old, doctors determined the girls had a good chance of surviving the separation surgery, so a team, led by Dr. Darrell Cass, began to prepare. They spent months creating 3-D models of the babies’ insides and practiced on mannequins. Despite all the preparation, there was still a chance the girls would die in surgery.

“Separating conjoined twins is a very complicated task and there are lots of risks involved, and death is absolutely one of those risks,” Cass said."

Today, the Academy has released a statement about the omission, telling USA Today, ""Joan Rivers is among the many worthy artists and filmmakers we were unfortunately unable to feature in the In Memoriam segment of this year's Oscar show. She is, however, included in our In Memoriam gallery on Oscar.com.""

Instead, the Oscars honored Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Maya Angelou, alongside such industry figures as Mickey Rooney, Robin Williams and Lauren Bacall.

While the show left Rivers out, her daughter Melissa Rivers made sure to pay tribute right as E! began its red carpet coverage of the night.

The network started off with River's ""Fashion Police"" co-star Giuliana Rancic saying a few words about her mentor and ""dear friend"" -- then throwing it Melissa so she could share some precious memories of her late mother.

A montage of Rivers' hilarious quips at past red carpets played before Melissa said, ""It's hard to believe it was 20 years ago that my mother and I stood on this very red carpet for the first time. We didn't know that walking into a building [the red carpet] was turning into an event.""

The ""Fashion Police"" producer said her mother, who died this past September at the age of 81, asked the ""personal"" questions that no one else would at the time.

Melissa shared how tough and cramped it was for Joan to make the red carpet as iconic as it became.

""I think the reason everybody loved talking to my mother, was just like the people who sit in these bleachers, because she was a true fan,"" she said. ""So here I am 20 years later, one last Oscar, one last red carpet, and one last time to say, 'Back to you mom.'""

The segment closed with Joan saying, ""Goodbye, my friends"" and blowing a kiss. It's something she would have loved."

Craig Stephen Hicks, 46, was charged with three counts of first-degree murder and ordered held without bail Wednesday morning.

His wife, Karen Hicks, said she was shocked at the news of the event and that she believed the incident was not religiously motivated.

“We were married for seven years and that is one thing that I do know about him,"" Karen Hicks told reporters today. ""He often champions on his Facebook page for the rights of many individuals -- for same-sex marriages, abortion, race. He just believed -- I know that’s just one of the things I know about him is that everyone is just equal.”

Hicks' attorney Rob Maitland said his client had a ""longstanding issue"" with parking, saying, ""it has nothing to do with the religious faith"" of the victims.

“Unfortunately these victims were there at the wrong time at the wrong place,"" Maitland said.

""Our preliminary investigation indicates that the crime was motivated by an ongoing neighbor dispute over parking,"" Chapel Hill Police said in a statement. ""Hicks is cooperating with investigators and more information may be released at a later time.""

Police earlier said they were investigating whether the shooting was a hate crime. All three victims were Muslim.

Duke University’s Imam Abdullah Antepli said, “This may or may not be a hate crime,” adding that authorities have been “extremely helpful and supportive.”

U.S. Attorney in North Carolina Ripley Rand said, ""We don't have any information that this was a targeted campaign against Muslims in North Carolina.”

Two of the victims -- Deah Barakat, 23, a second-year student in UNC's School of Dentistry, and Yusor Mohammad, 21, a prospective dental student -- were married. Mohammad's sister, Razan Mohammad Abu-Salha, was a sophomore at North Carolina State University in Raleigh and was visiting her sister and brother-in-law, according to Deah Barakat's father.

Gunshots were reported after 5 p.m. Tuesday in the Finley Forest condominiums in Chapel Hill, east of the University of North Carolina campus.

Farris Barakat, Deah Barakat's brother, said Hicks had confronted his brother previously about a dispute over a parking space, adding that he never heard Hicks make any anti-Muslim remarks.

When Farris Barakat had visited his brother, Hicks had yelled at him, telling him he was parking in the wrong space, Farris Barakat told ABC News. Farris Barakat added that he tried to respond in a calm manner, not wanting to upset Hicks further, and said his brother also treated Hicks in a respectful manner.

Hicks showed up at Barakat and Mohammad's home in the past with a gun on his belt, and Mohammad had confided that she was afraid of Hicks, Farris Barakat said. The two joked that maybe she should get a gun, he added.

The nation's largest Muslim civil rights organization, The Council on American-Islamic Relations, requested law enforcement authorities address speculation about a possible bias motive in the homicide.

Information about the shooting was heavily shared on social media, fueling hashtags such as #MuslimLivesMatter and #ChapelHillShooting to trend across the United States."

Jill Mindlin's daughter used to say when she was a toddler, running around the kitchen and holding up the food she wanted to eat.

At 3 years old, Maya already knew that if an adult didn't read the ingredients, she could have a deadly allergic reaction to the food she ate, Mindlin said. The first time Maya went into anaphylactic shock, she was just 9 months old, and doctors soon learned she was allergic to peanuts, tree nuts, eggs, dairy and sesame seeds. Like most parents, Mindlin wondered if it was her fault.

Peanut allergies in particular have doubled in the last 10 years, so a team of researchers with funding from the National Institutes of Health and the nonprofit group Food Allergy Research and Education set out to see whether early exposure to peanuts played a role in developing peanut allergies.

They followed hundreds of children from the time they showed a slight sensitivity to peanuts -- between 6 and 11 months old -- until they were 5 years old. Those who avoided peanuts were more likely to develop full-blown peanut allergies than those who didn't, according to the study published today in the New England Journal of Medicine.

Only 1.9 percent of those who were exposed to peanuts early developed the allergies compared with 13.7 of those who developed allergies after avoiding peanuts, the study showed.

Dr. Stacy Dorris, an allergist and immunologist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee, called the study ""exciting."" Dorris was not involved in the study, but said prior to 2008, parents were told to avoid feeding their children peanuts until they were about 2 years old. That year, evidence in Israel began to hint that perhaps early exposure to peanuts might prevent the allergies, she said.

""I think it's really going to be a game-changer for the allergy world,"" said Dr. Samuel Friedlander, an allergy and immunology specialist at the University Hospitals in Cleveland, who was not involved in the study. ""Up until now, we've been focused on diagnosis and management of children that have food allergies. This is the first randomized, controlled study that gives us evidence that we can prevent the occurrence of food allergies in kids. It would be much easier for us to be able to prevent the development of food allergies in the first place.""

Mindlin's daughter Maya is now nearly 14 years old and doing well. While any new research is positive, Mindlin said she has some advice to parents: Don't feel guilty.

""We were told for so many years to avoid the allergens, and now the science turns around 180 degrees,"" she said. ""You're darned if you do, you're darned if you don't. Let go of the guilt."""
1DJXmD4,2015-02-12 00:00:00,7-Year-Old Cancer Patient Makes Adorable Argument for Vaccines - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Health/boy-battled-leukemia-lobbies-vaccinated-students/story?id=28919133,"A young boy who fought through leukemia is now fighting to keep unvaccinated children out of school.

After spending over three years going through chemotherapy, Rhett Krawitt, 7, remains unprotected against certain illnesses, including the measles. So the boy and his family this week asked his local school district to support new legislation that would abolish personal-belief exemptions, which allow families to opt out of required vaccinations, according to ABC station KGO-TV in San Francisco.

To speak to the Reed Union School District, the boy stood on a chair to reach the microphone.

""Soon we will say Gone with the Measles,"" he said. ""My name is Rhett and I give a damn!""

Rhett and his Corte Madera, California, family asked the Reed Union School District to support state legislation introduced by state senator and pediatrician Dr. Richard Pan that would abolish personal-belief exemptions that allow students to attend school without being fully vaccinated. For the current school year, 5.89 percent of kindergartners in Marin County have a personal-belief exemption.

The family first made headlines last month after NPR reported they asked their local school districts to ban unvaccinated children from the school after a measles outbreak started in Southern California. Rhett attends school in Marin County in California, where just over 84 percent of kindergartners are fully vaccinated, according to the California Department of Public Health.

""The importance of vaccinations is about the expectant mothers and babies under the age one and hundreds of children who are at risk for getting these disease that don’t even need to be here,"" Carl Krawitt told ABC News. ""It’s really around making sure that we have public health policy that protects everyone in our community.""

The multistate outbreak of measles that started in Disneyland in December has infected at least 121 people, with 99 of those infections in California, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

After the family’s plea, the school district voted to support legislation introduced by Pan.

Carl Krawitt also told ABC News that son Rhett will meet with his doctors to determine whether his immune system is healthy enough to get a measles vaccination.

Krawitt said the importance of vaccinations was underscored again Wednesday after the Contra Costa Public Health Department alerted Bay Area California residents that a passenger on the Bay Area Rapid Transport (BART) public transportation system has been infected with measles, meaning other passengers could have been exposed to the contagious virus.

""I’m not going to take BART on Saturday and I really wanted to,"" Krawitt said. ""There are certain things we will and won’t do"" to protect Rhett."

Meanwhile, Arctic air is returning to the Northeast, with chilling temperatures expected later today from Boston to Washington, D.C., following a milder Sunday reprieve.

At least 15 states from North Dakota to Maryland are under a wind chill advisory today. Wind chills in parts of the Midwest could drop to -40 degrees. Wind chill figures in the inland Northeast Tuesday could fall to similar figures -- near -35 degrees.

One wave of the system moved through the deep south Sunday, producing multiple accidents and spin-offs in Texas and leading authorities at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport and airlines to take extra precautions. A second round of freezing precipitation is expected in the Dallas area during the morning rush hour, with dangerous travel conditions expected.

In Colorado, people used cross-country skis, sleds and snowshoes as more than 2 feet of snow fell.

Additionally, a new storm system in the Southwest is expected to bring rain and snow to California, Nevada and Arizona.

Toms River resident Bill Bresnan, 74, has written a love letter every day to Kirsten Bresnan, 74, his wife of almost 40 years, and there are more than 10,000 of them filed chronologically in 25 boxes at their home.

And he continues to write them to this day.

""All the letters are signed, 'I love you, my darling' with an infinity sign,"" Bresnan told ABC News today. ""They're essentially a love diary. For example, I could pick out a day in 1982, and it’ll begin with the restaurant we ate in or a movie we saw and then a reaction to that.""

The daily expressions of love began as notes scribbled on napkins and small pieces of paper he gave to his wife over coffee while commuting together shortly after they met, Bresnan said. They met while he was teaching a class to license students in the security industry.

""She was this beautiful Northern European woman who struck me like a bolt of lightning,"" he said.

Their relationship blossomed. They had a simple wedding in the city and have lived happily ever after since, he said.

""We've never had a fight once in almost 40 years of marriage,"" Bresnan said. ""We might disagree on something, but we talk about it rather than argue.""

Bresnan's never a missed giving Kirsten a card, he said. Even when they're away, he makes sure to send postcards or write letters in advance.

""My biggest fear now, given my age, is forgetting -- but luckily I'm still pretty sharp,"" he said.

One of his favorites out of the 10,000-plus letters were a series of 50 cards, one for each of the 50 days before her 50th birthday, he said.

The daily cards are part of Bresnan's recipe for making a relationship last, among other things, he said.

""The key to any relationship is that you both have to work at it every day,"" Bresnan said. ""And never go to bed mad. Talk about everything. Everything should get resolved before your goodnight kiss.""

The couple continues to keep the romance alive through little things they do together in their daily routine, such as playing 'Boggle' over breakfast and having candlelit dinners with wine, he said.

Bresnan also goes big once in a while.

""We once reenacted the Katherine Hepburn movie 'Summertime'"" Bresnan said. ""I took Kirsten to Italy. We sailed across the Mediterranean, took a train to Venice, wandered the city, had pizza at San Marco Piazza and literally did everything in that movie together.""

He also gave her a friendship ring featuring hieroglyphics he saw during a trip to Egypt that were an expression of a pharaoh's eternal love for his son.

Despite the countless good times, the couple has weathered many a storm together, as well, he said.

""When the doctor told me I had cancer a few years ago, Kirsten was right next to me holding my hand,"" Bresnan said. ""It wasn't, 'You have cancer,"" it was, 'We have cancer.' And I did the same thing for her when she got cancer a few years later.""

Bresnan hopes that their love story will hope inspire younger couples, who seem to be more in love with their gadgets, he said.

""I see youngsters at restaurants sitting across from each other buried in their screens but never talking or looking at each other,"" Bresnan said. ""I want them to enjoy the time they have with each other and treasure it.""

Though Bresnan has already sent his wife plenty of Valentine's Day cards before the date, he said they'll still do something simple to celebrate.

""We'll probably have a nice dinner, a special bottle of wine and a piece of chocolate,"" Bresnan said. ""We're past the craving for jewelry and expensive nonsense. We just enjoy simply being together."""

Korea Warns of 'Merciless Strikes' as It Launches 2 Missiles Into the Sea - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/International/korea-warns-merciless-strikes-launches-missiles-sea/story?id=29319874,"Tensions on the Korean Peninsula are on the rise, with North Korea warning of ""merciless"" war and launching two missiles as the joint United States-South Korean forces launched annual military drills on Monday.

The communist country test-fired two short-range ballistic missiles into the East Sea from Nampo, located 37 miles southwest of Pyongyang, North Korea, early Monday. Both flew about 310 miles, according to South Korea's Defense Ministry.

The test firings of missiles and rockets are often means of expressing dissatisfaction and are conducted regularly, especially during this time of the year. North Korea denounces the annual joint military exercises by U.S. and South Korean forces as rehearsals for a northern invasion aimed at toppling the country's regime.

“Key Resolve and Goal Eagle, which will last 'til April 24, are dangerous nuclear war drills for invading the DPRK,” an unidentified staff of the North Korean military said in a statement carried by the state Korea Central News Agency (KCNA).

North Korean leader Kim Jong-un called for his military to become elite guard units in full preparation for war with the United States, KCNA reported Saturday. Kim's statement was made as he inspected the new guard unit hall at a war museum. The title of guard is the highest given to elite units, and was created in 1950 during the Korean War.

Pyongyang offered last month to temporarily halt nuclear tests if the U.S. suspended those exercises with South Korea. Seoul and Washington have flatly rejected that proposal."

Yolie Ball, who lives with her husband, Don, in Davenport, Florida, says her phone has been ringing off the hook since Thursday night when her 15-year-old granddaughter, Makenzie Ball, called to tell her she was now a viral star.

“She called me last night at 7:30 and said, ‘Grandma, I’m going to tell you something,’” Ball told ABC News. “I did something and I don’t know if it’s going to be good or bad.”

What Makenzie, a high school student from Virginia, did was post photos on Twitter of her grandmother popping up in pictures taken by Ball’s daughter to be used to help sell the couple’s home.

Makenzie’s tweet, posted Wednesday, has now been retweeted over 14,000 times.

MY GRANDMA IS TRYING TO SELL HER HOUSE IN FLORIDA AND THESE ARE THE PICS I AM LAUGHING SO HARD pic.twitter.com/rONaIUyevS

“I thought the pictures of my grandma were hilarious and I wanted to share,” Makenzie told ABC News by email. “I didn't expect them to get so popular. I thought like 40 RTs from my friends MAX.”

The photos show Ball casually sipping coffee on the lanai, poking her head out of a bedroom, reading a magazine in the living room and leaning on a kitchen counter. They were taken by the Balls’ daughter, Sandra, when she visited them from the family’s native Massachusetts last month.

The couple is trying to sell their Florida home to move closer to their other daughter in Nashville, Tennessee, and took new photos of their home for a real estate guide.

“The first picture, the one where I have my head sticking out of the bedroom door, I was going to pull back and Sandra said, ‘No, mom, stay right there,’” Ball said. “It went from there.

“She’d say, ‘Oh, lean on the counter,’ or, ‘Go sit on the lanai,’” Ball recalled. “It was just a joke. We’re always doing silly stuff.”

Ball describes herself as a “dinosaur” when it comes to technology but she did know enough to know what her granddaughter meant by Twitter when she called.

Though the response has been “overwhelming” for the retiree and her husband, it is all in good fun for the tight-knit family that includes a son, Makenzie’s dad, in addition to their two daughters.

“We’re getting a kick out of it,” Ball said."

As of 6 p.m. Sunday, parts of Iowa had received up to 14 inches of snow. Across Chicago, more than 8 inches of snow had fallen at O'Hare International Airport and just to the west at Midway Airport, more than 9 inches of snow had fallen.

A blizzard warning remained in effect for the Chicago Metro Area until midnight local time for gusty winds blowing snow around and creating white-out conditions.

On Sunday afternoon, snow was falling simultaneously all the way from eastern Nebraska to central Pennsylvania, a distance of more than 1,100 miles, making the storm the most far-reaching of the season.

By Sunday evening, snow was still falling from Chicago to Detroit and light snow had begun to fall across eastern Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York. A wintry mix and areas of heavy rain extended further south from Indianapolis to the mid-Atlantic.

By the Monday morning commute, heavy snow is expected to be falling across much of the Northeast, with a dangerous icy mix further to the south that could affect cities from central Pennsylvania to northern New Jersey and New York City.

Temperatures will be milder to the south, so Philadelphia to Baltimore and Washington D.C. will see mostly rain.

Current forecasts from the ABC News Weather Team call for additional snowfall of 6-10 inches from Chicago to southern New England.

The highest amounts are expected from the eastern Great Lakes, including Detroit, eastward into central New England where a widespread 10-14 inches of snow will fall.

New York City can expect 2 to 5 inches of snow, Mayor Bill de Blasio said today, but added that ""a lot can change between now and the early morning hours.""

A winter storm watch will begin in the city at 7 p.m., he said.

The mayor said the biggest threats are ice and wind gusts.

""Keep your time outside limited tomorrow night,"" de Blasio said. ""Don't go outside if you don't need to.""

In addition to the heavy snow threat, dangerous icy conditions could cause travel problems from central Pennsylvania to Connecticut Monday morning. Major interstates, including routes 80 and 95, will likely be impacted first from heavy snow after midnight then an icy mix of sleet and freezing rain.

The storm was expected to begin to move out of the Northeast later on Monday morning, although some snow will likely still be falling across parts of New England into the evening."

A nurse who was in the train at the time told ABC News she started smelling something like ""burning rubber"" while they were stopped at Quincy station.

""The smell suddenly got worse when the conductor yelled, 'Everyone get off the train now!' Kristen Bellow, a nurse at Fisher College said. ""The conductor might have said there could be a fire, but I'm not sure because of everything that was going on.""

She said people became panicked and poured out of the train, but the doors of the car behind her never opened.

""A man on the platform yelled to break the windows and help get those people out,"" Bello told ABC News.

Bello said she and another man helped pull people out through a door.

""People were scrambling to get out,"" Bello added. ""They were scared, and I don't blame them. There was smoke all over the platform, and it must have been in the train. You could smell it very heavily and taste it.""

Train filled with smoke as an angry mob broke windows to get people out. You've outdone yourself @MBTA. #boston pic.twitter.com/wrAAo3BzEl

But there was never any smoke inside the train, according to Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority spokesman Joe Pesaturo.

""No train was filled with any smoke,"" Pesaturo told ABC News. ""There was no smoke whatsoever in the train. There was a mechanical problem, which resulted in a burst of small smoke outside of the train.""

There was a failure in the propulsion system, he said.

""There was never any danger,"" Pesaturo added. ""None one was injured. I don't know why the passengers acted the way they did. You can ask them.""

He said it was announced on the train that it would be taken out of service.

However, some people who claim to have been on the train are contradicting the MTBA's statement.

One user on social media who claims she was on the train said there definitely was smoke.

@MBTA trying 2 downplay. I was in the car, there was smoke, #mbta officials yelling ""Fire Get off the train!"" http://t.co/p4qH0qO9x0 #boston

The user also said that officials yelled, ""Fire! Get off the train!""

The incident comes just weeks after a Washington, D.C. subway filled with smoke and left one person dead."

On Sunday, Iraqi Prime Minister Al Abadi announced that the Iraqi military had launched a major operation to recapture the northern province of Saladin from ISIS. Tikrit is located 80 miles north of Baghdad and was seized by ISIS fighters last summer shortly after ISIS had taken over Mosul, Iraq’s second-largest city.

An Iraqi military spokesman told ABC News Monday that ISIS fighters were retreating from some areas in the province that had come under attack by Iraqi military forces. However, those claims could not be independently verified.

Iraqi state television reported that a large Iraqi military force had pushed into Saladin Province accompanied by Shiite and Sunni fighters and supported by Iraqi fighter jets. There have been unverified reports that the combined Iraqi force numbers as many as 30,000 Iraqi troops and militia fighters.

A U.S. official told ABC News that this appears to be more of a “tactical operation” and that Iraqi military elements involved do not appear to be well-coordinated.

""We were aware of the operation before it started,” Pentagon spokesman Col. Steve Warren told reporters Monday. “But I’m not going to details about what degree of coordination was involved in this.""

Another U.S. official said that the U.S. began monitoring Iraqi troop movements in the area last week, though it remains unclear how much advance information Iraq provided to American military officials.

Warren said U.S. and coalition aircraft are not providing airstrikes in support of the operation since Iraq did not request air support. A U.S. official told ABC News that the Iraqi Air Force and Army aviation are providing Iraqi troops with air cover for the operation.

Warren said the U.S. military mission in Iraq is to advise and assist Iraq's military in their fight against ISIS, but Iraq that decides the level of cooperation it wants.

A Shiite militia leader told the BBC that Iran's General Qasem Soleiman, the head of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard's Quds Force, was involved in the planning of the offensive. Officers of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards have been assisting the Iraqi military since last year and Iranian jets have conducted airstrikes against ISIS targets in eastern Iraq. Senior U.S. military officials have said repeatedly that there is no coordination with Iran in the fight against ISIS inside Iraq.

A U.S. official said Monday there appears to be Iranian involvement in the planning and execution of the Iraqi operation.

Warren noted that Iran has a great interest in the fight in Iraq, but he would not speak to the level of Iranian involvement.

Separately, Jordanian aircraft have now begun conducting airstrikes inside Iraq. Until now Jordan and four other Arab countries participating in the air campaign against ISIS had only launched airstrikes inside Syria. The expansion of Jordanian airstrikes into Iraq reflects Jordan's push to do more militarily against ISIS following the group's burning death of a captured Jordanian pilot last month."

The video, previously disclosed in court documents but only shown as a series of still images, showed Hernandez, now 25, and two associates returning to his North Attleboro, Massachusetts, house in the early morning hours of June 17, 2013 without Lloyd, prosecutors said. Other evidence showed Lloyd had been with them earlier, prosecutors alleged.

In the video, Hernandez is shown carrying what appears to be a gun.

“That, ladies and gentlemen, is a Glock,” Assistant District Attorney Patrick Bomberg told jurors.

Hernandez, had tampered with the cameras but investigators were able to retrieve photographs, prosecutors previously claimed. Those images, they said, were recovered from 14 surveillance cameras in Hernandez's $1.2 million home.

Hernandez has pleaded not guilty to murdering Lloyd. His attorney, Michael Fee, insisted during opening arguments today that his client lacked intent to murder, and added that Hernandez did not turn off or tamper with the footage from his home surveillance system.

""The evidence will show that if Aaron Hernandez wanted to destroy the recordings on that video system, he could have,"" Fee said. ""But he did not, because he had no reason to.""

But a statue hundreds of years old, recently analyzed in Europe, is a rarity: A full mummy of a meditating monk resides inside of it.

Researchers at the Netherlands' Meander Medical Center found the preserved body of a Buddhist master who likely died around the year 1100, believed to be named Liuquan, in a statue that had been exhibited last year at the Drents Museum in Netherlands.

Scientists had known the statue contained a mummy, but even so, the CT scans of the statue reveal unprecedented information about an extreme form of meditation.

Its display at the Drents Museum marked the first time the statue had been outside of China, reported Discover Magazine, and following the close of the exhibit the statue was taken to the Meander Medical Center in Amersfoort, Netherlands for CT scans.

The practice might sound like a grim effort to take one's life, but that wasn't its intent: Self-mummification was only for the most devoted of religious monks, and the practice was seen as a path to enlightenment or an advanced spiritual state.

The imaging confirmed the existence of Liquan's mummy. The monk, believed to be a member of the Chinese Meditation School, may have practiced self-mummification, considered by certain Buddhists to be the highest form of religious enlightenment.


The process involved first a rigorous, year-long diet of water nuts, berries and other similar foods, abstaining completely from grains and more substantial food, reports  c|net. Afterward, the monk would likely be fed a tea made from a toxic lacquer tree, given a tube used for food and air, and a bell to indicate that the monk was still alive.


When the bell stopped ringing, the monk would be sealed in a tomb for three more years, and when reopened, a deceased monk found intact would be said to have reached true enlightenment; those who decomposed would have been considered to fall short of their goal, though their attempts were still honored. Some successful ""living Buddhas"" would have shrines built in their honor, according to a study of the practice by iO9.

This particular monk's organs have been removed and replaced with scrolls of paper inscribed with ancient Chinese characters; the Drents Museum considers it an example of self-mummification, and more research is needed into the existence of the scrolls and their meaning.

The statue will be on display at the Hungarian Natural History Museum until May 2015."

Within an hour, strangers showed up to save the day.

Glenn Buratti invited all 16 of his kindergarten classmates from a Florida elementary school to his sixth birthday party last weekend. His mother, Ashlee Buratti, said not a single one responded to the invite.

“He was so devastated when he realized no one was coming to his birthday party that he refused to smile,” Buratti told ABC News today. “He tried to hide the fact that he was crying by pinching the bridge of his nose.”

""I know this might be something silly to rant about, but my heart is breaking for my son,"" Ashlee wrote to the Facebook group “Osceola Rants, Raves and Reviews List”, which has more than 10,000 members. ""He keeps asking 'when will my friends get here?'”

The post quickly went viral. And then the guests arrived.

First it was the owner of a local pet shop and her family, Buratti said. They brought a gift for her son and stayed for hotdogs and cake. Soon half a dozen families stopped by to help the little boy celebrate his big day. As the house filled up, her son’s smile grew bigger, she said.

Someone from the Osceola County Sheriff's Department also saw the post. They sent a helicopter to join in the celebration. For twenty minutes it flew over their house, circling and swooping low again and again to make sure everyone knew it was for her son, Buratti said.

Later in the week, the department sent over police cars, fire trucks, a SWAT van and a canine unit.

“At first he was scared and got a little upset but when I explained it was all for him, he just loved it,” Buratti said.

Buratti said her son, who is mildly autistic and also has epilepsy, sometimes experiences social anxiety and has difficulty managing his behavior when in a group.

“It can be tough for kids with autism to make friends,” said Wendy Fournier, president of National Autism Association. “They can have trouble making eye contact and communicating and there is sometimes a processing delay so their conversations don‘t always flow.”

Though not a single parent has yet to offer an apology or explanation for the no-shows, Buratti said she is not upset with anyone. But she hopes people keep in mind what it takes to put together a birthday party and what it means for a child to have someone attend.

“When you are thinking about something as simple as a birthday party, think about the child who is sitting there waiting for his friends to show up,” she said."

The 51-year-old astronaut has signed on to live in the International Space Station for a full year on Friday. The goal of the mission is to find out how the human body responds to a prolonged stay in space. No American astronaut has spent more than six months beyond Earth’s atmosphere, and the full extent of the physical and psychological strains of space exploration are still unknown.

“There are risks and I am willing to accept that for what we are going to learn from it,” Kelly told ABC’s David Kerley.

Scott Kelly’s twin brother, Mark, who is also an astronaut, will be remain on Earth as an experimental control to help measure the changes to Scott’s body while in space.

“We need to figure out how people are going to live in space for really long periods of time, especially if we want to send somebody to Mars [and]… build a base on the Moon,” Mark Kelly said.

It takes 18 months roundtrip to get to Mars, and the data from Kelly’s expedition will help NASA determine whether a human can survive that journey. Scott Kelly recognizes the risks of the unprecedented expedition, but says he’s focused on doing what it takes to advance space travel and exploration.

“That's one of the things that makes it exciting and something I am really happy to be a part of,” he said."
1Dmf0v2,2015-03-02 00:00:00,'We Call It Life Row': Two of the Youngest US Women on Death Row Describe Life Behind Bars - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/US/call-life-row-youngest-us-women-death-row/story?id=29165934,"When Tiffany Cole and Emilia Carr walk down the hall in Florida’s Lowell Correctional Institution for Women together, they seem more like smiling girlfriends than convicted felons sitting on death row.

Cole is now 33, and Carr is now 30. Carr is the youngest woman in the United States sitting on death row, and Cole is the third youngest. The two women are behind bars for committing two separate crimes, and they had separate lives until they arrived as neighbors on the famous death row corridor at the women’s correctional facility in Ocala, Florida.

“We call it ‘life row,’” Carr said. “It’s life row ... because we’re not dying, we’re living.”

Carr, who is from Ocala, and Cole, from Jacksonville, Florida, share a similar path.

Prior to their incarcerations, neither had ever spent a night in jail, they said. Cole played the flute in high school, and participated in cheerleading and Girl Scouts. Carr was book smart and modeled, she said, and was in the school Marines, which was her high school's Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) program.

Both said they were sexually abused and got into trouble after they met the “wrong people.”

“[I was] looking for love in all the wrong places,” Cole said.

When she was 25 years old, Cole was convicted on murder charges after being connected to the death of her family’s neighbors, Reggie and Carol Sumner, who suffocated to death from dirt in their lungs when they were buried alive. She has acknowledged she helped dig a grave, but said she thought it would be to hide the items that she, her boyfriend, a guy she had known for three weeks and two of his friends had stolen from their victims. A psychiatrist at Cole’s trial said she suffered from mental problems and had a history of drug and alcohol abuse.

“I am not the same person anymore,” Cole said. “I have peace, I have joy. I have a sound mind.”

The jury was shown a damning photo of her celebrating after the crime was committed. She was given the death penalty, which she is in the process of appealing.

Carr was 26 years old and eight months pregnant with her boyfriend’s child when they were both convicted of suffocating his wife with duct tape and a plastic bag. Carr argued she left the scene before the woman was killed.

“Wouldn’t there have been physical evidence? I mean, duct tape is some sticky stuff, yet there’s no finger prints, no DNA, no hair,” Carr said.

But there is video of Carr being interviewing by police, recorded after her boyfriend confessed and implicated her in the crime. On the tape, Carr is heard telling an officer that the boyfriend asked her to “try to snap her neck,” and then Carr says, “I didn’t really try.”

She was convicted of capital murder and given the death penalty, which she is in the process of appealing.

Legal experts say the average appeals process takes 10 to 12 years for death row inmates. Carr has been on death row for four years, while Cole has been on death row for seven years.

Both women are reluctant to give details about their cases under appeal, but both insist the murders they were convicted of were done at the hand of their boyfriends, not them. Both say they are not arguing for their release, just for their lives, to have their executions stayed.

Both refuse to believe they will be executed.

“You can’t have that mentality, because that means you've accepted this,” Carr said.

“You've already died... you’re already dead,” if you accept that, Cole said.

In response to Cole appealing her conviction, the prosecutor who handled her case, Jay Plotkin, said in a statement to ABC News, “I was a prosecutor for more than 20 years. There was not any case that I prosecuted where the crime was more vile or cruel than the torture and murder of the Sumners. This case lingers on in the heart and soul of our community. Ms. Cole is certainly entitled to, and should, exhaust all of her legal rights to appeal. I am personally confident that she received more than adequate representation and a fair trial.”

The prosecutor in Carr’s case, Rock Hooker, declined to comment to ABC News while the appeals process was still pending.

According to the National Academy of Sciences, one in 25 people on death row is innocent."

The countdown at Cape Canaveral, Florida, was halted two-and-a-half minutes before the schedulled launch, because of a problem with a rocket-tracking system.

The climate satellite is a joint project of NASA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the U.S. Air Force that SpaceX, a private company, is contracted to launch into space.

The 22-story Falcon rocket carrying the satellite is now scheduled to blast off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida Monday shortly after sunset.

Shortly after liftoff, the rocket is set to detach from the payload and begin a controlled descent to Earth, with the goal of executing a pinpoint landing onto a drone ship in the Atlantic. It will be the second rocket recycling attempt for SpaceX, coming one month after it came close to pulling off the historic feat.

After launching its Dragon capsule to the International Space Station, founder Elon Musk and his team watched as the rocket booster came hurtling toward the bull's-eye target on the barge.

The rocket came close, but landed hard at a 45-degree angle, smashing its legs and engine section, making for a spectacular and fiery landing.

Musk is intent on making the rocket recycling test work and has said he believes it will ""revolutionize access to space.""

""If one can figure out how to effectively reuse rockets just like airplanes, the cost of access to space will be reduced by as much as a factor of a hundred,"" he has said."

Now, a new 3-D map of one of the most well-known supernovas, Cassiopeia A, reveals a bubbly interior, which could shed new light on the spectacular way these stars die, according to research published today in the journal ""Science.""

Rather than having uniform layers of ejected material, the new 3-D map found the supernova remnant has frothy cavities that were possibly created by radioactive nickel during the explosion that decays to form iron. In a star that is massive enough, the star explodes in a supernova when it runs out of nuclear fuel, combining lighter elements through fusion reactions until it reaches iron, at which point the star's inner core collapses. Elements heavier than iron are thought to be formed during the explosion.

A supernova is so violent and bright that many can be observed with the naked eye and are a common occurrence in our universe. Having exploded some 340 years ago, Cassiopeia A is relatively young and close to Earth, making it an ideal case study, researchers said.

""We’re sort of like bomb squad investigators. We examine the debris to learn what blew up and how it blew up,"" Dan Milisavljevic of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics told Smithsonian Science. ""Our study represents a major step forward in our understanding of how stars actually explode.""

Moving forward, scientists hope technological advances in telescopes will allow them to better study the bubbly interior -- including the presence of iron."

ABC News has confirmed that the juror in question, whom ABC News has decided not to identify, was a victim of statutory rape 15 years ago, and his or her attacker was sentenced to 12 months in jail and 60 months of probation for the crime, but the juror never revealed that information during the jury selection process.

In a statement to ABC News, the attorney for the juror said that the ""past situation has zero similarity to the facts presented within the Vanderbilt trial... nor did the past situation have any impact upon deliberations or decision-making in this case.""

Vandenburg's defense said it now plans to file a motion to have the verdict vacated, which, if granted, means the judge could declare a mistrial, and the guilty verdict could be overturned.

On Tuesday, the jury took just three hours to decide Vandenburg and another former Vanderbilt football player, Cory Batey, were each guilty of four counts of aggravated rape, one count of attempted aggravated rape and two counts of aggravated sexual battery. Vandenburg was also found guilty of tampering with evidence and unlawful photography after prosecutors claimed he recorded the sexual assault on his phone, shared it with friends and then tried to cover it up.

Vandenburg and Batey are scheduled to be sentenced on March 6.

The graphic sexual assault case played out in a Nashville courtroom over 12 days, as prosecutors presented surveillance video they said showed Vandenburg carrying the victim into his dorm, accompanied by Batey and two other former players, Brandon Banks and Jaborian McKenzie. Jurors also had to watch cell phone video that prosecutors claimed Vandenburg recorded as the sexual assault went on in his dorm room in 2013.

Prosecutors said the victim, a 21-year-old former neuroscience major and dance team member at the university, was drunk and passed out when the incident occurred.

Three jurors from the trial, who spoke to ABC News' ""20/20"" the day after the verdict was announced, said the evidence that played the biggest role in deciding their guilty verdict was the videos that prosecutors claimed proved the four former Vanderbilt football players sexually assaulted the victim.

""As soon as we saw the videos and photographic evidence ... we knew exactly who was guilty of what and what we were going to come back with,"" said juror Todd Easter. ""What we knew is that a terrible crime had occurred.""

Juror Dr. Corbi Milligan told ""20/20"" that she was ""horrified and utterly disgusted"" when she watched the footage.

""I do hold [Vandenburg] criminally responsible for what occurred to [the victim] in that room,"" Milligan said. ""It was horrific. ... She was horribly victimized, and as difficult as it was for us to have to render that verdict, it was justice, and it had to be done.""

Another juror, Dr. Deirde Young, said the footage made her feel ""awful.""

""I asked myself, 'how could they do this to that young lady?'"" Young added. ""There can't be enough explanation to me. I don't know, I think they need to do some real soul searching. I've never experienced anything like these young men."""

American Troy Bradley and Russian Leonid Tiukhtyaev passed the final milestone on their checklist of world records that had originally been set by Double Eagle II on its transatlantic flight in 1978.

Jeremy, who became a global sensation after images of his treatment circulated online, was released Wednesday night, according to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.

The koala was rehabilitated by the Australian Marine Wildlife Research & Rescue Organisation (AMWRRO) after being rescued by a local firefighter.

""Jeremy [is] now released and loving life once again,"" the AMRRO said on Facebook. ""Special thanks to everyone involved ... and to the thousands of people who have sent sell wishes, support and strength his way.""

The koala was the first of dozens sent to AMWRRO Wildlife Clinic after fires swept the Sampson Flat locality in South Australia, where it's the summer season.

He was was treated for second-degree partial thickness burns, the AMRRO said on Facebook.

Jeremy was originally a grumpy fellow, nervous around the caretakers, the president of AMWRRO told BBC News.

""He had a big attitude,"" president Aaron Macado said, adding that Jeremy became easier to handle once he realized his caretakers weren't going to eat him.

During his recovery, there was a misunderstanding that koalas under AMWRRO's care needed mittens, though this wasn't true, according to the group's website.

""[T]hey simply impede the animal’s ability to self-feed, hang onto branches or climb limbs that are in their cages,"" AMWRRO wrote on the site.

The organization shared the video below of Jeremy using his claws to eat to further clarify why he didn't need mittens.

There are still at least a dozen koalas being treated, Yahoo! 7 News reported.

A kangaroo named Gabby, who was also under AMWRRO's care after a fire, wasn't as lucky as Jeremy. She was euthanized after developing a painful, incurable muscular disease, the AMRRO said on Facebook.

AMWRRO did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for additional comment."
1DNYRyL,2015-03-03 00:00:00,Ways to Stop Drinking Soda for Good - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Health/ways-stop-drinking-soda-good/story?id=29338974,"You know soda's not exactly good for you—but at the same time, it can be hard to resist. Its sweet taste, pleasant fizz, and energizing jolt often seems like just what you need to wash down your dinner, get you through an afternoon slump, or quench your thirst at the movies.

But the more soda you consume (regular or diet), the more hazardous your habit can become. And whether you're a six-pack-a-day drinker or an occasional soft-drink sipper, cutting back can likely have benefits for your weight and your overall health. Here's why you should be drinking less, plus tips on how to make the transition easier.

27 Mistakes Healthy People Make

The biggest risk for regular soda drinkers is the excess calories, says Lona Sandon, RD, assistant professor of clinical nutrition at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. ""The calories in regular soda are coming entirely from added sugar, and you're not getting any value in terms of vitamins or minerals, or even good quality carbohydrates,"" she says.

But soda may also be causing other types of harm. Studies have shown that its consumption is linked with tooth decay and diabetes, and it also seems to be bad for your bones. ""It may have something to do with the phosphorus in soda, or it could be that people are drinking soda instead of other beverages—like milk—that have nutrients necessary for healthy bones,"" Sandon says.

But what about diet soda? Sugar-free sodas may not have any calories, but that doesn't mean they're any good for you. In fact, they may not even help you lose weight. (Research on this topic has been mixed, at best, but several studies have shown that diet soda drinkers are more likely to be overweight or obese than regular soda drinkers.)

Plus, diet drinks have many of the same health risks as regular soft drinks, including tooth decay and bone thinning, and they've also been linked to heart disease and depression in women. Switching to diet sodas may be a smart first step if you're trying to eliminate excess calories, says Sandon, but your best bet is to eventually give them up, too.

10 Reasons to Give Up Diet Soda

That news may be enough to convince you that you should stop drinking soda, but it could still be easier said than done. ""People really can become addicted to soda, so you have to be a realist and not an idealist,"" says nutritionist Stefanie Sacks, author of the forthcoming book What the Fork Are You Eating?. ""I don't recommend going cold turkey; you need to wean yourself off, just like you would anything you've become dependent on.""

If you typically drink multiple servings of soda a day, Sacks suggests first cutting back to one a day. Give that two weeks, then switch to three sodas a week. ""It gives you a chance to adjust gradually, which should lead to real, sustainable change,"" says Sacks.

Sandon also recommends weaning yourself slowly off soda, and sometimes suggests that her clients start drinking half-soda, half-water. ""You're automatically drinking less and hydrating and filling up with water, which is a good thing,"" she says.

But there's an added advantage, as well: ""It cuts back on the sweetness you get from soda, which is one of the things people get really used to. If you're drinking less sugar, your taste buds will change and soon you won't need that sweetness anymore.""

12 Strange-But-True Health Tricks

If you're blindly throwing back colas without stopping to think of their impact on your waistline, you could be in for a rude awakening: Each 12-ounce can of Coke, for example, contains 140 calories, while a 20-ounce bottle has 240.

Downloading a calorie-tracking app may help you realize just how much those beverages can affect your daily calorie consumption—as long as you actually log in and record each serving. Instead of pouring yourself refill after refill, start paying attention to how much you're actually drinking; once you do, you may be more willing to cut back.

Another way to quantify the calories you're drinking is by thinking about how much exercise it would take to burn them off. In a 2014 Johns Hopkins University study, researchers placed signs in corner stores stating that a 20-ounce bottle of soda would take 5 miles of walking or 50 minutes of jogging to burn off.

These ""advertisements"" worked: When teenager customers saw these signs, they were more likely to buy a smaller soda, a water, or no drink at all. ""When you explain calories in an easily understandable way such as how many miles of walking needed to burn them off, you can encourage behavior change,” said the study authors.

Need that jolt of caffeine to wake up in the morning? If you're not a coffee drinker, Sandon suggests sipping on unsweetened iced tea instead. ""It can be just as refreshing, and there are real health benefits to drinking the phytochemicals in tea,"" she says.

If you don't like the taste of plain tea, mix in some lemon, mint, or a small amount of sugar or artificial sweetener—at least during your transition-from-soda phase. The important thing is that you're aware of, and in charge of, exactly what's going into your drink and how much is added.

Whenever the urge to drink a soda hits, fill up a big glass of ice water and finish that first. ""A lot of times, people drink soda just because they're bored, or they're thirsty, and that's what's available or that's what they're used to,"" says Sacks.

If you're still craving a soda after you've downed your H2O, then you can reconsider whether it's really worth it—but chances are your thirst will be quenched and you'll feel satisfied from just the water. (You can make this work while you're out and about, too, by always carrying a bottle of water with you.)

7 Easy Ways to Drink More Water

When Sacks has successfully weaned her clients down to just a few sodas a week, she often recommends they switch to a brand with fewer artificial ingredients. ""They're more expensive, but you'll be drinking them less often,"" she says. Sacks likes Grown Up Soda, Santa Cruz Organics, and Blue Sky because they don't contain high-fructose corn syrup or artificial ingredients, and generally contain less sugar than the big brands. ""They're an overall healthier choice, especially if you're only drinking them occasionally.""

If it's carbonation you crave, try drinking plain or flavored seltzer water, suggests Sacks. You can buy seltzer by the bottle, or make your own at home with a SodaStream machine ($69, amazon.com).

""Toss a little fruit juice in there for flavor, and eventually change that juice to fresh-squeezed citrus,"" says Sacks. ""That way you still get the bubbles that you love in soda, but you're in control of how much sweetness and sugar is added.""

Even still water (or non-bubbly) can be made more palatable with the addition of some fruit or natural flavors. ""People tell me they don't like water, but often they just need to experiment with new ways to drink it,"" says Sandon.

She recommends adding lemon, orange, or cucumber slices to a pitcher of water in your refrigerator, which can serve as a detour when you go hunting for a cold soda.Frozen berries and fresh mint can also be tasty additions to a cold glass of H2O.

If you drink a lot of soda and you're not quite ready to give it up, try buying caffeine-free versions instead. You may start drinking less without even realizing it, suggests a 2015 study published in the British Journal of Nutrition. In the study, participants were split into two groups and all told to drink as much soda as they'd like for the next 28 days. (One group got regular, one group got caffeine-free.) Even though there was no noticeable taste difference between the two, the caffeinated group drank 53% more over the next month—about 5 ounces a day. When our bodies get used to regular caffeine, we crave more of it, say the study authors, prompting us to drink more.

You may notice that you only drink soda in certain places or situations: In the afternoon at the office, for example, or when you eat at a certain restaurant. You may not be able to completely avoid these scenarios—you've still got to go to work and should still enjoy eating out—but you may be able to change those bad habits.

If it's the office vending machine that tempts you to buy a soda every day, try to stay away from it in the afternoon—and pack your own healthy beverage or a refillable water bottle so you have an alternative. Or if you tend to crave soda with a certain type of food, try restaurants that offer other options instead.

Weaning yourself off something gradually works best for most people, says Sacks, but some may want to try the cold turkey approach. If you plan to go that route, think of it as a temporary change: Giving soda up for two weeks or a month may be easier and more manageable than ditching it forever.

The best part about this trick? Once your time is up, you may not even want to go back to soda—at least not at the frequency you drank it before. ""We acquire a taste for sugar depending on how much we have on a daily basis,"" says Sandon. ""If you cut out soda for a while, you may be surprised at how sweet it tastes ones you go back."" (Want extra help with the cold-turkey method? Enlist friends to take the challenge with you.)

Once you're able to break your regular soda habit and the drink loses its grip on you, it can be treated just like any other junk food: If you really love the taste, there's nothing wrong with an occasional indulgence, says Sacks. ""If it's your gotta-have-it food, then by all means splurge on a soda now and then,"" she says. In fact, knowing that you can have a soda on your cheat day or during a special night out may help you resist them on a more regular basis. ""Just do it from a place of education: If you understand that soda is essentially just sugar and artificial flavorings, then you can be more smart about when or if you're going to drink it.""

The driver was identified as Jose Alejandro Sanchez Ramirez, who had a valid commercial drivers license from Arizona, Oxnard Police Department Assistant Police Chief Jason Benites said.

Ramirez fled the scene but was found uninjured 1.6 miles away, and was not in the truck at time of collision, Benites said.

Police initially said the driver was arrested, but Benites said later he had been stopped but was not under arrest. This evening, however, Benites announced the arrest and charge.

Ramirez, 54, was driving a produce truck when he turned right onto the tracks, eventually getting stuck there, Benites said. Minutes after the crash, Benites added, an officer found the driver and said he looked disoriented.

The driver was taken to a hospital for observation.

Others injuries included people with head trauma and neck and back injuries who were taken to a hospital. Police said at least four people were critically injured, including the engineer. The conductor and another crew member were injured, treated and released from the hospital, officials said.

Metro-North Tragedy: How the Most Fatal Train Crash in Its History Unfolded

Reality Star's Mysterious Burbank Train Death

Nine patients, including three in critical condition, were taken to Ventura County Medical Center.

Dr. Bryan Wong, the medical director at the Ventura County Medical Center, told ABC News station KABC-TV in Los Angeles tone patient told him the impact was so violent and sudden they had no chance to brace themselves.

""He felt a violent jerking motion, couldn't grab on seat,"" Wong said. ""He was thrown against side of the train at that point.""

Another passenger, Joel Bingham, told KABC he was also thrown during the violent crash.

""I grabbed on to the pole and was flipping on the pole,"" Bingham told KABC. ""The lights went out. It seemed like slow motion. It seemed like it took forever.""

In addition to the 28 injured, another 23 passengers were on board who did not report being injured.

""We did what we could and we're lucky we survived,"" passenger Guy Basile told KABC.

Basile was not injured in the crash.

There have been no fatalities in the crash in which five train cars derailed and three were left on their side, according to Oxnard police. The train was heading toward downtown Los Angeles when it crashed.

Before hitting the truck, the train operator spotted the truck and applied the brakes, according to police. The train was traveling along 2 miles of flat railroad track so the truck was more easily visible.

The National Transportation Safety Board announced it will lead an investigation into the collision. At a news conference, NTSB board member Robert Sumwalt told reporters they are concerned about such collisions between trains and cars.

""Over 2,000 grade-crossing accidents every year, and there are about 250 fatalities, so this is something the NTSB is concerned about,"" Sumwalt told ABC when asked whether rail-crossing accidents are a widespread problem.

An NTSB spokesman confirmed they were sending investigators to the scene as well.

""This morning's accident on Metrolink's Ventura County Line is a tragedy and our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families,"" a spokesman for the Federal Railroad Administration said. ""Federal Railroad Administration investigators are en route to the scene, and they will conduct a thorough investigation to determine the factors that contributed to this accident. Safety must be every railroad's absolute top priority and we will establish what lapses, if any, occurred and order any necessary corrective actions.""

Oxnard is about 65 miles northwest of Los Angeles.

Deborah Hersman, the president of the National Safety Council and the former chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, said this type of railroad at-grade crossing has been the site of other train and vehicle collisions across the United States.

""I think we see way too many of these grade cross crashes across the U.S.,"" Hersman said. ""[We've] got to pay attention to this issue to prevent future fatalities and injuries.""

1DoOAZQ,2015-02-24 00:00:00,Trayvon Martin: DOJ Announces No Charges Against George Zimmerman - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/US/trayvon-martin-doj-announces-charges-george-zimmerman/story?id=29186648,"While the public waits for a Justice Department announcement over two separate investigations spurred by the summer shooting of an unarmed teenager in Ferguson, Missouri, the department announced today it is closing its investigation into the killing of Trayvon Martin.

Justice Department officials met with Martin's family today, and were told that they will not be filing charges against George Zimmerman, who shot the 17-year-old after a confrontation in 2012. Thursday marks three years to the day since Martin was killed.

Federal prosecutors concluded there is not sufficient evidence to prove Zimmerman, a neighborhood watchman in Sanford, Fla., intentionally violated Martin's civil rights.

""Although the department has determined that this matter cannot be prosecuted federally, it is important to remember that this incident resulted in the tragic loss of a teenager's life,"" Acting Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta of the Civil Rights Division said. ""Our decision not to pursue federal charges does not condone the shooting that resulted in the death of Trayvon Martin and is based solely on the high legal standard applicable to these cases.""
The case sparked intense discussions over race in America because Martin was walking to his home with only Skittles and an iced tea in his hands.

Florida prosecutors tried to convict Zimmerman of state-level murder and manslaughter charges, but in July 2013 a jury acquitted him, saying prosecutors didn't have enough evidence to prove their case.

One juror -– the only minority on the all-female jury –- later told ABC News that ""as the law was read to me, if you have no proof that he killed him intentionally, you can't say he's guilty.""

""You can't put the man in jail even though in our hearts we felt he was guilty,"" she said. ""But we had to grab our hearts and put it aside and look at the evidence.""

In Sanford, race-related tensions had been simmering for nearly a century, but Martin's death ""was the proverbial 'straw that broke the camel's back,'"" bringing ""those issues to the surface,"" the new Sanford police chief, Cecil Smith, recently told federal officials.

After Martin was killed, Holder sat down his own teenage son to explain that -- as unfair as it may be -- young black men must often interact with police in a different way than others, he told a convention in April 2014. It was ""a conversation I hoped I'd never have to have,"" Holder added.

As media attention mounted over Martin's death, protests grew across the country calling for justice. The city of Sanford now says a police department had not been scrutinized like that by the press, religious organizations, social activists and the broader public since Los Angeles police beat Rodney King in 1991.

Zimmerman was not a police officer and the neighborhood watch program he was a part of was independent from local police.

Many accused Zimmerman of discriminating against Martin –- essentially taking action against the teenager and ultimately killing him because Martin was black. Zimmerman is Hispanic.

The Justice Department's Civil Rights Division and FBI opened an investigation into the case, noting ""experienced federal prosecutors"" would determine ""whether the evidence reveals a prosecutable violation"" of federal law. In a statement, the department noted there are ""limited federal criminal civil rights statutes within our jurisdiction.""

Privately and publicly, Justice Department officials have been telegraphing all along that they were unlikely to file charges against Zimmerman. And in November 2013, Holder said the case against Zimmerman ""in substantial part was resolved"" with his acquittal months earlier.

Nevertheless, federal officials have insisted their civil-rights probe would be thorough and complete. Several months ago –- nearly two years into the Justice Department's investigation –- Holder said federal investigators were still seeking to interview certain witnesses ""as a result of some recent developments.""

More recently, Holder has said he hoped to announce the findings of the Zimmerman and Ferguson-related probes before he leaves office, which could happen in a matter of weeks, depending on when the U.S. Senate confirms his successor.

Holder has said then when a decision is announced in the Zimmerman case, it will be accompanied by ""as much information"" as possible detailing the Justice Department's findings.

In the Ferguson case, the department is currently conducting two probes into the matter.

A criminal investigation will try to determine whether then-officer Darren Wilson used unreasonable force and intentionally violated Michael Brown's civil rights when he shot the unarmed teenager in August. The second probe - though not criminal in nature –- will look more broadly into whether the Ferguson police department has routinely engaged in a ""pattern or practice"" of unlawful and discriminatory policing.

A state grand jury in Ferguson, Missouri, declined to indict Wilson in Novembe4 2014. Many expect the Justice Department will not be able to bring federal charges against Wilson, but will take action against the local police department.

1DOoks0,2015-03-02 00:00:00,Officials: Mom Knew Her Son Mohammed Emwazi Was 'Jihadi John' - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/International/officials-mom-knew-son-jihadi-john/story?id=29321335,"The mother of the man identified as ""Jihadi John"" recognized immediately from his voice that her son was the alleged killer when he appeared in his first beheading video in August, Kuwaiti government officials told ABC News.

The father of Mohammed Emwazi, who was questioned recently in Kuwait, told authorities the family last heard from his son in mid-2013 when the younger Emwazi called them from Turkey. Emwazi said he was going to do humanitarian work in Syria, the father said, according to the officials. Emwazi's father, a former policeman, said he's been waiting for news of his son's death ever since.

Instead of doing humanitarian work, Emwazi allegedly linked up with ISIS and has appeared in videos online apparently beheading Westerners, including several who were actual humanitarians. Late Tuesday, a British newspaper reported Emwazi's father had denied the Kuwaiti officials' claims that his wife recognized their son's voice in the videos.

Ever since, a complex picture is emerging of the alleged murderer's life before ISIS. Born in Kuwait, Emwazi moved with his family to London when he was a boy.

A school picture captured what appeared to be an angelic smile, but a teacher told the BBC Emwazi had anger management issues, for which he eventually went to therapy.

A former boss of Emwazi's in Kuwait, when Emwazi briefly lived there in 2010, told The Guardian that Emwazi was a stellar employee, ""calm and decent.""

""He was the best employee we ever had,"" the former boss said of the then 21-year-old.

Even later, a member of the British activist group CAGE told reporters he saw Emwazi as a ""beautiful young man.""

But at the same time, Emwazi was linked by court documents to a number of alleged jihadists in London who purportedly supported a terror group in Somalia.

In recent years Emwazi had attempted to move back to Kuwait to pursue a computer science job there but was denied entry, according to an official with CAGE, with whom he corresponded. Instead, Emwazi is alleged to have eventually gone to join ISIS.

Now, a former ISIS fighter says Emwazi is being used by the terror group.

""ISIS play him like a piano, a celebrity to attract our Muslim brothers in Europe,"" the fighter told the BBC. ""But some think he is showing off, they think he is being used by ISIS.""

The fighter described Emwazi as cold and ""strange"" when the two met in Syria.

Still, Emwazi is a high-value target for American and coalition airstrikes. But authorities told ABC News he has been careful to avoid using computers or his cell phone, which could give away his location.

[Editor's Note: This report has been updated to reflect that officials were referencing Emwazi's father's statements to them. It is unclear if his mother was interviewed as well."
1DOYXHB,2015-02-13 00:00:00,Brother Says He's Humbled By Obama's Remarks About Sisters Slain Near UNC - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/US/brother-humbled-obamas-remarks-sisters-slain-unc/story?id=28958980,"The brother of two sisters killed near the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill said his family is ""proud to be American.""

Yosur Mohammad, 21, her husband Deah Barakat and her sister Razan Mohammad Abu-Salha, were shot and killed on Tuesday, allegedly by neighbor Craig Stephen Hicks.

Hicks is accused of first-degree murder in the three deaths.

Yousef Abu-Salha, brother of the slain sisters, told ABC News he was humbled that President Barack Obama spoke out against the murders today, saying no one in America should be targeted ""because of who they are, what they look like or how they worship.""

Obama also quoted Yosur Mohammad, who said in a past interview that she felt growing up in America was ""a blessing.""

""She’s completely right and that’s why we live here and that’s why we’re so proud to be Americans and chase the American Dream,"" Abu-Salha said of his sister.

Abu-Salha said his sisters had always been able to fit in with those around them while growing up in America.

""She meshed very well in this culture,"" Abu-Salha said of Yosur Mohammad. ""I believe my sister really showed us in a positive light all over the world which is really needed at this time.""

Barakat was born in the U.S. and his family was from Syria. The sisters were of Jordanian descent.

Abu-Salha said he and his family were thankful for the outpouring of support, which has helped the devastated family, based in Raleigh, North Carolina.

""I think it's going to be a long process,"" Abu-Salha said of the recovery period. ""It’s very heartwarming the support we’ve gotten all over the world. It’s been holding us up the prayers, vigils, the marches everywhere.""

Abu-Salha said his family expected to receive a call from Obama later tonight.

Hicks remains in jail on charges of first-degree murder. He has not yet entered a plea. Police said their preliminary investigation indicated the murder stemmed from a parking dispute, but they would also investigate if the killings could be considered a hate crime. The FBI has opened a parallel investigation to see if any federal laws were violated.

The New England Patriots rookie cornerback, 24, hadn’t been drafted out of West Alabama -- and beyond the Patriots, no other team expressed interest in signing him. But the Vicksburg, Mississippi, native had a hunch. Someone offered him affirmation on Twitter. A coach wrote him before the game.

“When I really believed it is, when I called an Uber driver for my mom, my mom called me and told me, ‘The guy spoke nice of you and he said he felt like you’re going to do something fantastic tomorrow.’ I just prayed on it and I just went out and played as hard as I could, and it turned out great,” Butler told ABC News.

Butler's interception came with the Seattle Seahawks one yard away from scoring the go-ahead touchdown. Seahawks receiver Ricardo Lockette cut across the middle. Quarterback Russell Wilson threw the ball.

Butler had faced the play in practice in the days leading up to the Super Bowl. In practice, Butler got beat for a touchdown.

He wasn’t about to let history repeat itself.

“I got beat on the route in practice and the memorization and the preparation just helped me out, and I just jumped the route and made a play,” Butler told ABC News. “It was do-or-die time so I just had to do it.”

Butler is especially proud of the obstacles he’s overcome. He said his mother worked two jobs during his childhood to make ends meet for him and his siblings.

“You see some tough things growing up, and I just always said, ‘I didn’t want to have that life,'"" he said. ""I wanted to be someone. And I just wanted to make my family a better family and inspire young kids that anyone, that you can do whatever you wanted to do if you put your mind to it and you just believe and have faith.”"

The council approved the $2 billion plan with a 5-0 vote after a meeting with several hours of public comment and many vocal Rams fans wearing jerseys in attendance.

Construction on the project should begin “rapidly,” Inglewood Mayor James Butts Jr. told ABC News in an interview following the vote. The developer has agreed to pay for the entire project, including public improvements such as roads and fire hydrants near the stadium, Butts said.

“One hundred percent of the risk of the project is borne by the developer, 100 percent,” Butts said. “There is no scenario where the city can be out one dime.”

The vote adopts a new redevelopment plan without calling a public vote, effectively jump-starting construction and sidestepping lengthy environmental reviews of issues such as noise, traffic and air pollution.

It adds the 80,000 seat, 60-acre stadium to an existing 2009 plan to redevelop the former Hollywood Park racetrack site with homes, offices, stores, parks and open space and a hotel.

Kroenke is part of the Hollywood Park Land Co. development group that is promoting the project. But a plan is also in the works in St. Louis in hopes of keeping the team with a 64,000-seat stadium on the city's north riverfront.

While the deal does not include upfront tax money, the development group expects to recoup up to $100 million in local tax dollars in the first five years of operation, which would help defray some of the costs of improvements.

As the St. Louis Rams consider a move, the San Diego Chargers and Oakland Raiders are collaborating on a proposal to build a privately financed stadium in Carson, California, that the two teams would share if they relocated to the Los Angeles market.

No NFL team has played in the Los Angeles market since the Raiders and Rams departed in 1994 -- the Raiders to Oakland, the Rams to St. Louis.

Butts said he envisions the stadium hosting a range of events.

“College football, the World Cup, championship boxing, the Final Four, there will be a number of events that will be glad to be in the newest stadium in the country,” he said.

1DPzFIi,2015-03-03 00:00:00,Former CIA Head David Petraeus to Plead Guilty - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/cia-head-david-petraeus-plead-guilty/story?id=29340487,"Decorated war veteran and former CIA director David Petraeus has entered into an agreement with federal prosecutors in which he would plead guilty to a misdemeanor charge for mishandling classified information.

The charge, unauthorized removal and retention of classified material, stems, in part, from documents the former director allegedly provided to his mistress.

In November 2012, Petraeus resigned as director of the CIA after little more than a year on the job. For 37 years before that, he served in the U.S. Army, including as commander of American forces in Iraq and Afghanistan.

The plea deal reached with prosecutors includes a recommendation of two years of probation and a $40,000 fine, according to court documents.

Petraeus provided Broadwell access to his “Black Books,” which contained Petraeus' notes, including highly classified material from his command in Afghanistan, according to charging documents in the case.

“A total of eight such books ... contained classified information regarding the identities of covert officers, war strategy, intelligence capabilities and mechanisms, diplomatic discussion, quotes and deliberative discussion from high-level National Security Council meetings, and defendant David Howell Petraeus’s discussions with the president of the United States of America,"" the documents said.

Following the agreement with Petraeus, the Justice Department issued a statement: “Three documents -- a criminal information, a plea agreement and a statement of facts -- were filed today in the United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina’s Charlotte Division in the case of United States v. David Howell Petraeus. The criminal information charges the defendant with one count of unauthorized removal and retention of classified material. ... The plea agreement and corresponding statement of facts, both signed by the defendant, indicate that he will plead guilty to the one-count criminal information.""

Petraeus’ attorney, David Kendall told ABC News he had “no comment” on the guilty plea.

Petraeus and Broadwell met while Broadwell was a graduate student at Harvard University working on a dissertation about Petraeus. She ultimately gained tremendous access to the decorated war hero and former four-star general, publishing his biography, “All In,” in January 2012 -- just 10 months before his resignation from the CIA.

Their affair became public by chance. The FBI was trying figure out who had been sending allegedly harassing emails to a Florida woman with ties to senior U.S. military officials.

The FBI traced the emails to Broadwell, and a review of her communications ultimately led the FBI to discover her affair with Petraeus, who was married.

Though Broadwell had a security clearance of her own, the affair raised some national security concerns. Federal authorities wondered whether Petraeus had given her access to information she wasn’t authorized to see, and they wanted to know if she had stored classified material at her home.

Within days of the affair becoming public, FBI agents searched Broadwell’s home in North Carolina.

In recent months, some federal investigators have been pushing more senior officials within the Justice Department to file charges against Petraeus. Eric Holder, however, had yet to sign off on such a move.

In an interview with ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos in January, Holder insisted the Petraeus probe was still “ongoing” and was being “done in a fair and an appropriate way.”

Broadwell was not charged in the case.

Since their affair became public, Petraeus and Broadwell have separately apologized for any pain caused to family, friends and supporters.

In addition, in a private letter to a friend two weeks after his resignation, Petraeus wrote: “I screwed up royally. ... I paid the price, appropriately.”

In 2013, Petraeus joined the global investment firm KKR. He also serves as a visiting professor of public policy at the City University of New York's Macaulay Honors College and serves on several veterans organizations' advisory boards, according to KKR's website.

The online message board is adopting new privacy guidelines months after private nude photos that were stolen from celebrities were posted on the Internet message board.

For nearly a decade, Reddit has been everything from a conduit for intelligent conversation to a dumping ground for questionable content. When it comes to cracking down on users, Reddit has long been averse to rules and, instead, let its millions-strong community police the boards.

Announcing a new  privacy policy today, the site's executive team wrote, ""Last year, we missed a chance to be a leader in social media when it comes to protecting your privacy -- something we've cared deeply about since reddit's inception.""

Effective March 10, Reddit users will no longer be allowed to post sexually explicit photos without the subject's consent. Anyone with an issue can flag a photo to expedite its removal.

""No matter who you are, if a photograph, video, or digital image of you in a state of nudity, sexual excitement, or engaged in any act of sexual conduct, is posted or linked to on reddit without your permission, it is prohibited on reddit,"" the company's executive team wrote. ""We also recognize that violent personalized images are a form of harassment that we do not tolerate and we will remove them when notified.""

Reddit said it will keep data on how many photos it removes and will share the number in its annual privacy report.

The company removed a thread containing the stolen celebrity photos last year. However, then-CEO Yishan Wong said although Reddit was sympathetic to the celebrities whose stolen photos were posted, it was ""unlikely to make changes to our existing site content policies in response to this specific event."""

The All-Star struck back at two Internet trolls in particular who made vulgar remarks, with Schilling revealing their identities and schools on his blog.

The crude comments were in response to Schilling's congratulatory tweet to his daughter's acceptance to college in Rhode Island.

Congrats to Gabby Schilling who will pitch for the Salve Regina Seahawks next year!!

Despite spending years around jock talk in locker rooms, Schilling, who last played in 2007, said the tweets, which alluded to lewd acts and rape, crossed the line.

""Anybody that reads it and says it's just a joke, I know a couple things for a fact, they're not fathers of kids,"" Schilling told “Good Morning America.""

Schilling, 48, posted images of some of the vulgar Tweets on his blog Sunday, writing, ""is this even remotely ok? In ANY world? At ANY time?""

""I grew up in a locker room. I grew up playing sports. I know what it means to be a guy. Never in my life, have I ever uttered half of the words that these guys were posting,"" Schilling said.

True to what Schilling wrote in his blog, where he wrote, ""The real world has consequences when you do and say things about others,"" there were consequences for the trolls.

The school of one of the Twitter users, Brookdale Community College in New Jersey, said it suspended the student.

""The student has been summarily suspended and will be scheduled for a conduct hearing where further disciplinary action will be taken,"" the college posted on its Facebook page Monday. ""The Brookdale Police are actively investigating this matter. Brookdale takes this behavior very seriously and does not tolerate any form of harassment. Our sincerest apologies to Gabby Schilling. Her achievement should be celebrated and not clouded by offensive comments.""

Each Twitter account mentioned in Schilling's blog has been suspended or is no longer in use.

Another Twitter user mentioned by Schilling in his blog was fired from his job selling tickets part-time with the New York Yankees, Jason Zillo, the team's director of communications, confirmed to NJ.com. The Yankees did not respond to a request for comment from ABC News.

The two individuals did not respond to a request for comment from ABC News.

""This wasn't a mistake,"" Schilling said. ""This was a conscious decision to be an idiot and to say some evil stuff.""

Gabby Schilling added: ""Nobody should be able to get away with saying things like that to a father about their daughter."""

It's where the media mogul became a superstar and where she first planted her showbiz roots.

But in an interview with the Hollywood Reporter posted today, Winfrey revealed Harpo Studios in Chicago will be shut down by year's end in favor of a transition to OWN headquarters in L.A. This move ends Harpo's 26-year run in the Windy City.

OWN just moved into its new space at West Hollywood's The Lot.

""I've spent more hours in this building than I have any other building on Earth. ... We were here when there was nothing but hoes and rats on the street, and now it's one of the hottest neighborhoods [in Chicago],"" she told the magazine.

The talk-show host and actress, 61, added: ""The time had come to downsize this part of the business and to move forward. It will be sad to say goodbye, but I look ahead with such a knowing that what the future holds is even more than I can see.""

Winfrey noted that top OWN execs had been going back and forth between Chicago and Los Angeles and that she wanted all her operations in one place. OWN has been around for the past four years and plans to expand further.

Around 200 employees will be impacted by the closing of the Chicago offices. The report adds that a ""small group"" of Chicago employees will join OWN.

The interview also notes that Winfrey will soon see how much time she has to get back in front of the camera on the big screen, including an upcoming Richard Pryor biopic.

The shooting occurred Saturday evening, just as Monroeville Mall security were starting to respond to a reports of a large group of teenagers becoming disorderly in the Polo section of the Macy's Department store, according to the criminal complaint released today.

Police said Macy's surveillance video showed the suspect firing a gun just as a couple, accompanied by their son, crossed between him and his apparent intended target.

The alleged shooter wasn't found at the scene, but investigators matched store surveillance video to a picture posted to Instagram about four hours before the shooting to identify the suspect as Tarod Thornhill, police said.

Thornhill was later arrested on three counts of aggravated assault, four counts of recklessly endangering another person, risking catastrophe and other charges. He is being charged as an adult and was taken to the Allegheny County jail to await arraignment, according to police.

Police identified the alleged intended victim as Davon Jones, 20, and the wounded bystanders as Mary Singleton, 47, and John Singleton, 48.

The victims were taken to Forbes regional hospital, where the two men were listed in critical condition and remain in the ICU, while the woman is in fair condition, officials said. All three are expected to survive, officials said.

Josh Vehar, a man at the mall with his 5-year-old daughter, told ABC News he saw a young man firing into a crowd of people. He said he was in the Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood Play, about 20 to 30 feet away from where the shooting took place at the Macy's department store.

""I watched this kid pull his gun out and when he pulled the gun out, he just started firing,"" Vehar said. ""He shot like six, seven times and then it just turned into pandemonium after that."""
1DQnzi3,2015-03-03 00:00:00,Hillary Clinton's State Department Email: What We Know About Her Use of a Private Account - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/hillary-clintons-state-department-email-private-account/story?id=29352617,"Hillary Clinton used a private email account to communicate while serving as secretary of state, The New York Times revealed.

Clinton's team has confirmed that she used a personal email account for government business but maintained that it worked within ""both the letter and the spirit"" of State Department rules. An aide later added that Clinton did not violate any laws and her team has turned over all relevant emails to the State Department for preservation.

The Times reported that she did not have a government email account, which would have ended with a federal government domain -- in this case, state.gov. Such emails are automatically stored on government servers and kept as federal records.

The domain ""clintonemail.com"" was registered the week before she was sworn in as secretary of state in 2009, The Washington Post reported -- but Clinton's team has not confirmed that she used an email at that address.

There hasn't been enough information released yet to determine exactly what rules were broken, if any, but there are clear disclosure and security concerns.

Government email accounts have their messages automatically stored as part of the Federal Records Act, and while it's clear that Clinton's personal account would not have fallen under that umbrella, her team noted that much of her correspondence still was covered, as a result.

""For government business, she emailed them on their department accounts, with every expectation they would be retained,"" Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill said in a statement.

However, as The Times noted, emails to accounts outside the U.S. government would not be covered by the same rules.

Did Hillary Clinton violate federal rules by using only her personal email account as sec of state? My @GMA report: http://t.co/4F8YvPjiqq

Clinton's team now has gone through her personal emails and forwarded any dealing with official business to the State Department for preservation, White House spokesman Josh Earnest reiterated during the daily White House news briefing today.

Earnest deferred numerous questions about the propriety of Clinton's private email use to State Department officials.

Spokeswoman Jen Psaki said that the State Department ""has long had access to a wide array"" of Clinton's records, including emails to people using state.gov accounts as well as diplomatic cables, but she did not explicitly address emails that Clinton sent that involved non-governmental accounts.

Another spokeswoman, Marie Harf, said there was “no prohibition” on using personal email for government business as long as it was preserved. However, she could not say with confidence that Clinton provided the State Department with every relevant email from her personal account.

Harf said no classified business was conducted on Clinton’s email.

We don't know the extent of the security measures taken with her external account and whether they matched the measures taken by her colleagues who used government email accounts. Government accounts have their messages encrypted, for instance.

Harf could not say Clinton’s emails were secure. Asked how the department could guarantee their security, she said, “I don’t know, you’d have to ask her [Clinton].”

According to Merrill, Clinton's spokesman, no. He said that ""secretaries of state before her"" also used their own email accounts while ""engaging with department officials."" That response, however, did not specify whether those secretaries of state used both government and private email accounts or just private email accounts like Clinton did, and it didn't specify whether those secretaries of state were operating under earlier sets of rules governing government employees' email conduct.

Without naming names, a senior state department official reiterated Merrill's claims that Clinton's predecessors practiced a similar private email policy.

""It is our understanding that secretaries prior to Secretary Kerry didn't regularly use an official State Department account,"" the senior state department official told ABC News.

However, two prior secretaries of state either exclusively used government email or used no email at all, and a third avoided private email for classified matters, sources close to them told ABC News.

An official close to Condoleezza Rice, who led the State Department for three years preceding Clinton under George W. Bush, said Rice never used a personal email account for State Department business.

Peggy Cifrino, a spokesman for Colin Powell, the prior secretary of state, said the emails he did send from a personal account were mostly unclassified in nature and that his office has pledged to hand over any required emails in keeping with new policies designed to track electronic communications from senior government officials.

A former State Department official close to Madeline Albright, who preceded Powell as secretary of state in the late '90s, said she didn't use email at all.

The New York Times reported that Clinton's use of a personal account was first discovered during a House committee's investigation into the 2012 attack on the American consulate in Benghazi, Libya. However, the State Department apparently just handed over a selection of about 300 emails to the committee two weeks ago.

Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the ranking Democrat on the Benghazi Select Committee, issued a statement this morning saying that it has been known ""for several years that Secretary Clinton used her personal email account, apparently following the pattern of previous secretaries of state.""

On top of that, anyone who received an email from her after she took over the State Department in 2009 would have recognized at the time that they were receiving an email from a non-state.gov address.

To quote another famous female politician, you betcha. Though Clinton has not yet announced her candidacy, her likely opponent, Jeb Bush, has already slammed her secretive move, saying that it lacked transparency.

Transparency matters. Unclassified @HillaryClinton emails should be released. You can see mine, here. http://t.co/wZbtwd8O2j

Investigators returned to the factory today in the Red Hook section, a day after the owner shot and killed himself in an apparent suicide as authorities raided it. police said.

There's a good chance the cherry atop your sundae or at the bottom of your Manhattan is from Dell's Maraschino Cherries, a family business founded in 1948 that now appears to have also hosted what sources described to ABC News as a large-scale, elaborate marijuana growing operation.

A team of city and state environmental regulators, along with prosecutors from the Brooklyn District Attorney's Office, had been at the company for several hours Tuesday investigating a complaint of illegal chemical dumping in the waters off Red Hook, prosecutors said.

At first owner Arthur Mondella, 57, cooperated with the search, police said. Then, as investigators discovered ""flimsy shelving and a faint smell of marijuana,"" a source briefed on the investigation said, Mondella became increasingly vague.

When a team member said, ""Well we're going to get a warrant to get behind this wall"" that's when Mondella ""excused himself to his private bathroom where he apparently shot himself and died at a local hospital,"" a statement from the Brooklyn District Attorney's office said.

Prior to the gunshot, a source said Mondella yelled to his sister, who had been standing outside the bathroom: ""Take care of my kids.""

About 80 pounds of marijuana were recovered in three huge bags. Hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash was also found on the property, authorities said.

Several luxury cars were also recovered, including a Rolls-Royce, a Porsche and Harley-Davidson motorcycle.

Mondella has a couple prior arrests, but they are sealed. A previous 2011 arrest for assaulting his second wife at their former Brighton Beach home had been dropped, authorities said.

Dell's Maraschino Cherries had recently undergone a $5 million makeover of its Red Hook plant which employs a dozen people.

The investigation into environmental crimes continues though it remains unclear whether anyone would now face charges."
1DrlLLc,2015-02-01 00:00:00,New ISIS Video Purports to Show Beheading of Japanese Reporter - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/International/isis-video-purports-show-beheading-japanese-reporter/story?id=28630750,"A 66-second ISIS video purports to show the beheading of Japanese reporter Kenji Goto, a gruesome end to a week of failed negotiations.

There was no immediate comment from Japanese or U.S. intelligence officials, but the video appears to show the detached head of the 46-year-old reporter who was captured late last year by the terror group while on assignment in Syria.

The video, titled ""A Message to the Japanese Government,"" begins with Goto on his knees in a river valley. A masked man with a knife in his hand speaks with a British accent, addressing Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.

Shortly after the video's release, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said he felt ""very sorry for this matter,"" according to Japan's NHK news outlet.

""The government has tried its best to deal with this matter, but we are deeply saddened by this despicable and horrendous act of terrorism and we denounce it in the strongest terms,"" he said. ""To the terrorists, we would never, never forgive them for this act."" He said Japan would continue fighting against terrorism.

Prior to Abe's comments, Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said word has gone out to government departments to meet to ""collect intelligence and to respond firmly to this matter.""

Calling it a ""barbaric act,"" President Obama condemned ""the heinous murder.""
Goto ""courageously sought to convey the plight of the Syrian people,"" Obama said in a written statement, adding that ""we stand in solidarity with Prime Minister Abe and the Japanese people.""

Goto's brother and mother reacted with shock and sadness.

""I was hoping Kenji would come back alive to thank everyone who had supported him,"" his brother Junichi told Japanese public broadcaster NHK TV. ""I am filled with sadness he couldn't do it.""

Before his death, audio messages from Goto were published online by ISIS last week, relaying ISIS's offer to free Goto, but only if Jordan released a convicted female al Qaeda member, Sajida al-Rishawi, from death row. If the Jordanians did not release al-Rishawi, ISIS said through Goto, then Goto and a Jordanian pilot also held captive by the terror group would be killed. The Jordanian government publicly said they would release al-Rishawi, but only in return for the pilot.

Al-Rishawi has been in prison for a decade for her role in an al Qaeda bombing attack in Jordan in 2005 that killed dozens, including many at a wedding party.

ISIS set a hard deadline for al-Rishawi's release for sunset on Thursday, but the Jordanians didn't budge, saying ISIS had not provided proof of life their pilot was alive. Amid the tense negotiations, top Japanese officials had said they were working closely with Jordan to find a way to gain freedom for their citizen.

The status of the Jordanian pilot is unclear, but Goto now joins a number of Western civilians, and scores of locals who were murdered by the terror group."

The All-Star struck back at two Internet trolls in particular who made vulgar remarks, with Schilling revealing their identities and schools on his blog.

The crude comments were in response to Schilling's congratulatory tweet to his daughter's acceptance to college in Rhode Island.

Congrats to Gabby Schilling who will pitch for the Salve Regina Seahawks next year!!

Despite spending years around jock talk in locker rooms, Schilling, who last played in 2007, said the tweets, which alluded to lewd acts and rape, crossed the line.

""Anybody that reads it and says it's just a joke, I know a couple things for a fact, they're not fathers of kids,"" Schilling told “Good Morning America.""

Schilling, 48, posted images of some of the vulgar Tweets on his blog Sunday, writing, ""is this even remotely ok? In ANY world? At ANY time?""

""I grew up in a locker room. I grew up playing sports. I know what it means to be a guy. Never in my life, have I ever uttered half of the words that these guys were posting,"" Schilling said.

True to what Schilling wrote in his blog, where he wrote, ""The real world has consequences when you do and say things about others,"" there were consequences for the trolls.

The school of one of the Twitter users, Brookdale Community College in New Jersey, said it suspended the student.

""The student has been summarily suspended and will be scheduled for a conduct hearing where further disciplinary action will be taken,"" the college posted on its Facebook page Monday. ""The Brookdale Police are actively investigating this matter. Brookdale takes this behavior very seriously and does not tolerate any form of harassment. Our sincerest apologies to Gabby Schilling. Her achievement should be celebrated and not clouded by offensive comments.""

Each Twitter account mentioned in Schilling's blog has been suspended or is no longer in use.

Another Twitter user mentioned by Schilling in his blog was fired from his job selling tickets part-time with the New York Yankees, Jason Zillo, the team's director of communications, confirmed to NJ.com. The Yankees did not respond to a request for comment from ABC News.

The two individuals did not respond to a request for comment from ABC News.

""This wasn't a mistake,"" Schilling said. ""This was a conscious decision to be an idiot and to say some evil stuff.""

Gabby Schilling added: ""Nobody should be able to get away with saying things like that to a father about their daughter."""

The lucky boy was Christopher Warner of Marriottsville, Maryland, a 10-year-old Maroon 5 superfan who has Down Syndrome.

""He's an awesome kid,"" said Maroon 5 keyboardist, PJ Morton. ""He was a little shy from all of the attention. He didn't want to stand up to take a picture so we all got on the floor with him to take it that way. I got a high five!""

Christopher's teacher, Avery Stanert, told ABC News that she recorded him singing and dancing to hits like ""One More Night,"" which she posted on YouTube on Feb. 23.

""I tweeted it out to the Kane Show who got him [Christopher] backstage passes,"" said Stanert, special needs teacher at West Friendship Elementary School. I know that when he went backstage Adam Levine said that he had seen the video at that point.""

Christopher and his mom Cecilia went to the Maroon 5 show on Monday night, where she said he was able to meet each member of the band.

""He was real excited,"" said the mother of three. ""They told us that we would be last because Adam wanted to talk with Christopher and spend a little more time with him.

""When he [Christopher] realized it was his turn, he was very shy at first. I kind of got down on the floor and he was hiding behind me. Then Adam said 'that’s ok, we’ll all get down on the floor.' It wasn’t beneath him to lay down on a locker room floor with Christopher."""

That's how Donna Scharton remembers her beloved parents, Floyd and Violet Hartwig, before they died on Feb. 11.

The couple, who had been married for 67 years, died in their home in a very ""Notebook""-like situation.

As the two laid close to one another, Scharton and other immediate family members pushed their beds close together as they all knew the end was near.

""My mom had dementia for the last several years and around the holidays we noticed she was going down,"" Scharton of Fresno, California said. ""Then, I got a call from the doctor saying 'your dad has kidney failure and he has two weeks to live.' So, we decided to put them in hospice together.""

Prior to their declining health, the Hartwigs owned a ranch in Easton, California. The two met while in grammar school and had developed a relationship upon Mr. Hartwig returning home from the Navy.

They married on Aug. 16, 1947 and had two other children, Carol and Kenneth, in addition to Scharton.

""My dad was in the Navy for six years,"" she told ABC News. ""He worked for the J.B. Hill Company delivering eggs and then for a feed company. Mom stayed home, helped take care of the ranch, and cooked all the meals. She made breakfast for dad at 4:30 in the morning every day.""

Scharton said that although his health was deteriorating, her father's main priority was the love of his life.

""He would tell the doctor, 'I'm okay I just want her fixed',” she added. ""That was his concern; not how bad his pain was, but that he wanted my mom fixed.""

""We could tell my dad was in a lot more pain,"" Scharton cried. ""We said 'it's getting close,' so we pushed the hospital beds together as far as we could. We put their hands together, and my dad died holding my mom's hand. Mom was not coherent, but we told her that dad had passed away and that he was waiting for her. She died five hours later.""

Scharton's daughter, Cynthia Letson, remembers her grandparents as simple people who just loved having their family beside them.

""They never, ever asked for anything,"" she said. ""All they ever wanted was their family and it was amazing that they got that in the end.""

In honor of their legacy, Scharton is holding onto warm memories of her mother and father.

""Mom did a lot of sewing – made our clothes and stuff,"" Scharton said. ""She joined the PTA at school and she loved doing her crossword puzzles. They were very devoted and when dad came home we'd always have supper together.

""I remember them kissing each other goodbye every morning. I remember mom called him Blondie because he had such pretty blonde hair and blue eyes.""

""What I want people to get out of this story is my dad's commitment to serving his country and loving his family. ""What we felt was keeping them alive was the will to live, and that they didn’t want to let go of each other."""
1Dt3BK3,2015-02-26 00:00:00,"Weed The People: What You Need to Know About Pot Legalization in Washington, DC - ABC News",http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/weed-people-pot-legalization-washington-dc/story?id=29227305,"The citizens of the District of Columbia in November voted to pass Initiative 71, which legalized the possession of up to two ounces of marijuana and the cultivation of up to three marijuana plants for individuals over the age of 21. That measure is scheduled to take effect at midnight Thursday.

However, the initiative did not create funding for the regulation of the substance, which would be required to legalize sales. The measure was put on the ballot through citizen initiative, and in D.C., citizen initiatives cannot mandate spending.

Here are some key points you need to know:

What Congress Has to Say About It:

Congress attempted to block the implementation of the law by attaching language to a continuing resolution that passed in December that blocks funding of any sort from being appropriated to legalize marijuana for recreational purposes. House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, sent a letter to Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser saying that Initiative 71 cannot go into effect under the law.

Congress had a 30-day layover period to review the initiative after it was transmitted to Congress in January. During that time, Congress could have rejected the measure using a joint resolution of disapproval. Congress has not passed such a measure, but Chaffetz said the language in the continuing resolution prevents the law from moving forward without a joint resolution of disapproval.

What Happens Thursday:

Regardless of the legality, the Metropolitan Police Department takes orders from the city. So unless the city changes its mind, marijuana will be legal in D.C. Thursday.

Here is a cheat sheet to help you better understand what is allowed and not allowed.

In D.C., you can ...

... possess up to two ounces of marijuana on your person. Any amount more than two ounces is still illegal and will amount to a misdemeanor with a fine of $1,000, or as much as to six months in jail.

... give up to one ounce as a gift. Though selling is prohibited, individuals may exchange as much as once ounce as a gift.

... grow up to six marijuana plants. However, the law says you may only possess three “mature, flowering plants” at any given time -- with the provision intended to make it more difficult to grow enough marijuana to sell.

In D.C., you cannot ...

... grow marijuana outside of your residence. The law allows for growing, but it must be “within the interior of a house, building or rental unit that constitutes such a person’s principal residence.”

... consume marijuana in public. You can have it on your person, but you cannot legally consume it publicly in any fashion.

... sell the substance in any quantity. Purchasing or selling the drug is illegal. However, you may transfer up to one ounce to another individual for free as a gift.

... drive while under the influence of marijuana. Unlike alcohol, there’s no “legal limit,” per se. It’s illegal to drive while under the influence of any amount of marijuana.

... have marijuana in your possession on any federal land. Legalization is only in local D.C. territory. Some examples of places you cannot have the substance in your possession include the National Mall and the Capitol.

In D.C., it’s not a good idea to ...

... have pot in your possession anywhere you might be stopped by U.S. Park Police or Capitol Police. The Capitol Police and Park Police enforce federal law around the Capitol. According to the U.S. Capitol Police’s website, this includes about a 47-square block radius around the Capitol. So even if you are not going anywhere you can actually see the Capitol building, you might want to think twice before putting that weed in your pocket."
1DtgVAW,2015-03-16 00:00:00,Grad Students Restore Damaged Photos For Couple Who Lost Sons in Fatal Fire - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/US/grad-students-restore-damaged-photos-couple-lost-sons/story?id=29669586,"Damaged photographs rescued from a fire that killed three young brothers and their grandmother in Washington Court House, Ohio, recently received the kind of treatment usually given to historical artifacts in museums.

Over 260 photos that suffered fire and water damage in the tragic accident were restored by graduate students in a photo conservation class at the University of Delaware. The photos were delivered back to Ricky Harris and Traci Harris, the parents of the three brothers lost in the fire, last Friday.

""It was bittersweet experience,"" family friend and UDel doctoral student Michael Emmons told ABC News today. ""The photos won't bring back Ricky and Traci's children and Ricky's mom, but it's powerful that they're able to save these memories.""

Emmons discovered the damaged photos laid out in Ricky's garage while on his way to pay his condolences last December, he said.

The hundreds of photos were charred, covered in soot and stained by the water used to fight the blaze that took the lives of 60-year-old Terry Harris and her grandsons Kenyon, 14, Broderick, 11, and Braylon, 9.

Emmons then contacted Debra Hess Norris, chairman of UDel's art conservation department and photo conservation professor, asking if she knew of any way to help restore the photos for the Harris family.

Coincidentally, Norris was prepping for a photo conservation class, Emmons said, and she switched out her original class project plans to help the Harris family, using their photos for the class project instead.

The students worked late nights and weekends to restore every photograph one-by-one, Norris told ABC News today.

""It was a labor of love on the part of everyone,"" Norris said. ""The project was such a great example of why preservation of cultural heritage is so important. Just seeing the memories they contain, it was a very moving and real affirmation as to why we're involved in this field.""

The photographs included both black-and-white and color portraits, Polaroids, and photo booth prints and snapshots, Norris said.

Every image was treated differently according to its particular damage, she added.

""At times, many of us were in tears,"" Norris said. ""We felt a strong personal connection to the images.""

Norris flew to Ohio with Emmons to personally deliver the photos at a community gathering held at a local youth recreational center, she said.

Ricky and Traci said they were very grateful for the photos and the work students did to restore them, but it's difficult to see the people they can no longer hug in person.

""When I look in their eyes in those pictures, you see them like physically, like I am looking at you guys, I can grab you guys, but I can't grab them,"" Ricky told ABC News affiliate WSYX.

ABC News' attempts to contact Ricky and Traci for additional comment were unsuccessful.

The cause of the blaze hasn't been determined yet, the the state fire marshal's office said Friday, WSYX reported, but Ricky said he thinks a propane gas leak started the fire.

The fire destroyed the house and its contents, but the photographs were discovered in a tub, charred and wet, WSYX added."
1DTOIka,2015-03-04 00:00:00,Family of California Teen Declared Brain Dead Sues Hospital for Malpractice - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Health/family-california-teen-declared-brain-dead-sues-hospital/story?id=29363442,"The California family that fought to keep their teenage daughter on life support after she was declared brain dead is suing her doctor and the hospital where she went into cardiac arrest for negligence and wrongful death -- if ""it is determined"" that the girl indeed succumbed to her injuries.

Jahi McMath was 13 years old when her heart stopped at Benioff Children's Hospital in Oakland, California, after complications from surgery to cure her sleep apnea in December 2013. Then, doctors declared her brain dead, but her family fought and won a legal battle to move her from California to a long-term care facility in New Jersey, where her mother told ABC News she can respond to basic commands by moving her feet and arms.

""The mother never had any explanation as to how this happened,"" Brusavich said. ""But it doesn't really change anything in terms of the profound brain damage to the child.""

The suit, an advance copy that Brusavich gave to ABC News, alleges that the doctor was negligent because he did not follow the standard of care for treating Jahi's sleep apnea and instead opted for invasive surgery on Dec. 9, 2013, removing her tonsils, adenoids, soft pallet and uvula as well as doing work on the inside of her nose. The doctor allegedly noted that Jahi might have a malformed carotid artery at the surgical site, which would have put her at risk for life-threatening bleeding, but he didn't inform the medical staff after he noticed it during surgery , according to the suit.

When Jahi's parents were allowed to see her after surgery at 7:30 p.m., they say they were concerned because she was coughing up a lot of blood, according to the suit. After the nurses disagreed over whether to suction the blood or let Jahi's blood clot so she could heal, her mother asked that a doctor be called, according to the suit. They ""estimated that Jahi had lost three pints of blood or more,"" according to the suit.

The suit alleges that the surgeon did not come until after midnight to check on Jahi as she deteriorated and her oxygen and heart rate took a dive. The doctor allegedly wasn't summoned until Jahi's grandmother, a nurse at another hospital, shouted at Jahi's nurses to do so, according to the suit. When a doctor arrived, he said ""S***, her heart stopped,"" according to the suit. They tried to revive the teen for two hours and 33 minutes, but they never performed an emergency tracheotomy, according to the suit. They pumped about two liters of blood out of her lungs, it says.

In the days that followed, the hospital allegedly told Jahi's parents that she had ""sustained significant brain damage,"" and they put her on the organ donor list and were preparing to take her off life support, the suit says. They never got an explanation for how this happened to Jahi, the suit says.

""What is it you don't understand? She is dead, dead, dead, dead!"" the hospital's chief of pediatrics told the family, according to the suit.

The family is suing for personal injuries, negligent infliction of personal distress and wrongful death, if it is eventually determined that Jahi died in December 2013, which would go against the family's repeated assertion for more than a year that Jahi is not brain dead.

The family will seek damages, but a dollar figure was not listed on the suit. Brusavich told ABC News that non-economic damages in California cannot exceed $250,000.

The hospital released the following statement to ABC News: ""Our hearts go out to the McMath family. It is our policy not to comment on pending litigation."""

A spokesperson for the U.S. attorney’s office and the FBI declined to comment and authorities said no decision has been made on whether to eventually bring charges while prosecutors concentrate on the trial of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, Russell’s brother-in-law.

Katherine Russell, who was married to Tamerlan Tsarnaev, is suspected of being the woman who accompanied Tsarnaev to a Macy’s in Boston two months before the April 2013 attack where he bought five pressure cookers – two of which were allegedly used to make the bombs placed at the marathon finish line. In an affidavit to search the Tsarnaev’s home, FBI agents said they were looking for clothing consistent with those seen on a security video at Macy’s.

A few weeks earlier Tamerlan Tsarnaev had gone to a fireworks store in New Hampshire and bought 48 mortar shells, also used in the bombs. At the fireworks store, Tamerlan had asked for the “biggest and loudest” fireworks available and spent roughly $200, according to court documents.

“To live in a small apartment and buy five pressure cookers and have all those explosives obviously just does not make sense – something other than cooking was going on,” said former FBI special agent and ABC News consultant Brad Garrett.

Lawyers for Russell and federal prosecutors initially declined to answer ABC News questions about Russell’s status, but a senior law enforcement official said she could face charges of misprision of a felony, or failing to notify authorities of a crime about to happen.

Following Tuesday’s ABC News report on Russell, an attorney for Russell, Joshua Dratel, said in a written statement to ABC News, “There is no video of Ms. Russell at a Macy’s in connection with the purchase of pressure cookers, and any claim that there is such a video, or any claim remotely approaching that, is false. Also false is any allegation that Ms. Russell was involved in the purchase of any pressure cookers, or that she accompanied her late husband with respect to any such purchase by him.”

Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed in a police shootout three days after prosecutors say he and his younger brother, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, detonated twin bombs near the finish line of the Boston Marathon, killing three people – including an eight-year-old boy – and injuring some 260 others.

Days after Tamerlan was identified as one of the suspected bombers, another of Russell’s attorneys at the time, released a statement saying Russell was assisting the investigation into the bombing and was not aware of the plot beforehand.

“As a mother, a sister, a daughter, a wife, Katie deeply mourns the pain and loss to innocent victims, students, law enforcement officers, families and our community,” the attorney, Miriam Weizenbaum, said then.

Shortly after the bombing, Russell left her family and moved to New Jersey to live with Tsarnaev’s two sisters. She later moved out of her sister-in-law’s apartment and was last seen in a transitional housing facility for the homeless in New Jersey, according to authorities briefed on the investigation. Authorities told ABC News the FBI put Russell under surveillance during last year’s Boston Marathon race.

Opening statements in the murder trial of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev are set to begin Wednesday morning. Russell is not expected to be called as a witness for the government.

Danish police shot and killed the 22-year-old man early today in a shootout with police in the Noerrebro district of Copenhagen, Danish investigator Joergen Skov told The Associated Press.

He was believed to be responsible for shootings at a free speech event and a synagogue in Copenhagen that officials said were likely inspired by last month's terror attacks in Paris.

According to Copenhagen police, at about 5 a.m., the suspect was returning to an address that was under police surveillance. When officers tried to make contact with the suspect, he shot at them. The officers returned fire, killing him.

Police said they had found an automatic weapon that may have been the one used in the attack at the free speech event, according to the AP.

""Nothing at this point suggests there were other perpetrators"" in the Saturday shootings, Skov said. Police officials said at a news conference Sunday that they knew who the suspect was but have not yet released his identity, only saying he was from Copenhagen.

The first shooting happened about 4 p.m. Saturday at an event titled ""Art, Blasphemy and Freedom of Expression,"" organized by Swedish artist Lars Vilks, who has faced several threats after caricaturing the Prophet Muhammad.

Vilks told Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet that he ""heard some shots. They sounded weak so I didn't think they sounded as gun shots. It was very surreal.""

""I'm not sure how many shots but I'd say about 20 or 30 shots,"" Dennis Myhoff-Brink, who witnessed the attack, told BBC News. ""People panicked of course and ran to the doors. Other people were hiding behind tables they had turned over.""

The 55-year-old victim in that shooting has been identified as filmmaker Finn Noergaard, a man who produced and directed documentaries for Danish television, according to the AP.

Vilks, 68, who was not injured in the shooting, said he believes he was the intended target.

""What other motive could there be? It's possible it was inspired by Charlie Hebdo,"" he told the AP.

""This is not unexpected ... not going to be the last time either,"" Vilks told Swedish newspaper ""Aftonbladet."" ""It could have been a massacre, what if the suspect would have gotten inside the venue... Of course this is a tragedy but it was expected. It would have happened sooner or later.""

""Denmark has been hit by terror,"" Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt said, according to the AP. ""We do not know the motive for the alleged perpetrator's actions, but we know that there are forces that want to hurt Denmark. They want to rebuke our freedom of speech.""

The shooting happened a month after gunmen opened fire on the Charlie Hebdo satirical magazine in Paris, killing 12 people. The magazine had published cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad, angering many Muslims.

In the days that followed, a police officer was killed and four others slain at a kosher grocery store inside the French capital.

Hours after the shooting at the cafe, police said Dan Uzan, a 37-year-old member of Copenhagen's Jewish community, was killed and two police officers were wounded in a shooting outside a synagogue.

Uzan was standing near the entrance when he was shot, acting as a security guard for a Bat Mitzvah party that was taking place inside, according to Copenhagen's main synagogue.

""It is a very sad morning where we all think of the victims and their relatives,"" Thornin-Schmidt said. ""Two innocent people have lost their lives because of a cynical terror action against Denmark.""

House Intelligence Committee ranking member Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., told ABC News that it's ""too early to tell"" if the shootings in Copenhagen were tied to ISIS or al Qaeda.

""We still don't know. Obviously they [the intelligence community] are working with Danish authorities to try to get to the bottom of -- was there an affiliation with al Qaeda or ISIS? Was this self-radicalization? Was this a copycat of what happened in Paris?"" Schiff said. ""It's still too early to tell.""

1Du2exx,2015-03-19 00:00:00,"'The Sound of Music' That Never Was: What Musical Creators, Filmmakers Changed - ABC News",http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/sound-music-musical-creators-filmmakers-changed/story?id=29613746,"“The Sound of Music” has remained one of the most iconic films in history since it was released 50 years ago.

It’s this Rodgers and Hammerstein classic that brought us songs like “Do Re Mi” and “My Favorite Things,” and told the story of a nun named Maria who dreamed of a different life, and became a part of the singing von Trapp family, all of which are ingrained in American culture.

But there are a few scenes from the 1965 film that were never shown, titles that were changed, and lyrics Oscar Hammerstein struggled with, which could have made the film completely different than the version we know and love today.

Here are a few things the musical creators, and then later filmmakers, changed about “The Sound of Music.”

1. The Title Was Originally Called 'Love Song'

In a telegram dated Feb. 6, 1959, lawyers for the original play pleaded with Rodgers and Hammerstein to ""PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE get a new title!"" for ""their forthcoming musical play"" because of copyright issues over the name, ""Love Song.""

""Over 300 musical compositions have already been copyrighted under that name,"" the telegram reads.

So the name was changed to ""The Sound of Music.""

2. 'My Favorite Things' Originally Had a Different Title and Lyrics

When Hammerstein was writing the song, ""My Favorite Things,"" he started off by literally writing down a list of some of his favorite things.

On one of Hammerstein early notes about the song, he wrote, “Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens, curling my fingers in warm woolen mittens, riding down a hill on my big brother’s bike, these are a few of the things that I like.”

Next to “curling” is the handwritten word “kettle,” and next to ""like"" is the handwritten phrase, ""my favorite things."" Today, we know the lyrics as “Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens, bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens, silver white winters that melt into spring, these are a few of my favorite things.”

The name of the song was also originally called “Good Things,” and Hammerstein crossed it out and changed it to “My Favorite Things.”

3. 'Do Re Mi' Was Originally Titled 'First Singing Lesson'

But was also later changed.

In the original play, ""Do Re Mi"" was the first song Maria sang to the von Trapp children, but for the movie, filmmakers made “My Favorite Things” the first song she sang with them instead. Originally, “My Favorite Things” was sang as a duet between Maria and the Mother Abbess.

4. Oscar Hammerstein Struggled With a Lyric for 'Sol'

When writing the song, “Do Re Mi,” Hammerstein wrote lyrics for each beat such as, “Do, a deer, a female deer, Re, a drop of golden sun,” but he struggled to come up with a lyric for the beat, “Sol,” which is pronounced “So,” but written both ways in his notes.

“So is a thing you do with grain, oat wheat,” reads one of Hammerstein’s handwritten notes about the song, as he tried out different lyrics.

It took him four days to come up with the lyric as we know it today: “So, a needle pulling thread.”

5. The 'Do Re Mi' Scene Was Supposed to Include a Maze

When performing “Do Re Mi” in the movie, Maria and the von Trapp children were supposed to be seen running and singing through a garden maze on the house grounds. Filmmakers even drew up storyboards of what the scene would look like, and every single beat of music in the song was timed exactly for the actors.

But in the end, the scene was scrapped.

6. There Was Supposed to Be a Scene with Maria, Rolf and Liesl

According to Burt Fink, the Rodgers and Hammerstein company’s senior vice president for Europe, there was a scene shot for the movie with Maria, Rolf and Liesl together, but it was cut for time.

In the film’s current version, Maria never meets Rolf.

The 27-year-old mother of two was diagnosed with stage IV cancer shortly after the holidays. At first, doctors thought it was lymphoma, which would have been curable. But they soon learned they didn't know where the cancer originated, and it was aggressive, she wrote.

They gave her six months to live without treatment, she wrote on her blog. If she underwent chemotherapy, she could have five years.

""I was doing the math in my head about how old they [her children] would be when I was supposed to die and I just -- it broke my heart,"" she told ABC's Charleston, South Carolina, affiliate WCIV-TV.

Her daughter is 6 and her son is 6 months old. WCIV was there when photographers snapped their first official family portrait as a family of four. Cox said she was hoping to do it before her hair fell out, but she was bald and beautiful for the cameras.

Since Cox started her blog a week ago, more than 12,000 people have viewed the posts about her journey with stage IV cancer. She writes that she hopes to renew others' faith in God through her experience and that she's praying for a miracle.

""I want people to realize how precious life is and how quickly it can be taken away from us,"" she wrote in a post. ""I want them to value their time on this earth with their families. I want them to hug their children a little tighter. I want them to believe in miracles, because I will get my miracle."""

Mothers say they plan to start asking other parents whether their children have had all their immunizations and, if they haven't, the play date is over.

Nichoel Kimmerle, who was outside the Los Angeles Zoo with her children, said she would ""absolutely"" tell other parents to vaccinate.

""More people are standing up and saying, 'This doesn't cause autism. We know it doesn't, so you need to vaccinate your children,'"" Kimmerle told ABC News. ""And I think some of us are questioning schools. How many kids aren't vaccinating in the school, and do I want to send my child there?""

""That's their choice in being mad because my kid didn't get all of his shots,"" Dotson told ABC's Oregon affiliate KATU-TV. ""But guess what: If my kid gets sick, he would be home.""

Dotson takes his children to an Oregon play cafe where the owner tells KATU she would love everyone to be vaccinated, but she won't ask unvaccinated children to leave.

Sheri Johnson, on the other hand, told ABC News she's thinking of vaccinating her children after avoiding the shots because her fiance doesn't believe in them.

""I’m thinking about looking into it more just to be on the extra safe side,"" she said, adding that she thinks it's every family's right to choose what's best for them.

Meanwhile, chatter beyond online parenting forums and Facebook groups has begun to heat up, as parents discuss the so-called ""vaccine wars.""

Lyss Stern, CEO of Divalyssious Moms, an 11-year-old lifestyle company based in New York, said the measles outbreak is a hot topic among her half a million members.

""The chatter and the buzz isn't just online,"" she said, adding that vaccine conversations are happening between parents on playgrounds, in classrooms, in doctor's offices and in restaurants. ""You have the right to ask ... the person throwing the birthday party. You have the right to ask if they know who's been vaccinated and who hasn't been.""

The measles outbreak has grown to 102 patients in 14 states, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which said most of the cases have been linked to mostly unvaccinated people at Disneyland.

Measles is so contagious that it can spread to an average of 18 people for every one person who gets it. Because the virus is airborne, it can linger in the air and infect someone after they've left a room, according to the CDC. It can also live on surfaces for hours.

Even worse, measles is contagious long before symptoms appear, according to the CDC.

Symptoms start with a fever and then a rash develops a few days later. Complications include pneumonia, hearing loss and swelling of the brain known as encephalitis.

""People don’t realize that at the turn of the century, 107 out of every 1,000 babies died before their first birthday,"" said Dr. Lolly McDavid, who directs UH Case Medical Center's child advocacy and protection program in Cleveland. ""Vaccines and clean water have been the number one cause for improvement in children's health in the United States.""

Nancy Aubry, who stood with her 3-month-old son outside Andi's Daycare in Los Angeles, said the measles outbreak makes her both angry and frightened.

""It's just bizarre that it's 2015 and this is even on the table,"" she said. ""My baby is too young to be immunized and so I feel like we’re at everybody else’s mercy until he’s old enough to get his own shots so I have to depend on others to do what they need to do to protect my little one while I can’t. I don’t think it’s fair that people can make that choice and put my baby in danger."""

Located 12.8 billion light-years from Earth, astronomers discovered the behemoth black hole inside of a quasar that shines 420 trillion times brighter than the sun, according to an article published Wednesday in the journal ""Nature.""

The quasar is so bright, scientists say, because of the radiation emitted as matter is accelerated and sucked into the massive black hole.

The ancient quasar was believed to have been shining brightly when the universe was less than a billion years old. With the universe now dated at 13.8 billion years old, the quasar is shining much brighter and is extraordinarily bigger than what scientists would have expected for the ancient body.

There are 40 known quasars that date back to the first one billion years after the Big Bang, according to scientists, with each having a black hole with the mass of one billion suns. By comparison, the newly discovered quasar, called SDSS J0100+2802, is a giant among giants.

The sheer size of the black hole has posed a new question about how something so massive was able to form at the dawn of time.

""How can a quasar so luminous, and a black hole so massive, form so early in the history of the universe, at an era soon after the earliest stars and galaxies have just emerged?"" Xiaohui Fan, a professor astronomy at the University of Arizona and co-author of the study, said in a statement. ""And what is the relationship between this monster black hole and its surrounding environment, including its host galaxy?""

It's another mystery of the universe that astronomers will continue to ponder."

In an announcement today, McDonald's said it will only source ""chicken raised without antibiotics that are important to human medicine.""

Gail Hansen, senior officer of the antibiotic resistance project at The Pew Charitable Trusts, said, “McDonald’s announcement is a big public health victory in the battle against antibiotic resistance.""

Hansen, a former state epidemiologist and state public health veterinarian for the Kansas Department of Health and Environment, and her colleagues have worked on phasing out the overuse of antibiotics in food production. Some health experts say the overuse of antibiotics in meat can contribute to the public health threat of ""superbugs.""

Many chicken producers use antibiotics to increase the rate of growth of their animals or to counter the effects of poor diets and unhealthy conditions, according to Keep Antibiotics Working senior analyst Steven Roach. The Natural Resources Defense Council and Keep Antibiotics Working are among the groups that have encouraged McDonald's to make this step over the last several years.

McDonald's U.S. restaurants will also offer customers milk from cows that are not treated with rbST, an artificial growth hormone.

""Our customers want food that they feel great about eating -- all the way from the farm to the restaurant -- and these moves take a step toward better delivering on those expectations,"" said McDonald's U.S President Mike Andres.

Jonathan Kaplan, director of NRDC's food and agriculture program, points out that McDonald's ""Global Vision"" statement doesn't include a ban on the use of all medically-important antibiotics in routine disease prevention, which some say can contribute to antibiotic resistance.

""Hopefully, chicken is just the start - the Big Mac and McRib may be next,"" Kaplan said, adding that he hopes McDonald's closes this ""loophole"" and applies their new U.S. chicken antibiotics curbs to all their restaurants globally.

In late 2013, the FDA announced a plan to phase out antibiotics in feed for growth promotion to prevent antibiotic resistance. But the announcement indicated farmers could still claim antibiotics were being used for illness prevention.

Rep. Louise Slaughter, D-NY, who has worked to “save antibiotics” and is the sole microbiologist in Congress, has previously proposed removing antibiotics from farms.

“Today’s announcement from McDonalds is encouraging, but until there is an enforceable, verifiable limit on agricultural antibiotic use, we will have no way to verify whether chicken raised on medically important antibiotics has been truly phased out,"" she said in a statement. ""Furthermore, I have called on McDonald’s to also phase out beef raised on medically important antibiotics, and I will continue to press them on that front.""

When asked if the company has similar plans for its beef supply, a spokeswoman for McDonald's said in a statement to ABC News, ""We continue to look at our menu and how we can evolve it based on what our customers tell us is important to them. We are proud of these initial steps we have announced today related to chicken and will be doing more going forward.""

As part of the company announcement today, McDonald’s USA was announced as a founding member of the newly formed U.S. Roundtable on Sustainable Beef, which includes organizations like Cargill, Walmart, World Wildlife Fund and The Nature Conservancy."
1DuRagS,2015-02-26 00:00:00,Net Neutrality: What's at Stake for You in Today's Vote - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/net-neutrality-stake-todays-vote/story?id=29240550,"The Federal Communications Commission today passed net neutrality rules after a decade-long debate over whether the Internet should be regulated in the same way as public utilities.

The commissioners voted 3-2 to reclassify Internet service providers as common carriers and impose utility-style regulations, preventing companies from degrading service, limiting access and creating a so-called fast lane with a tiered subscription approach.

FCC received more than 4 million comments on #OpenInternet during past year that helped shape proposal. It’s time to act.

Here's a quick breakdown of what net neutrality means for cable companies and consumers:

Cable Companies

While many Internet service providers say they're committed to a free Internet, what they want from the FCC is more leeway for how they package and sell various Internet plans. Activists have rallied against the idea over the fear it could create toll roads on the so-called ""information superhighway.""

Michael Powell, president and CEO of the National Cable and Telecommunications Association and the former chairman of the FCC, has previously said that over-regulation will not foster an even more open Internet.

What It Means for Consumers

Classifying the consumer broadband service as a public utility under Title II of the 1934 Communications Act would help control what consumers are charged and their access to Internet service, which would be deemed something critical to society.

In everyday terms, think of it this way: There won't be any uneven service, so everyone can stream their Netflix queue more or less at the same speeds. Supporters of net neutrality have also said that without regulation, a greater socio-economic digital divide could develop, creating a class of information ""haves"" and ""have nots.""

The President Weighs In

Since the FCC is an independent body, President Obama has no direct oversight. However, it didn't stop the commander-in-chief from weighing in on the matter of net neutrality last year.

Among the four basic points of the president's plan are no blocking websites for certain users, no throttling (creating a fast and slow lane), more transparency between consumers and Internet service providers, and no paid prioritization to move to the front of the line.

The @FCC just voted to keep the internet open & free. That's the power of millions making their voices heard. Thank you! #NetNeutrality -bo"

Emwazi was was born in 1988, making him 26 or 27 years old, the BBC reported.

An activist group he communicated with before allegedly going to Syria said that Emwazi was born in Kuwait but moved to England when he was 6 years old.

The neighborhood is considered to be working class.

Neighbors told ABC News that Emwazi's relatives have not been seen at their home in the past week.

""If these allegations are true, we are shocked and sickened by the news,"" a spokesman for the university said in a statement.

Matt Olsen, former director of the National Counterterrorism Center and current ABC News consultant, said Emwazi's background points to a disturbing wrinkle.

""The identification of this individual, if it turns out that it is in fact confirmed, really just underscores the concern that ISIS has the ability to reach into London and recruit somebody who's well-educated and comes from a middle-class family,"" he said. ""That's a real concern for everyone in the counter-terrorism community.""

CAGE describes itself as an ""advocacy organisation"" that regularly works on behalf of Guantanamo Bay detainees and Muslims who have been detained for terrorism. Their employee, Asim Qureshi, spoke today about how he communicated with Emwazi repeatedly between 2010 and 2012, when he is believed to have gone to Syria.

Qureshi described Emwazi as a ""beautiful young man"" when they met in the summer of 2009 to discuss Emwazi’s complaints about being detained and harassed by British authorities as he traveled.

He said he cannot confirm that the man in the ""Jihadi John"" video is Emwazi because his face is covered, but added that the personality is very different from the one he knew in London. He described Emwazi as kind, gentle and soft spoken.

He said Emwazi told him he didn't ""want to live in a country where I’m treated as the enemy.""

""What happened to him after then? I can’t tell you. I don’t know myself,"" Qureshi said.

He spoke English with a British accent in the video, hence his nickname, ""Jihadi John.""

Though he always appeared covered, his voice and stature led experts to believe that he was also the figure pictured in at least six other videos showing the deaths of Steven Sotloff, David Haines, Alan Henning, Peter Kassig, Kenji Goto Jogo and Haruna Yakuawa.

A spokesperson for Prime Minister David Cameron said that he ""would be concerned about information being put into the public domain at any time that might jeopardize ongoing police or security investigations or the safety of British citizens.""

“The Sotloff family was confident law enforcement would find him out and bring him to justice and they have full confidence the U.S. government will be able to do that,” the statement said. “The family would like to see him brought to a court in N.Y. or eastern Va. and watch him prosecuted for the beheading of their son and convicted to life in a super max facility. This is how justice is served in this country.”

""I think all the families will feel closure and relief once there’s a bullet between his eyes,"" she told ITV."

A job posting to man the ""Penguin Post Office"" in Port Lockroy, Antarctica, has received a record number of applicants: more than 1,500 since Feb. 16. In 2014, there were only 82 applicants all year long.

United Kingdom Antarctic Heritage Trust (UKAHT) is looking for four people to, in addition to taking care of the 70,000 cards posted each year for delivery to 100 countries, monitor the impact of the approximately 18,000 visitors to Port Lockroy, situated on Goudier Island in the Antarctic Peninsula, on the wildlife, plus record the number of visitors and ships visiting the area.

One reason for the increase in applications, the organization said, was the airing of the documentary ""Penguin Post Office"" on BBC2 in the U.K. in July 2014 and on PBS in the U.S. in January 2015.

Each year, the UKAHT’s U.K. team -- based in Cambridge -- searches for committed individuals to make up a small team of four to spend five months at its flagship site, Port Lockroy, situated on Goudier Island in the Antarctic Peninsula. The job runs from November 2015 to mid-March and pay is $1,700 per month.

Job Description:

""The team chosen to spend the 2015/16 season at Port Lockroy will assist the Base Leader in the efficient running of the post office, maintenance and museum operation, with areas of responsibility being divided up amongst team members. A can-do attitude is vital as is good physical fitness, co-ordination (carrying heavy boxes over slippery rocks and slushy snow whilst dodging the local gentoo penguin population is a frequent requirement), environmental awareness and a practical knowledge of minimum impact living. Above all successful candidates need to be passionate about the Antarctic.""

No post office experience is necessary and applicants need not be British citizens.

Amy Kincaid, a member of the current team, said applicants need to be ""realistic."" She called the living quarters (pictured) ""surprisingly cozy,"" though added that ""being confined to an island the size of a football pitch isn’t for everyone.""

Interested applicants can apply here. Deadline is midnight Friday."
1DVB4wY,2015-03-05 00:00:00,The World of Intersex Children and One Person's Journey Between Two Sexes - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Health/world-intersex-children-persons-journey-sexes/story?id=28667285,"Growing up in a small town near Barahona, Dominican Republic, southwest of the island home to pristine beaches not yet sullied by the outside world, I heard stories about children nicknamed ""guevedoces.""

The town is called Salinas and if you ask anyone in the country about Salinas -- the one close to Barahona because there are four -- you will hear two tales: One is how some of the people there were born with a rare condition that made their feet look like lobster feet. And the other tale is of how a number of children were presumably born as girls and later turned into boys once they hit puberty. They were called guevedoces, or “penis at 12.”

To the best of the villagers’ knowledge they looked like girls at birth and were raised that way. But as they got older, their voices deepened and it was discovered they had testicles, eventually turning into adult men. Doctors from Cornell University in upstate New York traveled there to study some of the children with this medical anomaly, even bringing some of them back to the states for research.

I traveled the rural roads of Dominican Republic in search of the mystery town.

Upon my arrival, I saw a group of people sitting in the shade of a tree. And they were not surprised that a Dominican-American journalist was asking about the guevedoces.

One of them was barefoot man and his foot looked like a lobster -- making at least one of the tales I had heard true.

Back in Salinas, I was hoping to interview one of the guevedoces. I was told that when doctors took some of them to the U.S. for research, most of them used it as an opportunity to stay -- never returning to Salinas.

The women in the group were more eager to talk than the men. Maria Felis remembers vividly when doctors from the United States came to the town taking some of guevedoces to New York.

“There aren’t so many now as there were before,” ahe explained. “I remember when the last two brothers left in 1989. They never told us why there were so many children born that way.”

“There was a baby born like the guevedoces last year,” Maria added, “but the mother would be too embarrassed to talk.”

I was very familiar with this response. I have come across numerous parents in the United States with intersex children and most of them felt the same way.

“It’s an important story and I want to help,” one mother told me, “but I am worried what people will think of my child.”

Another woman, Josefa Cuevos, recalled one of her childhood friends. “I remember when one was born… then she grew up changed her name and started to live as a man.”

In today’s terminology the guevedoces are intersex, and it’s a condition that affects American children as well.

About one in every 2,000 babies are born intersex each year in the United States alone, according to the National Institutes of Health, but they don’t always stay that way forever. Many undergo gender assignment surgery to assign them one gender over the other.

In our upcoming ""Nightline"" report, we follow the journey of Saifa Wall, who was born with ambiguous genitalia like the guevedoces. But instead of letting him grow into his sex, doctors assigned him female at birth and removed his testicles at the age of 13.

For the first time, Saifa, who is now 35 years old, came face-to-face with the pediatric surgeon, Dr. Terry Hensle, who performed his gender assignment surgery almost 20 years ago at Saifa’s parents’ request, deciding his sex with Saifa's mother's consent, which Saifa says was the wrong gender for him."

The family-friendly breed of dogs is atop the American Kennel Club’s list of the Most Popular Dogs in the U.S., for the 24th consecutive year.

“The Lab truly is America’s dog,” AKC Vice President Gina DiNardo said in a statement.

The AKC’s 2014 list, released today, shows German shepherds, golden retrievers, bulldogs and beagles following Labrador retrievers in the top five.

The beagle, which ranked number five on the AKC list, saw its breed get attention earlier this year when a Beagle named Miss P, from British Columbia, took home the top Best in Show honor at the Westminster Kennel Club Show earlier this month.

The AKC's most popular list is derived from the number of dogs within each breed registered with the club, an AKC spokeswoman told ABC News.

The bulldog moved up one spot, into number four, above the beagle, on this year's list. The AKC attributes the bulldogs' rise to the breeds’, “natural tendency to form strong bonds with kids, an easy-to-care-for coat and minimal exercise needs. “

A more specific type of Bulldog, the French bulldog, moved into the top 10, at number nine, this year for the first time in nearly 100 years, according to the AKC.

The Labrador retriever’s spot atop the Most Popular Breeds’ list continues its streak as the longest reign in AKC history.

Here is the full top 10 list of the 2014 Most Popular Dogs in the U.S.

1. Labrador Retriever

2. German Shepherd Dog

3. Golden Retriever

4. Bulldog

5. Beagle

6. Yorkshire Terrier

7. Poodle

Video of Wednesday’s epic brawl in Turkey’s parliament has emerged today, showing at least five lawmakers sustaining injuries.

At least two legislators were hit with what appears to be a fairly hefty gavel, two were hospitalized and three others treated in the building’s medical office.

The scuffles broke out during a debate about a new security bill that would give police more power to break up demonstrations, and notably give governors, not just prosecutors and judges the right to order arrests.

Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the bill was ""aimed at protecting social order and social peace.” But critics say the bill violates civil liberties and Erdogan is simply trying to curb escalating protests threatening his party.

Located 12.8 billion light-years from Earth, astronomers discovered the behemoth black hole inside of a quasar that shines 420 trillion times brighter than the sun, according to an article published Wednesday in the journal ""Nature.""

The quasar is so bright, scientists say, because of the radiation emitted as matter is accelerated and sucked into the massive black hole.

The ancient quasar was believed to have been shining brightly when the universe was less than a billion years old. With the universe now dated at 13.8 billion years old, the quasar is shining much brighter and is extraordinarily bigger than what scientists would have expected for the ancient body.

There are 40 known quasars that date back to the first one billion years after the Big Bang, according to scientists, with each having a black hole with the mass of one billion suns. By comparison, the newly discovered quasar, called SDSS J0100+2802, is a giant among giants.

The sheer size of the black hole has posed a new question about how something so massive was able to form at the dawn of time.

""How can a quasar so luminous, and a black hole so massive, form so early in the history of the universe, at an era soon after the earliest stars and galaxies have just emerged?"" Xiaohui Fan, a professor astronomy at the University of Arizona and co-author of the study, said in a statement. ""And what is the relationship between this monster black hole and its surrounding environment, including its host galaxy?""

It's another mystery of the universe that astronomers will continue to ponder."

The charges, which carry the death penalty, are in connection with the 2000 murder of his friend, Susan Berman, in Los Angeles.

""Prosecutors have been working closely with the Los Angeles Police Department for the past two years investigating the cold case murder. Durst is charged with murdering Berman on or about Dec. 23, 2000. Her body was discovered in her Benedict Canyon home on Christmas Eve,"" the DA said in a statement.

Durst was arrested at a Marriott hotel in New Orleans over the weekend. Louisiana State Trooper Melissa Matey confirmed to ABC News tonight that an arrest warrant was issued for Durst and he was rebooked in the Orleans Parish Jail under two new charges: convicted felon in possession of a firearm, and possession of a weapon with a controlled dangerous substance, which was a small amount of marijuana.

Israelis were voting in parliament elections Tuesday after a heated campaign that focused on economic issues.

Polls opened at 7 a.m. in Jerusalem and the first exit polls will emerge at 10 p.m. local time. Up to 5,881,696 voters will cast ballots at 10,372 polling stations for the Knesset, the legislative body of the Israeli government. In 2013, 67.8 percent of eligible voters cast ballots.

Saying “most good things come to an end,” Britain’s Prince Harry said he will leave the armed forces, calling the move a “really tough decision” and adding that he’s looking forward to a new chapter in his life.

In a statement released today, Harry – who is known as Captain Wales in the military – said he considered himself incredibly lucky to have had the chance to do “some very challenging jobs” and met “many fantastic people in the process.”

“From learning the hard way to stay onside with my Colour Sergeant at Sandhurst, to the incredible people I served with during two tours in Afghanistan - the experiences I have had over the last 10 years will stay with me for the rest of my life. For that I will always be hugely grateful,” Harry said.

San Francisco 49ers linebacker Chris Borland, 24, retired because of concerns about the effects of repetitive head trauma, he told ESPN's ""Outside the Lines"" on Monday.

Borland, one of the NFL's top rookies last season, said he made his decision after talking with family members, concussion researchers, friends, and current and former teammates.

""I just honestly want to do what's best for my health,"" Borland told ""Outside the Lines."" ""From what I've researched and what I've experienced, I don't think it's worth the risk.""

Sony today unveiled the latest prototype of its Project Morpheus gaming headset and revealed that consumers could strap on the device as early as the first half of next year.

While the virtual reality headset looks similar to the first prototype shown off last year, it's packed with new technological improvements that will give wearers a better experience.

Sony traded out its 5-inch LCD for a 5.7-inch OLED display, which allows the wearer's field of vision to expand, the company said on its PlayStation blog.

The new display is twice as fast as the first prototype, packing smoother visuals that allow wearers to feel as though they are in a virtual world and responding to wearers’ movements in half the time.

The lag time between when wearers move their head and when their movement is reflected on the screen has been shaved down to 18 milliseconds, according to Sony.

Other changes include three more LEDs on the front and sides of the headset, enabling better 360-degree tracking.

As with many virtual reality headsets, taking it off can be a production. The latest prototype is lighter and comes with a quick-release button for when gamers decide they've had enough of the virtual world, Sony said."

Sylvan not only complains that K-Cups, which are found in many households and offices around the country, contribute to waste, but that they're expensive, too.

“I feel bad sometimes that I ever did it,"" Sylvan told The Atlantic.

“I don't have one. They're kind of expensive to use,” Sylvan said about the coffee pods experience. “Plus it’s not like drip coffee is tough to make.”

Sylvan did not respond to a request for comment from ABC News.

In the article, Monique Oxender, the chief sustainability officer for Keurig Green Mountain, said the pods are ""fully recyclable"" if a person is willing to disassemble them into paper, plastic and metal parts.

“I gotta be honest with you,” Oxender said, “we're not happy with where we are either. We have to get a solution, and we have to get it in place quickly.”

But Sylvan counters that the type of plastic creates a recycling challenge.

“No matter what they say about recycling, those things will never be recyclable,” Sylvan said. “The plastic is a specialized plastic made of four different layers.""

Sylvan said he has proposed a solution that's so far fallen on deaf ears.

""Take coffee and put it in a centrifuge, and it comes apart. Then you take the parts and combine them back when you make the coffee. So you could use something like a ketchup foil pack, and the separate parts won't become oxidized when they’re stored and transported. Then you can combine them again at the last minute while making the coffee,” he told The Atlantic.

A spokeswoman for Keurig said the recyclability of K-cup packs “is a challenge we take very seriously.”

“[Sylvan’s] contributions to the company were made in its infancy 19 years ago and Keurig Green Mountain is a fundamentally different company today, in which we partner with the world’s leading brands and are committed to sustainability,” a statement from the company read.

Keurig said it is working toward making all of its K-Cup packs recyclable by 2020, in addition to other environmental goals like limiting water use, according to the company’s sustainability report released last month. Keurig says the majority of pack types for the Keurig 2.0 system will be recyclable by mid-March. The company’s other goals include achieving “zero waste-to-landfill” at its manufacturing and distribution facilities.

The company says it has also studied packaging for its Keurig 2.0 brewers to avoid using 16 million cubic feet of EPS foam each year, enough to fill a football field to a depth of 283 feet.

The company said it supports more effective municipal recycling and has joined other companies in the Closed Loop Fund to make recycling available to all Americans."
1DVsqxD,2015-02-09 00:00:00,Mother Turned In Son Because He Allegedly Wants to Become a Serial Killer - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/US/mother-turned-son-allegedly-serial-killer/story?id=28837259,"A concerned mother has turned her son in to police because she believed he wanted to become a serial killer, according to prosecutors. The son has now talked publicly about the voices in his head during a jailhouse interview.

Police say Daniel Spain was wanted as a suspect in a stabbing that took place in Spokane, Washington, on Thursday. After seeing surveillance footage released in connection to that stabbing, Spain's mother drove her son to the police station because she recognized him in the footage.

Spain, 25, spoke to ABC affiliate KYLY-TV from behind bars and talked about how he believes he has a multiple personality disorder and that only part of him has violent urges.

""I became aware of another personality in me that wanted to hurt people because they hurt me,"" he said during the interview.

""She [the alleged victim] thought the other me was going beat her up or something like that, not stab her, because I wouldn't allow that had I known that. Neither would one of the others I have,"" he said.

Spain told KXLY he had been rejected by women -- though not the woman he allegedly attacked -- in the past and that prompted his rage.

The explanation is reminiscent of the one given by Eliott Rodger, the 22-year-old student in Santa Barbara, California, who said he was enraged before going on a rampage in May 2014, killing six people before turning his gun on himself.

Spain's mother has not publicly disclosed whether he had specifically indicated that he wanted to become a serial killer, but something triggered her to bring him to police as soon as she learned about his connection to the stabbing. His mother had no comment when contacted by ABC News.

""Being able to find someone alone and hurting them without anyone seeing or any witnesses it's kind of really hard,"" Spain said during the KXLY interview.

Spain appeared in court Friday via video link where he was charged with first-degree assault. He did not enter a plea.

Deputy Prosecutor Kyle Treece argued that he should have a high bail set against him because ""his goal is to become a serial killer and this was an action that was meant to further that end.""

""It's come to the attention of the detectives and Mr. Spain's mother that Mr Spain well his goal is to become a serial killer and this was an action that was meant to further that end,” Treece said.

Spain appeared unmoved during Treece's comment, though other defendants behind him who were also waiting to be arraigned appeared to be unsettled by the comment.

The judge set Spain's bond at $100,000 and he remains in the custody of the Spokane County Jail. It’s unclear whether he has a lawyer."

Flight 1074, en route to Denver, returned to Dulles International Airport shortly after takeoff late Monday. The pilots told air traffic controllers the passenger became violent but was restrained by passengers, according to LiveATC.net.

""He ran forward towards the cockpit and he is being restrained by passengers,"" one of the pilots said. ""Cockpit is secure and we would like to return to the airport and have the authorities meet him.""

Donna Tellam, a passenger on board the flight, said two men grabbed him and held him down.

""One held his feet and the other one kind of laid on top of him and then the flight attendants went and got some plastic restraints for his arms,"" she said. “At one point when his head was down he said there were jihadists in the cargo hold and he did say jihad a couple times.""

Law enforcement in Washington met the plane at the gate and detained the passenger, according to a statement from United Airlines. He was taken to a hospital for an evaluation, an airport spokesman said.

United Airlines planned to fly the remaining passengers to Denver this morning."

Would I be happy working for this person?

""I will only hire someone to work directly for me if I would work for that person,"" Zuckerberg told a group in Barcelona who participated in the Facebook co-founder's monthly town hall meeting. ""It's a pretty good test.""

One of those people who passed the test was clearly Facebook's Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg.

When asked by a woman in the audience what it is like to work with Sandberg, Zuckerberg said he considered her a mentor and someone who has been instrumental in building Facebook into a business and ""healthy organization.""

Zuckerberg was in Barcelona for the Mobile World Congress where he spoke about the strides his Internet.org initiative has made in the developing world since he first announced its launch on year ago.

More than 7 million people in developing countries have benefited so far from having Internet access from their phones, according to Zuckerberg. With 50 million people living in the countries that are covered by the app, that number is likely to increase."

In the Dutch town of Eindhoven, more than 32,000 people signed up on Facebook to participate. In Amsterdam, 19,000 registered interest in playing.

“We enjoy the idea,” said Martina Smedberg, a spokeswoman at IKEA Netherlands, “but it’s not very good for health and safety.”

The huge numbers of potential attendees are the main concern for the furniture company. “We need to know how many people are in our store if something happens,” Smedberg told ABC News.

This trend started in Belgium, when a popular local blogger, Elise De Rijck, organized a hide-and-seek event at the Wilrijk store, with the blessing and assistance of IKEA Belgium. The idea, she said, came to her when she decided to write a bucket list of 30 things to do before her 30th birthday.

“Initially, I created a Facebook event for my friends, but thousands of people started joining,” said De Rijck, who hid in the store while her friends tried to find her, later adding: “IKEA contacted me and said they wanted to help me organize the event. They had to spend money hiring extra staff and security, but it brought them a lot of attention.”

A spokeswoman from Ikea Belgium, Annelies Nauwelaerts, said the event went really well. “We wanted to make her dream come true –and clearly the dream of thousands of others—but it was an exclusive, one-off thing.”

IKEA Netherlands has reached out on Facebook to the organizers and asked them to consider the security and safety risks. “Ninety-nine percent of them understood,” Smedberg said.

For the enthusiastic, the aim is now to find another venue."

Clostridium difficile, or C. Diff, is a bacterial infection that leads to inflammation of the colon, the agency explained. The bacterium is found in feces, the agency said, and is spread by hand contact or contaminated surfaces.

More than 80 percent of C. Diff deaths were people 65 or older, with residents of nursing homes especially vulnerable to infection, the report said.

“C. difficile infections cause immense suffering and death for thousands of Americans each year,” CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden said.

Hospital stays and especially long-term antibiotic use seem to up the risk of C. Diff infection.

“Antibiotics kill off beneficial bacteria in the gut which fight infection, leaving space for C. Diff to come in and release its toxins,” explained Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert with Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville, Tennessee.

Studies show that more than half of patients receive antibiotics at some point in their stay, and up to 50 percent of antibiotic use is unnecessary. Over-prescribing antibiotics, combined with poor infection control, may allow the spread of C. diff and other bacteria within a facility and to other facilities when a sick patient is transferred, the CDC report speculated.

The CDC report said preventing and controlling C. Diff should be a national priority. The infection costs up to $4.8 billion each year in excess health care costs, the agency reported.

“You can fight it with hand hygiene, early diagnosis, isolating sick patients and curtailing excessive antibiotic use,” Schaffner said.

Meticulously cleaning surgical instruments would also help, Schaffner noted. Seven people were diagnosed last week with another drug-resistant ""super bug"" known as CRE at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center after undergoing endoscopy procedures with instruments that may have been contaminated."

Three suspects allegedly stole $4.8 million-worth of gold after one of the two armed guards -- the driver and another man, both inside the truck's cabin -- said that he felt sick and prompted the driver to pull over, Wilson County Sheriff Calvin Woodard Jr. told reporters today.

That account is different from what was presented in the first police report on the case, which said that a mechanical issue caused the truck's driver to pull over.

“There is suspicion at this time that this could be an inside job due to the circumstances of the robbery,"" a Wilson County Sheriff’s Office detective wrote in a search warrant application to get access to one of the guards' cell phones, one of two search warrants in the case obtained today.

""The fact that the truck was robbed immediately upon it pulling over at an unannounced stop is suspicious in and of itself,"" the document added. ""It is also suspicious because there are no markings on the side of the truck that would indicate the type of cargo contained therein. The suspects also went directly to the trailer and found the gold which was in unmarked five gallon buckets. It is not believed that this is a random act due to the nature and facts of this robbery.""

The second search warrant application was to get access to the truck and the trailer it was pulling.

Woodard told reporters today that the case was ""suspicious,"" but declined to reiterate the theory expressed in the search warrant that the robbery could have been an inside job.

Woodard shared sketches of the three suspects who allegedly bound the hands of the driver and the passenger, and a photo of a traffic cone that was placed behind the truck as the suspects allegedly removed the gold from the vehicle after breaking a lock on the back. The traffic cone had the marking of a company that only does work in Florida.

The truck was bringing gold and silver to Bridgewater, Massachusetts, and being driven on I-95 by armed guards employed by a Miami-based company, TransValue Inc., Woodard said.

One of the search warrants states that approximately $5 million-worth of silver was left in the truck, meaning that when the truck left Miami on Sunday morning, it had close to $10 million in metals inside the back compartment, which, the sheriff said, was protected solely by a Master lock on the door.

""The suspects attempted to steal the truck and trailer but could not get the truck started,"" according to one of the search warrants. ""The truck was in proper working condition so the suspects had to [have] not been experienced in the operation of a commercial motor vehicle. The suspects loaded the gold in the minivan and fled the scene.""

The metal was owned by Republic Metals Corporation in Opalocka, Florida, according to a search warrant. The company did not immediately respond to a call seeking comment.

The police said they were seeking a search warrant for the phones of the armed guard who felt sick because of the suspicious nature of the case, but Woodard said at today's news conference that the driver and the passenger have not been considered suspects. Both men have been interviewed separately several times by police, Woodard added.

Woodard noted that the driver and the passenger apparently violated their company’s policies by exiting the vehicle without their firearms and leaving the firearms inside the truck."

In an announcement today, McDonald's said it will only source ""chicken raised without antibiotics that are important to human medicine.""

Gail Hansen, senior officer of the antibiotic resistance project at The Pew Charitable Trusts, said, “McDonald’s announcement is a big public health victory in the battle against antibiotic resistance.""

Hansen, a former state epidemiologist and state public health veterinarian for the Kansas Department of Health and Environment, and her colleagues have worked on phasing out the overuse of antibiotics in food production. Some health experts say the overuse of antibiotics in meat can contribute to the public health threat of ""superbugs.""

Many chicken producers use antibiotics to increase the rate of growth of their animals or to counter the effects of poor diets and unhealthy conditions, according to Keep Antibiotics Working senior analyst Steven Roach. The Natural Resources Defense Council and Keep Antibiotics Working are among the groups that have encouraged McDonald's to make this step over the last several years.

McDonald's U.S. restaurants will also offer customers milk from cows that are not treated with rbST, an artificial growth hormone.

""Our customers want food that they feel great about eating -- all the way from the farm to the restaurant -- and these moves take a step toward better delivering on those expectations,"" said McDonald's U.S President Mike Andres.

Jonathan Kaplan, director of NRDC's food and agriculture program, points out that McDonald's ""Global Vision"" statement doesn't include a ban on the use of all medically-important antibiotics in routine disease prevention, which some say can contribute to antibiotic resistance.

""Hopefully, chicken is just the start - the Big Mac and McRib may be next,"" Kaplan said, adding that he hopes McDonald's closes this ""loophole"" and applies their new U.S. chicken antibiotics curbs to all their restaurants globally.

In late 2013, the FDA announced a plan to phase out antibiotics in feed for growth promotion to prevent antibiotic resistance. But the announcement indicated farmers could still claim antibiotics were being used for illness prevention.

Rep. Louise Slaughter, D-NY, who has worked to “save antibiotics” and is the sole microbiologist in Congress, has previously proposed removing antibiotics from farms.

“Today’s announcement from McDonalds is encouraging, but until there is an enforceable, verifiable limit on agricultural antibiotic use, we will have no way to verify whether chicken raised on medically important antibiotics has been truly phased out,"" she said in a statement. ""Furthermore, I have called on McDonald’s to also phase out beef raised on medically important antibiotics, and I will continue to press them on that front.""

When asked if the company has similar plans for its beef supply, a spokeswoman for McDonald's said in a statement to ABC News, ""We continue to look at our menu and how we can evolve it based on what our customers tell us is important to them. We are proud of these initial steps we have announced today related to chicken and will be doing more going forward.""

As part of the company announcement today, McDonald’s USA was announced as a founding member of the newly formed U.S. Roundtable on Sustainable Beef, which includes organizations like Cargill, Walmart, World Wildlife Fund and The Nature Conservancy."

But a State Department spokesperson told ABC News it will be ""several months"" before the emails are released, because the department will need time to review the emails and remove sensitive and personal information.

“I want the public to see my email. I asked State to release them. They said they will review them for release as soon as possible,” Clinton wrote on Twitter Wednesday night..

State Department deputy spokeswoman Marie Harf, in a statement that followed Clinton's tweet, said the department is focused on reviewing Clinton's emails.

""The State Department will review for public release the emails provided by Secretary Clinton to the Department, using a normal process that guides such releases,” the statement reads. “We will undertake this review as quickly as possible; given the sheer volume of the document set, this review will take some time to complete.”

Clinton’s team submitted 55,000 pages of emails to the State Department, but an unknown number of emails that do not pertain to work will not be turned over, a Clinton aide told ABC News.

The storage of Clinton’s email has come under scrutiny after a New York Times report revealed she used a personal, non-governmental email address to conduct official business as secretary of state. The Associated Press reported Tuesday Clinton used a personal server based in her New York home to host her emails.

Clinton, 67, used only one email address during her tenure, her attorney David Kendall wrote in an email to the House Select Committee, which is tasked with investigating the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi,Libya. The committee sent subpoenas to the State Department Wednesday requesting all of Clinton's communications related to Libya.

“The Select Committee on Benghazi today issued subpoenas for all communications of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton related to Libya and to the State Department for other individuals who have information pertinent to the investigation,” Jamal Ware, communications director for the committee, wrote in a statement. “The Committee also has issued preservation letters to internet firms informing them of their legal obligation to protect all relevant documents.”

The email account that Clinton used while working at the State Department was hdr22@clintonemail.com and was traced to a server based out of Chappaqua, New York, where she and former President Bill Clinton have a home, ABC News confirmed.

ABC News also learned that another email domain, wjcoffice.com, which used the former president's initials as their descriptor, was also based out of Chappaqua. That domain was registered by an individual called Eric Hoteham, the same name used to register the clintonemail.com domain.

Clinton has yet to explain why she used her own server and personal email, instead of a State Department email address to comply with federal record-keeping requirements.

Police and other officials still have not formally identified the slain 22-year-old believed behind attacks at a free-speech event and a Jewish synagogue that left two people dead and five wounded.

There are no signs the gunman was part of a wider terror cell, Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt said, despite the arrests of two alleged accomplices. However, Thorning-Schmidt added, according to The Associated Press, the attacks appeared to be terrorism based upon the targets.

""We have no indication at this stage that he was part of a cell,"" she said. ""But we will of course in the coming time evaluate our fight against radicalization. We are already doing a lot.""

The suspected gunman had a history of violence and may have been inspired by Islamic terrorists -- and possibly by the Charlie Hebdo massacre in Paris, police said.

Danish police on Sunday also arrested two men suspected of helping the person blamed for the attacks, they said in a statement.

The two alleged accomplices were arraigned today and ordered jailed at a custody hearing held behind closed doors. Michael Juul Eriksen, the defense attorney for one of the two suspects and the man who identified El-Hussein to ABC News, told public broadcaster DR that the two were accused of giving the gunman shelter and getting rid of a weapon.

Police said they were searching for people who witnessed the first shooting, which occurred Saturday at a cultural center hosting a seminar on free speech attended by an artist who had depicted the Prophet Muhammad. Documentary filmmaker Finn Noergaard, 55, was killed in that attack.

Shots were later fired near a synagogue, with a civilian security guard killed, police said. He was identified as Dan Uzan, 37.

Hours later, a gunman -- believed by police to be the same man who launched the earlier attacks -- was killed in a gun battle with a SWAT team.

Police added that the suspected gunman went to an Internet café between the two attacks, though they did not divulge what he did during his time there.

A survivor of Saturday’s attack at the Copenhagen café credited security guards with helping to contain the situation.

When the gunfire started, Helle Merete Brix said, the Swedish state security guards and Danish intelligence officers there ""reacted very quickly.""

""They were in the lobby and, if they hadn't shot back, he could have shot his way through and something like Charlie Hebdo could have happened,"" she said, referring to the attack on the office of the satirical Paris newspaper last month in which 12 people were killed.

Lisa Avila, 36, of Anaheim, California, was 12 weeks pregnant when she woke up on Valentine's Day with severe pain in her abdomen, her aunt, Jessica Jule, said at a news conference Tuesday. Doctors at Anaheim Regional Medical Center's emergency room did an ultrasound, said her baby was fine and sent her away with a prescription for painkillers, Jule said.

The ectopic pregnancy ruptured, causing her to bleed internally, the aunt said.

""She needed emergency surgery to stop the bleeding,"" Jule said at the news conference outside the hospital.

The next day, Avila, who has seven other children, slipped into a coma, Jule said.

""Why did they make my niece leave this hospital when obviously there was something wrong?"" Jule said. ""How could they say the baby was fine if it was an ectopic pregnancy and you did an ultrasound?""

Avila's family, including Jule, could not be reached by ABC News for comment.

Anaheim Regional Medical Center released the following statement:

""Patient safety is Anaheim Regional Medical Center’s foremost priority and we are committed to providing the highest quality care to every patient we serve. The physicians, nurses and staff at Anaheim Regional Medical Center care deeply for the health of this patient and our thoughts and prayers go out to her and her family. Patient privacy laws prevent us from sharing any additional information.""

Ectopic pregnancies are relatively common and occur in about 1 percent of all pregnancies, said Dr. Marjorie Greenfield, chief of general obstetrics and gynecology at UH Case Medical Center in Cleveland, Ohio. As a result, hospitals have experience spotting and treating them, she said.

""Some of them are very easy to diagnose, and they get diagnosed every day in the emergency room,"" she said, explaining that if a woman has a positive pregnancy test, but a doctor can't spot the embryo in the ""frame"" of her uterus on an ultrasound, that's usually enough to diagnose an ectopic pregnancy.

But sometimes a doctor can't spot an ectopic pregnancy until he or she operates, said Dr. Keith Eddleman, director of obstetrics at The Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan.

""If you have a patient in the first trimester with abdominal pain and bleeding and you can't see the pregnancy inside the uterus -- and you have a positive pregnancy test -- you have to assume it's ectopic until proven otherwise because it is life-threatening,"" Eddleman said.

Although most ectopic pregnancies develop in the fallopian tubes, they can also develop on the ovary or elsewhere in the abdomen, but it's extremely rare, said Dr. Jennifer Ashton ,a senior medical contributor for ABC News and practicing obstetrician-gynecologist. Another rare possibility that would make an ectopic pregnancy harder to diagnose would be something called a heterotopic pregnancy, or when one embryo starts developing in the uterus and another starts developing in the fallopian tube.

Ectopic pregnancies usually rupture at about five or six weeks, when the fallopian tube can't stretch to hold the developing embryo as it grows, so a 12-week ectopic pregnancy is unusual, Greenfield said.

""Ruptured ectopic pregnancy is the number one cause of maternal mortality in the first trimester,"" Ashton said. ""If it ruptures, women can lose liters of blood very quickly.""

Signs include pelvic pain on one side, dark red vaginal bleeding and a positive pregnancy test, Ashton said. Because they ultimately lead to life-threatening miscarriages, treatment for ectopic pregnancy is usually surgery or medication to end the pregnancy.

None of these doctors has treated Avila."

Sylvan not only complains that K-Cups, which are found in many households and offices around the country, contribute to waste, but that they're expensive, too.

“I feel bad sometimes that I ever did it,"" Sylvan told The Atlantic.

“I don't have one. They're kind of expensive to use,” Sylvan said about the coffee pods experience. “Plus it’s not like drip coffee is tough to make.”

Sylvan did not respond to a request for comment from ABC News.

In the article, Monique Oxender, the chief sustainability officer for Keurig Green Mountain, said the pods are ""fully recyclable"" if a person is willing to disassemble them into paper, plastic and metal parts.

“I gotta be honest with you,” Oxender said, “we're not happy with where we are either. We have to get a solution, and we have to get it in place quickly.”

But Sylvan counters that the type of plastic creates a recycling challenge.

“No matter what they say about recycling, those things will never be recyclable,” Sylvan said. “The plastic is a specialized plastic made of four different layers.""

Sylvan said he has proposed a solution that's so far fallen on deaf ears.

""Take coffee and put it in a centrifuge, and it comes apart. Then you take the parts and combine them back when you make the coffee. So you could use something like a ketchup foil pack, and the separate parts won't become oxidized when they’re stored and transported. Then you can combine them again at the last minute while making the coffee,” he told The Atlantic.

A spokeswoman for Keurig said the recyclability of K-cup packs “is a challenge we take very seriously.”

“[Sylvan’s] contributions to the company were made in its infancy 19 years ago and Keurig Green Mountain is a fundamentally different company today, in which we partner with the world’s leading brands and are committed to sustainability,” a statement from the company read.

Keurig said it is working toward making all of its K-Cup packs recyclable by 2020, in addition to other environmental goals like limiting water use, according to the company’s sustainability report released last month. Keurig says the majority of pack types for the Keurig 2.0 system will be recyclable by mid-March. The company’s other goals include achieving “zero waste-to-landfill” at its manufacturing and distribution facilities.

The company says it has also studied packaging for its Keurig 2.0 brewers to avoid using 16 million cubic feet of EPS foam each year, enough to fill a football field to a depth of 283 feet.

The company said it supports more effective municipal recycling and has joined other companies in the Closed Loop Fund to make recycling available to all Americans."

More than 50 jackrabbits the size of small dogs have been hopping around backyards and a park of a new development in South Fargo, resident Kayla Straabe told ABC News today.

""Every day, I feel like the crazy rabbit lady chasing them out of the yard where they're having a hay day,"" Straabe said. ""There's at least 40 to 50 everyday, and they're in our yards and by a children's park.""

She said the city pest control department told her that they couldn't do anything about the jackrabbits, technically wild hares, because they were wild animals.

""I was told we should poison them, which I will absolutely not do,"" Straabe said.

There is no city ordinance that deals with depopulating rabbits in the area, Fargo Police Lt. Joel Vettel told ABC News.

""I can't imagine someone would suggest poisoning the rabbits, but it's true we don't have anything in place to allow us to deal with the rabbits,"" Vettel said. ""What residents can do is start a formal process to get an ordinance, which is usually done at committee meetings.""

Straabe said the critters were cute at first when a few appeared about two to three months ago. But now, they're frustrating, she said, noting they've multiplied and that they are now leaving their droppings everywhere and devouring trees and shrubs.

Female jackrabbits can bear two to four litters each year with one to nine offspring in each litter, according to the Northern Prairie Wildlife Research Center."

He got a call from the hospital where his 2-year-old daughter Maggie just finished a round of chemotherapy telling him that Maggie and her 10-month-old brother Eli were exposed to measles, he told the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, which convened today to discuss the re-emergence of vaccine-preventable diseases.

""My measles-exposed children have been quarantined at home for nearly two weeks now, and we anxiously watch for signs of disease,"" Jacks said, explaining that because of Maggie's compromised immune system, she has to go to the emergency room every time she gets a fever. ""Every warm forehead, every sign of rash, and every runny nose could be the start of measles, and that brings me back to why I am here.""

So Jacks wrote a letter to the parents in the hospital who didn't vaccinate their children and exposed Maggie and Eli to the measles, and he said the letter has been shared 1.3 million times.

""I assume you love your child just like I love mine,"" he wrote to those anonymous parents. ""I assume that you are trying to make good choices regarding their care. Please realize that your child does not live in a bubble. When your child gets sick, other children are exposed. My children. Why would you knowingly expose anyone to your sick unvaccinated child after recently visiting Disneyland? That was a bone-headed move.""

The measles outbreak, which the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say is linked to a group of unvaccinated Disneyland visitors, has now spread to 17 states with 121 confirmed cases, the CDC said Monday.

Because of the exposure, both of Jacks' children had to endure a round of painful antibody shots, and the family had to cancel their winter vacation, which had been planned for the only three weeks Maggie wasn't doing chemo, Jacks said. He said he also feared the complications from measles, which can include pneumonia, swelling of the brain and death.

He urged Congress to promote the importance and safety of vaccinations.

""This issue is close to my heart as a father and pediatrician,"" Jacks concluded. ""With your help, we can put an end to vaccine-preventable illnesses and protect the innocent. We can protect our children."""

""I think the biggest mistake people make is a failure to plan,” said Tom Wheelwright, the CEO and founder of CPA firm Provision.

Wheelwright recommends organizing important documents and considering hiring someone to do your tax paperwork.

""Really, the mistakes of filing are often much more related to paper returns,” said Smith.

Smith adds that taxpayers frequently forget to attach their W2s and other documents when filing by mail.

TurboTax vice president Bob Meighan says one of the easiest ways to avoid mistakes is to simply check the numbers.

""People need to double-check their Social Security number, number one,” Meighan said. ""Number two: check the Social Security number of your dependents, cause we often forget what our children's Social Security numbers are ... because if they're not correct, your return will get rejected.""

Another pro tip: be sure to proofread your tax return for any typos."

“I could not look into his eyes because he wouldn't look at me,” she told ABC News today after testifying Wednesday. “But I tried and I looked him in the face several times and I wanted him to know I was not scared of him.”

She said when she looks at Tsarnaev now, she sees a “coward.” Tsarnaev couldn’t look at her, Gregory said, because she believes he’s unable to “face what he’s really done.”

Gregory lost her left leg in the April 2013 attack that killed three people –- including an eight-year-old boy –- and injured 260 others. Gregory was one of 16 to lose limbs.

Her son, Noah, was sitting at her feet when the bomb went off, but after the explosions, when she tried to help him, she realized she couldn’t get to him.

“I was like, ‘This is it. I’m gone. I can’t even help Noah as a mother. I am completely helpless at this point,'” she said, adding she thought she was going to die that day.

Noah survived with minor injuries.

Gregory said before arriving at court she experienced a flood of emotions, and she reflected back on how fearful she used to be.

“I had been for a very long time. And I didn’t realize I was so fearful, but I truly was and until yesterday, I had this sense of insecurity because of how much I had lost at the finish line that day and I took so much of that back,” she said.

Tsarnaev’s defense said in opening statements they’re not going to contest the fact that their client, along with his late older brother Tamerlan, was responsible for detonating the two bombs that day.

Legal experts told ABC News the defense is likely focusing only on trying to avoid the death penalty for Tsarnaev in the penalty phase of the case."

It wasn't wrecked from bad weather or bulldozed to the ground. The entire building was just not there.

Police eventually found the cabin 3,750 feet away from its original location and now believe they have figured out who took it.

The case appears to involve a complicated ownership agreement regarding the property, a fire at the main house on the land that displaced the people who had lived there, and changing romantic relationships, according to investigators from the Klamath Falls Sheriff's Department.

""Quite frankly, it's one of the most unusual moments I've ever seen,"" Sheriff Frank Skrah said at a news conference Thursday.

The approximately 1,200-square-foot cabin was a secondary building on a larger property that was jointly-owned by three individuals -- two men and a woman.

The man who reported the cabin missing built it and was the only person listed on the home loan, sheriff's officials said. However, the second man allegedly then sold the cabin to a neighbor without the owner's permission, the officials added.

The first man returned to the property on Tuesday for the first time in months to find the log cabin missing and then reported it to police.

Police were able to determine that the neighbor who paid $3,000 for the cabin had no idea it was stolen.

The home was first listed as $10,000, but the buyer was able to haggle down the price, officials said.

""To quote him, 'It was a steal of a deal,'"" a sheriff's department official said at a news conference on Thursday.

The investigation is ongoing and no charges have been filed."

Vandercar, a married 53-year-old father, worked as a senior managing director in the New York office of Mesirow Financial.

""Eric was not only a pillar in our industry, he was a great partner and friend to many. Losing him is a huge loss, personally and professionally,"" the company said in a statement released to ABC News.

The Metropolitan Museum of Art confirmed Liedtke's death, saying that they were ""deeply saddened by this tragic loss.""

""Walter Liedtke was a brilliant, respected curator and scholar of Dutch and Flemish paintings who was part of the Met family for 35 years,"" the statement said. ""He will long be remembered for his vast knowledge, his wit, and a passion for art that inspired all who came in contact with him.""

The mayor of New Castle, New York, identified 42-year-old Joseph Nadol and 36-year-old Robert Dirks as victims in the crash. The fifth victim, 41-year-old Aditya Tomar, was identified by the mayor of Danbury, Connecticut, to ABC News station WABC.

Dirks' employer, D.E. Shaw Research, recalled him as a co-worker, husband and father.

""Robert was a brilliant scientist who made tremendous contributions to our own research, and to the broader scientific community, during his eight years at D. E. Shaw Research,"" the company said in a statement. ""He will be deeply missed as both a colleague and a friend. Our hearts go out to his wife Christine and their children.""

All five of the passengers who died were seated in the first car of the Metro-North train when it crashed into a Mercedes SUV that was on the tracks Tuesday.

The driver of the SUV was also killed in the crash and ensuing explosion. She has been identified as Ellen Brody, a mother of three who worked at a nearby jewelry store.

The National Transportation Safety Board has taken over the investigation into the crash, which was the most fatal in Metro North's history.

The investigation is expected to take nearly a week and crews were seen starting to move the train and SUV from the crash site early this evening.

The Jan. 9 message obtained by ABC News was sent by Howard Attarian, senior vice president of flight operations, and Mike Quiello, vice president of corporate safety. The Wall Street Journal first reported about the message.

Two of the events occurred near the ground, according to the bulletin -- with a pull-up maneuver required in one of the incidents. Another incident involved an “undesired aircraft state on departure,” with the flight crew contributing to a safety lapse.

A fourth incident involved a low fuel state.

“The common thread with all of these is that they are preventable,” the message stated.

A 2013 UPS cargo plane crash in Birmingham, Alabama, which was later blamed on pilot error, was referenced in the message. The plane crashed short of the runway at Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport, killing two crew members.

Pilot retirements, seat movements and new hires were identified in the message as factors that bring added risk to flight operation.

“While no one ever shows up to work with the goal of intentionally making a mistake, we are human and mistakes happen. What we can control is how we conduct ourselves on each and every flight,” the message stated.

United issued a statement to ABC News Wednesday after details of the message were initially reported by the Wall Street Journal. ABC News reached out to the airline early Thursday with calls for further comment, but those efforts were unsuccessful.

“As part of our commitment to safety, we constantly monitor flight operations data and regularly communicate the findings with our pilots,” the statement read. “Our proactive approach to safety aligns with the FAA’s Safety Management System and enables us to recognize potential issues and adjust our actions to further ensure the safety of our customers and coworkers.”

Here is the full memo:

Date: January 9, 2015

SAFETY ALERT: Significant safety concerns

Recent events in our operation have dictated that we communicate with all of you immediately. Over the past few weeks, our airline has experienced what we would categorize as major safety events and near-misses.

In Flight Operations we have seen two events in close proximity to terrain (one resulting in a GPWS pull-up maneuver), an Undesired Aircraft State on departure and a low fuel state on arrival after a deviation from a Sabre Flight Plan routing.

The common thread with all of these is that they are preventable. We must ask ourselves, “Do we have our priorities in line every time we put on our uniforms and strap into the airplane?” While the airline industry always seems to be in a state of flux, the one constant for all of us is that we are professional aviators with the common goal of flying our passengers and crew from point A to point B SAFELY.

Another common thread to some of these events is a lack of attention to disciplined Crew Resource Management. Every time we enter the cockpit with the intention of performing our pilot duties, we evaluate risk. Every pilot must be willing to speak up if safety is in question. In the same vein, every pilot must also accept the input of their fellow crewmembers on the flight deck. In most cases, one of the pilots recognizes an unsafe situation. In some cases, a pilot’s input is ignored. This is unacceptable.

The recent CFIT accident in Birmingham involving another carrier underscores how quickly things can unravel. The approach and landing appeared normal to the pilots until right before impact. Let’s not for a moment think something like that could not happen at United.

We are currently seeing a lot of movement in the pilot group, such as retirements, seat movements and new hires, that -- while welcome -- introduces significant risk to the operation. While no one ever shows up to work with the goal of intentionally making a mistake, we are human and mistakes happen. What we can control is how we conduct ourselves on each and every flight. If you have ever used the term “Standard Brief” before departure, you have not complied with an SOP. If you have ever exceeded Stabilized Approach Criteria intentionally and not executed a go-around, you are not in compliance.

We know this is a brutally honest message and the tendency may be to rationalize why compliance is not occurring in some areas. Bottom line: United is at a critical juncture in its history and we as aviators must adhere to the policies and procedures outlined in the Flight Manuals, FOM, WOM and ALPA Code of Ethics. Reviewing, understanding, and complying with the guidance in company manuals is imperative to returning ourselves, our fellow crewmembers and passengers to their families safely. This is our top priority and greatest responsibility, and we appreciate in advance your continued commitment and cooperation.

Fly safe.

Researchers at Cambridge University in England have taken the first steps towards creating artificial sperm and eggs by reprogramming skin cells from adults and converting them into embryonic-like stem cells. The team then compared the engineered stem cells with human cells from fetuses to confirm they were in fact, identical.

The researchers published their findings in the journal Cell earlier this week, stressing that it’s early days for this type of research.

“We have succeeded in the first and most important step of the process,” Dr. Jacob Hanna, an investigator with the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel, told ABC News.

Hanna said the team will now attempt to complete the process by creating fully developed artificial sperm and eggs, either in a dish or by implanting them in a rodent. Once this is achieved, the technique could become useful for any individual with fertility problems, he said, including couples of the same sex.

""It has already caused interest from gay groups because of the possibility of making egg and sperm cells from parents of the same sex,"" Hanna said.

However, the prospect of creating a baby by these artificial means alone is probably a long way off, Hanna said.

“It is really important to emphasize that while this scenario might be technically possible and feasible, it is remote at this stage and many challenges need to be overcome,” he said. “Further, there are very serious ethical and safety issues to be considered when and if such scenarios become considered in the distant future.”

The research was funded by the Wellcome Trust and the Britain Israel Research and Academic Exchange Partnership."

The chocolate shooter is a cocoa powder catapult that launches two small bumps of cocoa powder into the user’s nostrils.

While it is obvious that creator Dominique Persoone has found himself at the extreme of chocolate obsession, what’s less known are the possible health effects of snorting chocolate; there is no research on the impact to the nose or lungs, although medical experts are far from condoning this indulgence.

However, that has not discouraged Persoone from reportedly selling more than 20,000 kits online. Nor has it stopped a Vancouver, Canada, shop from becoming the first known North American store to offer these cocoa bumps.

Mary Jean Dunsdon has been selling the kits for $109 or $2 per sniff to more than to 100 customers. And so far, she has had no complaints.

“We get some people back who’d like to try it again. Or people that like to try both flavors, but no there’s no addict,” Dunsdon says.

So why are we snorting chocolate? It could be the same reason why we’re willing to plunk down big bucks for artisanal chocolate. The Mast Brothers, Rick and Michael Mast, sell $8 bars made in their chocolate factory in Brooklyn, New York.

“For people that want to take their pleasures to the next level you engage in a company like Mast Brothers,” says co-owner Rick Mast.

And for the Iowa natives the next level means bringing it back to basics. Rick’s brother Michael says they want people to “think of chocolate in the purest sense and not just as a bar with a laundry list of ingredients.”

They do so by sourcing cacao beans from small farms around the world, and bypassing large producers. The brothers use select beans for small batches that have a distinctively different taste from the chocolate bars you find at the grocery store checkout counter. Their chocolate is often referred to as bean-to-bar or craft chocolate. This delicious trend is part of a $330 million premium chocolate category that according to the National Confectioners Association has seen 15 percent growth since 2013.

At the University of Michigan, Dr. Ashley Gearhardt runs a cleverly disguised room that looks like a fast food restaurant, but is actually a science lab where she studies food addictions. Chocolate, she has reported, is consistently ranked as the number one food respondents have trouble putting down.

And her research shows that the culprit for the obsession could be our brains.

“That same brain region is one of those regions that we know is really important in other drug addictions,” Gearhardt says. “This section of the brain is activating and saying you want that you crave that you really should get more of that.”

Which could explain how The Mast Brothers have sold more than a million bars sold around the world and are opening a factory this week in London, England. Rick Mast credits their success to one simple truth about chocolate.

“We said many times chocolate is the most popular food on the earth,” he says. “People start smiling just by hearing the sound of it and they just want to taste it, they crave it, they are addicted to it. It’s everything to a lot of people.”"

Researchers at Cambridge University in England have taken the first steps towards creating artificial sperm and eggs by reprogramming skin cells from adults and converting them into embryonic-like stem cells. The team then compared the engineered stem cells with human cells from fetuses to confirm they were in fact, identical.

The researchers published their findings in the journal Cell earlier this week, stressing that it’s early days for this type of research.

“We have succeeded in the first and most important step of the process,” Dr. Jacob Hanna, an investigator with the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel, told ABC News.

Hanna said the team will now attempt to complete the process by creating fully developed artificial sperm and eggs, either in a dish or by implanting them in a rodent. Once this is achieved, the technique could become useful for any individual with fertility problems, he said, including couples of the same sex.

""It has already caused interest from gay groups because of the possibility of making egg and sperm cells from parents of the same sex,"" Hanna said.

However, the prospect of creating a baby by these artificial means alone is probably a long way off, Hanna said.

“It is really important to emphasize that while this scenario might be technically possible and feasible, it is remote at this stage and many challenges need to be overcome,” he said. “Further, there are very serious ethical and safety issues to be considered when and if such scenarios become considered in the distant future.”

The research was funded by the Wellcome Trust and the Britain Israel Research and Academic Exchange Partnership."

Then, his father, a veteran entrepreneur, and older brother, who had recently finished business school, had an idea: What if they opened business employed mostly by people with autism?

""We wanted to build ... an example big and bold and out there that other companies could go ahead and want to emulate,"" Andrew's brother Tom D'Eri, 25, told ABC News, adding that they wanted to find a business that would educate the community by putting autistic employees in front of the customers.

First, the D'Eris did their research, and determined that unemployment is common among people with autism not because they lack skills but because society views autistic individuals as people to be sympathetic toward rather than valuable people with different skills. About 1 in 68 people has autism spectrum disorder, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

“Typically people with autism are really good at structured tasks, following processes, attention to detail,” Tom D’Eri said in video on YouTube. “So we saw that they’re really important skills that people with autism have that make them, in some case, the best employees you can have.”

They opened the Rising Tide Car Wash in Parkland, Florida, in 2013, and today they employ 35 autistic men and women, D'Eri said.

It was Andrew's first job, and though he didn't like it at first, D'Eri said he started noticing positive changes three weeks later. Andrew, 24, had issues with empathy and trying new things in the past, but when his father offered him a bite of a new food -- his father's chicken and portobello mushroom sandwich -- he tried it and then courteously asked to split it when his dad offered him the whole sandwich.

""There were noticeable differences in his behavior. He was willing to try new things, wanting to empathize more.

And since many autistic people are bullied in high school, he said working at the car wash helped them build confidence.

""They come to us with very little purpose and very little hope for their future,"" D'Eri said in the video. ""But once they start working with us they start getting positive reinforcement of doing a good job, a customer being happy, getting a tip, that really starts to open them up."""

Nemtsov, 55, was shot several times in the back as he walked by a bridge near the Kremlin late Friday night, according to Russia’s Investigative Committee. Russia's top investigate body said in a statement Saturday that it was considering several possible motives, including an attempt to destabilize the country, Islamic extremism, the conflict in Ukraine, and Nemtsov's personal life, according to The Associated Press.

""The president has ordered the leadership of the Investigative Committee, the Interior Ministry and the Federal Security Service to form an investigative group and keep the investigation of this crime under personal control,"" said the spokesman, Dmitry Peskov. ""The Russian president expresses deep condolences to relatives and friends of Boris Nemtsov, who died tragically.""

While police in Russia search for a suspect, Nemstov joins a growing list of Putin's critics who have died or have been killed in recent years:

The Russian journalist and human-rights activist was shot and killed inside her apartment in October 2006. She was a fierce critic of Putin's war in Chechnya.

A court convicted five men of involvement in her murder last year, but Russia's Investigative Committee has not yet determined who ordered the killing.

The former agent for Russia's Federal Security Service was poisoned with a highly toxic radioactive element shortly after he made a series of accusations about secret Russian government involvement in terrorism, and then publicly accused Putin by name of ordering the assassination of Politkovskaya.

He died in November 2006, 21 days after he was poisoned.

British police named two Russian men as the prime suspects but Russia has refused to extradite them.

The accountant and auditor was imprisoned in November 2008 after exposing massive corruption. He was found dead in his cell a year later.

Authorities ruled his death a heart attack, but supporters claimed Magnitsky was beaten to death.

The leading Russian human-rights lawyer had represented Politkovskaya and other anti-Chechen-War dissidents. He was shot to death outside in Kremlin in January 2009.

Also killed in the shooting was Anastasia Baburova, a freelance journalist.

A Russian nationalist extremist was sentenced to life in prison for the killings.

The human-rights activist and documentary filmmaker was abducted and executed in July 2009. She was the first winner of the Anna Politkovskaya Award, given to human rights defender in a conflict zone.

Russian investigators said in 2010 that two brothers who were members of an Islamic militant group killed Estemirova, who headed Memorial group's Chechen branch. Memorial said DNA evidence showed that the two men didn't commit the crime.

The popular Russian actor renounced two awards he had ""received from Putin's hands"" because he was ""ashamed.""

“I've had enough of all this czar-state stuff,"" he wrote in a blog post.

Devotchenko was found dead in his apartment in November 2014. Russian investigators originally told reporters his death ""was of a criminal nature,"" but they later said they found he cut his hand and hit his head after drinking too much, and bled out, according to The Telegraph.

The verdict came after a 19-month-long trial in which Schettino, who had been accused of causing the Jan. 13, 2012 shipwreck near the Italian island of Giglio, was charged with multiple counts of manslaughter and abandoning ship before all 4,200 passengers could be safely evacuated.

As part of the sentence, Schettino will not be allowed to command a ship for five years.

Investigators had harshly criticized Schettino's handling of the crash before and during the trial -- accusing him of bringing the vessel too close to shore when it struck rocks off the Tuscan island, tearing a hole in its side and causing the death of 32 people.

Prosecutors had requested for the maximum sentence of 26 years, but instead got 16 years and one month by the three-judge panel in the city of Grosetto, where the trial took place.

Schettino, 54, did not appear in court as a judge read the verdict.

Lawyers for many of the survivors and victims' families have attached civil suits to the criminal trial as a way to press the court to order Costa Crociere, the Italian cruise company that operated the ship, to pay hefty damages.

The judge did say Schettino and the cruise company had to pay damages and legal fees as part of the guilty, but did not go into specifics.

While insisting Schettino deserves to be convicted, the plaintiffs' lawyers have lamented to the court that no one from the cruise company's upper echelons was put on trial.

Prosecutors had insisted Schettino was a ""reckless idiot"" and asked the judges to convict him and sentence him to 26 years and three months in prison.

Four Concordia crew members and the boat's land-based crisis coordinator were allowed to plea bargain. None is serving prison time.

A Winter Storm Watch was issued by the National Weather Service early Saturday morning for the city of Boston and much of southern New England, including Hartford, Connecticut, and Providence, Rhode Island.

This is in anticipation of another round of snow on the way Sunday evening. Boston has experienced its second snowiest season so far with 102 inches of snow, only 5.6 inches away from the all-time record set during the 1995-1996 season.

Boston has tripled its average snowfall to date so far, and it is also the city's snowiest February on record. The city has also had one of its coldest Februaries on record, with this year likely being Boston's second coldest February.

The ABC Weather Team is currently forecasting 3 to 6 inches of snow for Boston by early Monday morning, which could make this season the city's snowiest.

Snow showers will move into the Northeast on Sunday morning and into the early afternoon. However, by Sunday evening, a steadier and heavier snow will overspread the region, reaching Boston closer to sunset.

A wintry mix and even some rain is expected for locations closer to the coast and farther south, including southern New England, New York City, and areas south of Interstate 80.

The city of Boston is forecast to remain all snow throughout the event; therefore, several inches of snow is expected.

The storm will be clearing out of the Northeast by early Monday morning, with snowing likely over before the morning commute throughout the region. Scattered snow showers will linger across northern New England into Monday afternoon with blustery conditions expected from Pennsylvania to Maine.

Even though temperatures will be near or slightly above the freezing mark for most of the Northeast by Monday afternoon, windy conditions will lead to wind chills values below freezing throughout the day."

And with him, he brought a special token of his appreciation for his host, President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi: a Russian-made Kalashnikov.

Putin gave Sisi an AK rifle. I hope this isn't the weapons deal everyone has anticipated for months

The Russians have been courting the Egyptians on arms sales aggressively since former President Hosni Mubarak’s fall in 2011, and the Egyptians have been eager customers. A preliminary arms deal worth $3.5 billion was reached between the two countries in September, according to the Kremlin, which included MiG-29 fighters and attack helicopters.

Before his arrival, according to the Kremlin, Putin told Egyptian state media, ""The volume of bilateral trade has increased significantly over the past years: in 2014, it has increased by almost half compared to the previous year and amounted to more than $4.5 billion. Clearly, this trend needs to be strengthened.”

He added that Egypt has become one of the most popular vacation destination for Russians and, as the tourism industry at large continues to struggle in Egypt, more than 3 million Russians flocked to Egyptian resorts, nearly 50 percent more than in 2013.

Egypt’s government Press Office said President Sissi personally met Putin at the airport Monday night along with his entourage of high-level ministers and officials. It’s his first visit to Cairo since 2005, although Sissi was spotted twice last year at the Kremlin.

The two had dinner together Monday night and later attended a cultural performance “illustrating Egyptian-Russian relations,” according to the government media office.

In the same interview with state media, Putin described Egypt as Russia's ""old and trusted partner,” adding, ""We have once again affirmed that Russia and Egypt share the same determination to further expand relations of friendship and equal cooperation.”

The city has been eagerly awaiting Putin’s arrival, and posters of the Russian strongman lined Cairo’s streets this week.

Kayla Mueller was captured by ISIS while working to help Syrian refugees on Aug. 4, 2013, and her family has made it clear that they plan to honor her work.

The family released a statement today just after the White House confirmed that Mueller, 25, had died. ISIS claimed that she died as part of a Jordanian air strike, but her cause of death has not been formally verified by intelligence sources.

""Kayla was a compassionate and devoted humanitarian,"" her family said in their statement. ""She dedicated the whole of her young life to helping those in need of freedom, justice, and peace.""

Mueller graduated from Northern Arizona University in 2009 ""after only two and a half years,"" during which time she launched her school's chapters of Amnesty International and STAND, a national student group aimed at putting an end to genocide, her family said.

Between graduation and 2011, she worked in northern India as well as in areas effected by the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. She then returned to the U.S. and worked at an HIV/AIDS clinic during the day while volunteering at a women's shelter at night.

Her next international trip came in December 2011 when she worked as an au pair in France, but even that had a humanitarian element to it as she hoped that her improved language skills would help her to someday work in Africa.

At the same time, Mueller also created a blog where she wrote about different conflicts that she hoped to see resolved, touching on Tibet, Darfur and local environmental issues in Arizona.

She traveled to Turkey in December 2012 to help Syrian refugees, where she was captured by ISIS eight months later.

""We are so proud of the person Kayla was and the work that she did while she was here with us,"" the family said in their statement. ""She lived with purpose, and we will work every day to honor her legacy.""

The family -- Mueller's parents Carl and Marsha Mueller, her brother Eric and his family -- have asked that in lieu of flowers, supporters donate to causes that Mueller believed in.

The Rev. Kathleen Day, the head of United Christian Ministry at Kayla's college, said that she kept track of her while she was overseas via her blog.

""We've taken that long journey with her and we were forced to hold our breath,"" Day said this afternoon.

""She sounds so extraordinary [but] what was so extraordinary about Kayla is she did ordinary things in extraordinary measures,"" she said of Mueller's humanitarian work.

Day said that friends of the family had more detailed updates about Mueller's time in captivity, including the ways that she tried to stay positive in such harrowing circumstances.

""Kayla tried to teach the guards crafts to make origami, peace cranes,"" Day said, adding that she would also try exercising inside her cell and ""standing on her head.""

Her parents and brother did not publicly address the media aside from their statement, but two of her aunts read a joint statement from the rest of Mueller's relatives.

""Kayla has touched the heart of the world. The world grieves with us; the world mourns with us; the world wants to be more like Kayla and if that is her legacy and the footprint she leaves on the world, then that is a wonderful thing,"" her aunt Lori Lyon said as part of the joint statement."

Over the past year, as it has been wreaking havoc in Syria and Iraq and recruiting tens of thousands of fighters from around the world, ISIS has released several videos online showing the man with a distinctly British accent standing beside hostages from the United States and elsewhere as they were being beheaded.

The BBC and Washington Post Thursday identified “Jihadi John” as Mohammed Emwazi, a college graduate with a degree in computer programming who grew up in a part of London described by some as working class. He reportedly left for Syria in 2012 and then joined ISIS.

In the interview with ABC News, Holder refused to confirm those reports, insisting nothing “would be served” by revealing the true identity of the masked man.

“It would cut back any of the operational possibilities we have been considering,” Holder added.

Nevertheless, asked whether he can guarantee “Jihadi John” will face justice, Holder said: “The vow that I can make to the American people, along with our allies, is that we will hold accountable all of the people who have been responsible for these heinous, barbaric acts. ... That is something that we are focused on each and every day.”

President Obama echoed those sentiments, saying the United States is “consistent and we are patient.”

“Eventually, if you hurt an American, you are going to be brought to justice in some fashion,” the president said in an interview Thursday with ABC News’ Seattle affiliate, KOMO-TV. “I’m confident we will get the job done. ... It will take a little bit of time but in the end, this death cult that has developed there ... is a dead end.”"

Nimoy, who played Mr. Spock to Shatner's Captain Kirk on the long-running TV show and in movies, died Friday at the age of 83.

His son Adam told the Associated Press that he died of end-stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

The actor revealed he was struggling with the ailment in 2014, according to the New York Times. Nimoy had been a smoker, which contributed to the ailment, before he gave up the habit years ago.

Shatner tweeted today that he was unable to get back to California in time for the funeral because he was in Florida doing a benefit for the Red Cross.

I feel really awful. Here I am doing charity work and one of my dearest friends is being buried.

""I loved him like a brother,"" Shatner wrote on Facebook. ""We will all miss his humor, his talent, and his capacity to love.""

Though he was best known for playing Spock in ""Star Trek,"" Nimoy also worked in the theater, portraying Tevye in ""Fiddler on the Roof,"" and published poetry and books of photography."

The Seoul district court noted that Cho had treated the flight “as if it was her private plane.”

The Seoul-bound aircraft from John F. Kennedy Airport in New York had been towed 55 feet away from the gate but was returned to drop off Park Chang-Jin, the head steward at the time, upon Cho’s orders.

Cho, the daughter of the airline’s chairman, had raged over the way a stewardess served macadamia nuts in the first class cabin, which she claimed should have been offered in a bowl, not in a bag.

Cho, in custody since Dec. 30, wiped away tears with a tissue as a letter expressing her remorse was read to the court by head judge Oh Seong-woo.

The letter included details about how Cho, one of the richest women in South Korea who regularly flew first class, was adjusting to the basic conditions of her prison and reflecting on her life. “I know my faults and I’m very sorry,” Cho said in her letter.

During the previous trial, Cho admitted to verbal and physical violence throwing a service manual on the floor and pushing one of the female flight attendants with her finger.

But she denied committing physical violence against Park, who had intervened to resolve the confrontation. She then demanded the plane be “stopped” and ordered Park to get off the plane.

“She trampled on my pride and humiliated me. She was yelling like a beast looking for its prey,” Park told the court earlier this month. He also claimed that Cho physically abused him by jabbing his hand with the corner of a service manual, and demanding him to kneel. Cho has denied those claims.

Whether the 55-foot return to the gate should be considered a violation of aircraft safety has been an open debate. But the court sentence clearly reflects widespread public outcry over repeated arrogance with impunity by members of the powerful chaebol family, said Han Sang-hoon, Professor of Law at Yonsei University Law School.

“She deserved to be punished because not only did she alter the flight plans but she abused the staff using her power,” said Kim Kyung-sook, 52.

Details of Cho’s attitude has been at the center of media attention in the past two months ranging from what she wore to initial investigations to how she is coping with daily jail life.

Some believe she might have been a target of a “witch hunt” when public sentiment has been negative towards second and third generation members of high-profile chaebols, who tend to rise the corporate ladder quickly than others, often regardless of merit.

“She simply became a bad example of a bad chaebol member,” said Han.

Months before she was shot and killed, Yusor Mohammad, 21, gave an interview where she talked about growing up Muslim in America and what she learned from her Muslim elementary school teacher.

Mohammad was shot to death Tuesday alongside her husband and sister in her home near the University of North Carolina. The police said their preliminary investigation indicates the murders stemmed from a parking dispute. The Council on American-Islamic Relations has asked law enforcement to consider if the motive was anti-Muslim bias, since all three victims were Muslim.

Today WUNC released an interview with Yusor Mohammad conducted with her former elementary school teacher, Mussarat Jabeen, for the StoryCorps, an oral history project that aims to create an archive of interviews for future generations.

“Growing up in America has been such a blessing and you know although in some ways I do stand out such as the hijab I wear on my head, the head covering,” Mohammad told her teacher in the interview. “There’s still so many ways that I feel so embedded in the fabric that is our culture.”

In the lengthy interview Mohammad and Jabeen talked about the “beauty” of inclusion and tolerance they saw in their community.

“That’s the beautiful thing here is that it doesn’t matter where you come from there’s so many different people from so many different places of different backgrounds and religions,” said Mohammad. “But here we’re all one, one culture.”

Mohammad also recalled an important lesson her Jabeen taught her when she was in the third grade. When she asked for something, Jabeen told her she should not try to take, but instead held her hand out in a giving gesture.

“So give don’t take, be less selfish and giving open, compassionate, caring,” said Mohammad of the lesson.

When Mohammad asked her former teacher what is the one thing Jabeen would tell the world, the teacher answered with “peace.”

“Live in peace…that’s what I would say,” said Jabeen. “Make this world a place where everybody has the right to live and we don’t fight over our differences but learn to accept our differences and learn how we can make this world a better place to live keeping our differences aside and focusing on our similarities.”

In a new interview today on WUNC’s show “The State of Things” Jabeen said she wanted to tell Mohammad’s story to honor her and her husband, who was also a student at Jabeen’s school.

“I keep referring to them as children because they are my children,” Jabeen told WUNC. “I just kept thinking about it 'What can I do?' They are the ones who have taught me to be stronger and I have learned to be stronger just because of their faith in who they are and what they want to contribute to the world.”

The deaths have led to an outpouring of support for a fundraising project started by Mohammad’s husband Deah Barakat. The dental student had aimed to raise $20,000 to help fund clinics for the Syrian American Medical Society. Three days after Barakat’s death the project has raised $246,426, more than 10 times the original goal."

Fiet, 44, was in her bakery's kitchen prepping Valentine’s Day treats on Feb. 4, when, at around 5 p.m., she saw an Amber Alert flash on her cellphone.

Fiet, a mother of two sons, said the alert caught her eye because it indicated the child in danger was in a black SUV. Fiet remembered seeing black SUV parked outside her shop and assumed it was a customer at the framing store next door.

“After I got the message I looked out my door and saw the SUV but there was no license plate on the front,” Fiet, who opened Mini's in 2007, told ABC News. ""I went to the other side and saw the license plate and thought, ‘Oh my hell.’”

Sitting inside the black SUV was the focus of the Amber Alert, 3-year-old Bella Martinez. Bella had been left sleeping inside the car by her father, Pedro Martinez, around 3 p.m., that day while he went into a convenience store located about 25 blocks away from the cupcake shop, according to police.

A woman who approached Martinez for a cigarette at the convenience store got inside his car and drove off with Bella as soon as Martinez was inside the store, Salt Lake South Police Department executive officer Gary Keller told ABC News.

Fiet said when she saw Bella inside the car through an open window, she knew she had to act.

“My initial thought was to call 911 but then I looked closer and saw Bella was in a tremendous amount of stress, hyperventilating and crying,"" Fiet said. ""I just dropped my phone and ran out the door.”

“My thought was just to get her out of the car,” she said. “As I’m diving through the open window I thought, ‘Please don’t shoot me,’ and then I thought, ‘Well if they drive off I’ll be hanging out the window and someone will call 911.’”

Luckily for Fiet and Bella, the suspect, identified by police as 24-year-old Rosealee Maria Key, had already abandoned the SUV.

In a span of what Fiet estimates to be about 30 seconds, she got Bella out of the SUV and safely inside the cupcake shop. Fiet locked the door, only allowing a customer she knew, who was also a nurse, in to help her.

While the customer called 911, Fiet says she read Bella books and gave her a stuffed animal to hold on to.

“I thought about giving her a cupcake but with so many allergies now –- gluten free, dairy free -- I didn’t dare give her any food,” Fiet said.

When a plain-clothed police officer happened to walk by, Fiet let him in, but only after verifying his badge number with the 911 operator.

“He was calling out the number through the window,” she said.

Nearly 45 minutes later, Bella’s parents arrived at Fiet’s store, accompanied by the police chief and their extended family, who had all been out searching for Bella on their own.

“It was a whole lot of thank you’s and hugs,” Fiet said of the meeting. “I don’t think you can even talk at that point.”

“The relief of knowing your child is safe and that nothing has happened to her, what else can you say? You’re just in tears,” she said.

Fiat went home around 8:30 that night and came back to her bakery early the next morning, thinking it would be a normal work day.

“I’m getting lines and lines and I can’t bake and frost fast enough and I’m like, ‘What is going on?,’” Fiet said. “Then someone said, ‘They said what you did on the radio and said to come down and support you.”

So many people came to support Fiet's shop that some of her friends took the day off from their own jobs to help her man the crowds. On Thursday night, a local talk radio show broadcast live from Mini's Cupcakes, keeping the store open well past its usual 6 p.m. closing time.

In addition to the new customers, flowers, cards and thank you notes have been pouring in from complete strangers, according to Fiet.

“People are saying hero which makes me uncomfortable because I don’t feel that way,” she said. “I think of a hero as a firefighter running into a building. I think I have more of an attitude that I’m grateful to have been in a position to be there for Bella..”

One gift that Fiet has not removed from herself is the one given to her by Bella’s father when he and Bella’s family returned to Mini’s Cupcakes on Friday to say thank you again.

“Bella’s parents gave me a beautiful charm necklace with the date of her abduction and angel wings,” Fiet said. “Her dad put it on me and I haven’t taken it off.”

The suspect in the case turned herself into authorities on Feb. 4. She was arrested by police and charged with unauthorized use of a vehicle and child endangerment, authorities told ABC News."
1E5VQZF,2015-02-11 00:00:00,Rosamund Pike Explains Why She Wore That Daring Dress to the Golden Globes - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/rosamund-pike-explains-wore-daring-dress-golden-globes/story?id=28865261,"Every awards season, the Oscars seem to sprinkle fairy dust on a budding actress, launching her to stardom.

And this is Rosamund Pike’s year.

Pike, 36, has grabbed the spotlight for her masterful performance as the icy, mysterious Amy Dunne in “Gone Girl,” a role that earned her an Oscar nod this year.

But she also turned heads, and even raised some eyebrows, recently when she stepped out on the red carpet at the Golden Globes in a stunning backless white gown with severe cuts on the side, just five weeks after giving birth to her second son.

While some questioned her fashion choice, Pike said the real reason she wore such a daring dress was because she didn’t “fit into any of the dresses” she tried on.

“You’ve got to take that knife out and start slashing,” she said, referring to the dress’ unique style.

Pike, it seems, is an overnight sensation 15 years in the making, having taken on smaller roles in other films, such as “Die Another Day” and “Pride and Prejudice.” Famed director David Fincher hand-picked her for the dark, juicy “Gone Girl” role.

“I think there's definitely -- the one's inner psycho can be embraced at all times,” she said, laughing.

In the film, Pike tangles with Neil Patrick Harris, who plays Amy Dunne’s ex Desi Collings, in a harrowing scene that is both gruesome and sexually explicit. Pike said scene required more than 30 takes.

“I think with Neil, I tried to protect his modesty as best I could,” Pike said. “I still remember saying to David, I said, ‘Oh, did I-- you know, did I protect him?’ And he was like, ‘Yes, you were like a little bloody codpiece.’”

She prepared for “Gone Girl” by boxing and getting herself into strong physical shape. In a fight scene with Ben Affleck, who plays the husband Amy Dunne frames, Pike said she hit her head so hard she saw stars, but used it as motivation.

“I think one of the takes that they use is actually when Ben really did hit me hard,” she said. “Then that anger ignites… there's a spontaneous anger because you think, ‘You hurt me,’ and then you do sort of punch back… But it's like a surfer with a wave. You feel it coming, you think, ‘Great, I can ride this one.’”"
1E6OU0u,2015-03-01 00:00:00,"Republicans Blocking DHS Funding Are 'Delusional,' Rep. Peter King Says - ABC News",http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/republicans-blocking-dhs-funding-delusional-rep-peter-king/story?id=29308691,"House Homeland Security Committee member Rep. Peter King today called some members of his Republican caucus ""self-righteous and delusional"" for opposing a bill that would fund the Department of Homeland Security.

""I said the other night, when I was at the Republican meeting, that they are self-righteous and delusional,"" King said on ""This Week"" of the Republican contingent holding up the bill because of their opposition to President Obama's executive action on immigration.

""We're talking about maybe 40 or 50 people at most, out of a caucus of 247, out of a Congress of 435. We cannot allow such a small group to be dominating and controlling what happens in the United States Congress, especially at a time when we're confronting terrorism,"" the New York Republican told ABC News' Martha Raddatz.

House Republicans have tied funding for DHS to legislation that would roll back Obama's executive orders on immigration, a move King calls ""irresponsible.""

""Listen, I am as opposed to this immigration action as they are. But the fact is, it's essential that we fund the Department of Homeland Security,"" King said. ""We saw what happened in Denmark, in Paris, what ISIS is doing with the beheadings. We had the people being arrested in New York just the other night. And for these people to be threatening to defund the Department of Homeland Security at a time when our threat streams have never been greater at any time since 9/11, it's absolutely irresponsible.""

Despite a looming shutdown, the bill to fund the Homeland Security Department has been stalled in Congress for weeks. On Friday night, the House approved a one-week funding extension in order to avoid a partial shutdown, after voting down a longer extension, in a major failure for House Speaker John Boehner.

But King said he maintains his confidence in Boehner's ability to wrangle his party's votes, and he called for a ""up or down"" vote on a clean funding bill this week.

""We have to stand behind John Boehner and John Boehner has to find a way this week, as soon as possible in the week, once Prime Minister Netanyahu finishes his speech, to bring the clean bill to the floor of the House for a vote, an up or down vote. That's all we're asking for is democracy. Let that come to a vote,"" King said. ""There's no doubt it will pass."""
1E92kr1,2015-02-13 00:00:00,Valentine's Day 2015: Source Locally Versus Colombia-Grown - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Business/valentines-day-2015-source-locally-versus-colombia-grown/story?id=28932494,"Most Americans will be receiving flowers from out of the country this Valentine's Day, but there's a small movement urging people to buy ""local.""

Imports account for about 64 percent of fresh flowers sold in the United States, according to the Society of American Florists. Colombia supplies 78 percent of all American cut flowers, followed by Ecuador at 15 percent and Mexico at 2 percent. Colombia also supplies half of all flowers going to Canada.

The Colombian flower industry values itself at more than $1 billion. Last year, the U.S. imported 954.6 million flowers from Colombia, up 2.2 percent from 2013. At Miami airport, where two-thirds of total exports from Colombia travel, customs officers constantly shuffle through shipments of flowers.

""We have production available year-round bit the flowers delivered as we speak are probably cut less than 24 hours ago, or a max of 48 hours before they’re delivered,"" Procolombia's executive director of the U.S. Luis German said. ""It's a very tight cycle.""

Meanwhile, some American growers are touting the ""slow flowers"" movement: its closer oversight of labor practices and the so-called smaller carbon footprint with its shorter travel distance. The Association of Specialty Cut Flower Growers reported an all-time high of 700 members, the majority of whom are in the U.S.

“The florists I supply simply like how much fresher my flowers are. They’re not having to pick through my supply to pull out wilted or dead petals and leaves,” Megan Hird, a ""farmer florist"" in Nebraska told the Associated Press.

California is the biggest fresh flower growing state, covering 76 percent of the domestic market, followed by Washington at 6 percent and New Jersey and Oregon tied at 4 percent.

Jennifer Sparks, vice president of marketing for the Society of American Florists, said most florists tell her consumers are not asking for flowers grown in specific areas, imported or domestic.

""A few florists have told me that in the case when a customer does ask about the origin of the flowers, they are impressed when they explain that flowers come from all over the world, including the U.S.,"" she said.

Marie Ackerman, Teleflora's vice president of education, suggests customers select in-season flowers. Otherwise, you will likely pay a premium. Peonies, for example, aren't in season until the spring, pending location.

""Even still, some of the most exotic peonies come from Thailand so one stem may cost you $15 or more even when sourced in-season,"" she said."

Following President Obama’s announcement in December that the United States would begin normalizing diplomatic relations with Cuba, the league put out a statement saying league officials “are closely monitoring the situation,” and, “will continue to track this significant issue.”

Today, ABC News learned Major League Baseball is in talks with federal agencies to determine how the policy change impacts professional baseball. Specifically, baseball wants to figure out how the new regulations and rules apply to baseball as a business, a spokesman with Major League Baseball told ABC News.

ABC’s sister network, ESPN, reported earlier this week that the Boston Red Sox were exploring an exhibition game in Cuba in the spring, but that it probably wouldn’t happen that soon.

Besides the Red Sox, there have been inquiries from teams including the Baltimore Orioles and Washington Nationals, sources in Cuba told ABC News.

Although rumors of “diamond diplomacy” have surfaced recently, officials must figure out how recent rule changes apply to Major League Baseball before any type of game could be discussed, as the league couldn’t even send equipment to Cuba under the old rules, a spokesman for MLB said today.

The league is not aware of any teams setting an exhibition match, as they’d have to get permission first.

MLB has an historic and strong connection with Cuba. Before the revolution, the Dodgers, Pirates and Giants all hosted spring training on the island.

Many Cubans have played Major League Baseball, including Jose Canseco in the '80s, and current players such as Yasiel Puig of the Los Angeles Dodgers and Aroldis Chapman of the Cincinnati Reds. Many of the current players defected from Cuba to play in the major leagues."

Police said officers were responding to a report of a robbery, and when they confronted the suspect the incident apparently escalated.

""The preliminary investigation revealed that during that altercation, at least one less-than-lethal device, a Taser, was deployed,"" LAPD Sgt. Barry Montgomery said. ""However, at this time, we still do not know if that Taser did strike the suspect.

""After that, the struggle continued and an officer-involved shooting occurred,"" he said.

LAPD Commander Andrew Smith said the man reached for an officer's weapon while resisting arrest.

""Anytime we have an officer-involved shooting and there's a loss of life, people are upset and justifiably so,"" Smith said. ""Nobody out there, no police officer out there, wants to be involved in a situation like this where you have to take someone else's life.""

""Next thing I knew, I heard one shot and I looked over across the street and I see three more shots being fired at the guy who was laying down on the ground. Instead of handcuffing the guy, they straight out shot him,"" Jackson said.

A video that was posted to Facebook recorded the struggle, and then the moment when an officer shot the man.

Police have not released the name of the suspect. The LAPD's specialized Force Investigative Division and Los Angeles County District Attorney's Justice System Integrity Division are reviewing the shooting."

A half foot of snow was reported from central Missouri to the central Ohio Valley through Sunday morning. Up to 9 inches of snow fell in central Illinois and snowfall accumulations hit 8 inches in northern Indiana.

The southern side of this latest winter storm brought freezing rain to the mid-Atlantic region Sunday morning. The freezing rain eventually moved farther north, reaching central Pennsylvania to New Jersey by Sunday afternoon.

More than a quarter inch of ice accumulated in parts of Maryland, with a glaze to two-10ths of an inch of ice reported throughout much of the mid-Atlantic, icing over roads and causing numerous accidents throughout the day.

On Sunday evening, the heaviest of the precipitation was focused over the Northeast with snow falling from New York City north to Boston, and freezing rain falling for areas south of Interstate 80.

The highest snowfall totals in the Northeast will stretch from northwestern Pennsylvania and along the New York state line into southern New England. More than 6 inches of snow is expected in this region, with isolated totals up to 8 inches possible.

The heaviest of the snow will fall just south of Boston, however several inches of snow are expected there as well. With 5.6 inches of snow, this winter would tie the record for the city's all-time snowiest season, and it looks like they will come up just short of that with this event.

The snow and freezing rain will end early Monday morning, right before the busy morning commute. However, some slick spots on area roadways are still possible.

Another winter storm will be taking aim on millions of Americans beginning Monday night and hitting many of the same locations that received snow over the weekend.

However, the next storm will track north and bring more rain than snow to many cities. Some heavy rain is possible as well prompting flooding concerns from the Tennessee Valley to New England given the current widespread snow cover throughout the country."

Michelle Parker was last seen on Nov. 17, 2011, the same day the prerecorded episode featuring herself and her former fiance, Dale Smith, aired nationally as they attempted to resolve a dispute over a $5,000 engagement ring.

Investigators have considered Smith, the father of Parker's twins, the lone person of interest in her disappearance, although he has never been charged.

Orlando police on Friday revisited a wooded area near Smith's home where Parker was last seen dropping off their toddlers, and the body of water where her cell phone was found two weeks later. According to authorities, about 30 officers searched for roughly three hours and Parker's family was present during the search.

Although the search teams combed through the wooded area, they came up empty.

""It's agony not knowing what happened to your child,"" Parker's mother, Yvonne Stewart, told ABC News. ""They thought they should go back and take a look at these woods.""

Parker's mother said authorities told her that search teams were looking for a decal that was missing from Parker's Humvee when it was found days later in a parking lot across town.

""I don't want to find her dead. I want to find her alive."" said Parker's father Brad.

Smith's attorney told reporters that his client committed no crime. He has custody of their children.

""We are going to find Michelle,"" said Brad Parker. ""It's just a matter of time."""

Ted Cruz will announce his presidential campaign Monday, becoming the first major presidential candidate to officially enter the 2016 race.

Aides to the Republican senator tell ABC News he will make the announcement during the convocation speech at Liberty University, a Christian college in Lynchburg, Virginia, on Monday morning. News of the announcement was first reported by the Houston Chronicle.

Cruz, 44, is the first major candidate to enter what is expected to be a crowded Republican primary field that will likely include former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, Senator Marco Rubio, R-Florida, and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. By announcing his candidacy, the Texas senator will skip the exploratory process many presidential candidates undergo.

Cruz's announcement will officially kick off the 2016 presidential race. Several candidates, including Paul and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, are expected to announce their presidential campaigns in April.

The Texas senator has made frequent trips to the early primary states over the last two years as he's mulled his presidential bid. He's traveled to Iowa nine times, New Hampshire five times, and South Carolina five times since 2012.

WHO IS TED CRUZ?

Cruz rose to political stardom in 2012 as a Tea Party candidate who secured the Republican nomination in the Texas Senate primary against then Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, the establishment-backed candidate. In November of that year, Cruz won the Senate seat and is currently serving in his third year in the Senate.

He has been an outspoken critic of President Obama’s immigration and healthcare plans. In 2013, he led a 21-hour filibuster on the Senate floor in protest against Obamacare just days before a government shutdown.

Cruz, a Cuban-American, was born in Calgary, Canada to an American mother and a father who fled Cuba in the 1950's. Cruz held dual U.S. and Canadian citizenship until 2014 when he formally renounced his Canadian citizenship.

Cruz received his undergraduate degree from Princeton University and graduated magna cum laude from Harvard Law School. From 2003 to 2008, he served as solicitor general in Texas.

Despite being a first-time presidential candidate, Cruz has some experience in national campaigns. In 2000, he served as a domestic policy adviser on George W. Bush’s presidential campaign.

Cruz has also worked at the Federal Trade Commission and Justice Department, in addition to clerking for former Chief Justice William Rehnquist."

1Eb3cgG,2015-03-02 00:00:00,Officials: Mom Knew Her Son Mohammed Emwazi Was 'Jihadi John' - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/International/officials-mom-knew-son-jihadi-john/story?id=29321335,"The mother of the man identified as ""Jihadi John"" recognized immediately from his voice that her son was the alleged killer when he appeared in his first beheading video in August, Kuwaiti government officials told ABC News.

The father of Mohammed Emwazi, who was questioned recently in Kuwait, told authorities the family last heard from his son in mid-2013 when the younger Emwazi called them from Turkey. Emwazi said he was going to do humanitarian work in Syria, the father said, according to the officials. Emwazi's father, a former policeman, said he's been waiting for news of his son's death ever since.

Instead of doing humanitarian work, Emwazi allegedly linked up with ISIS and has appeared in videos online apparently beheading Westerners, including several who were actual humanitarians. Late Tuesday, a British newspaper reported Emwazi's father had denied the Kuwaiti officials' claims that his wife recognized their son's voice in the videos.

Ever since, a complex picture is emerging of the alleged murderer's life before ISIS. Born in Kuwait, Emwazi moved with his family to London when he was a boy.

A school picture captured what appeared to be an angelic smile, but a teacher told the BBC Emwazi had anger management issues, for which he eventually went to therapy.

A former boss of Emwazi's in Kuwait, when Emwazi briefly lived there in 2010, told The Guardian that Emwazi was a stellar employee, ""calm and decent.""

""He was the best employee we ever had,"" the former boss said of the then 21-year-old.

Even later, a member of the British activist group CAGE told reporters he saw Emwazi as a ""beautiful young man.""

But at the same time, Emwazi was linked by court documents to a number of alleged jihadists in London who purportedly supported a terror group in Somalia.

In recent years Emwazi had attempted to move back to Kuwait to pursue a computer science job there but was denied entry, according to an official with CAGE, with whom he corresponded. Instead, Emwazi is alleged to have eventually gone to join ISIS.

Now, a former ISIS fighter says Emwazi is being used by the terror group.

""ISIS play him like a piano, a celebrity to attract our Muslim brothers in Europe,"" the fighter told the BBC. ""But some think he is showing off, they think he is being used by ISIS.""

The fighter described Emwazi as cold and ""strange"" when the two met in Syria.

Still, Emwazi is a high-value target for American and coalition airstrikes. But authorities told ABC News he has been careful to avoid using computers or his cell phone, which could give away his location.

[Editor's Note: This report has been updated to reflect that officials were referencing Emwazi's father's statements to them. It is unclear if his mother was interviewed as well."

Wilfrido Cardenas Hoffman, 31, faces up to five years in prison after federal prosecutors said he used a voice over IP app to place more than 90 phone calls from his home in Venezuela to 47 telephone numbers in Newtown.

According to court records Hoffman invoked the name of the gunman.

""This is Adam Lanza. I'm gonna [expletive] kill you. You're dead. You're dead. You hear me? You're dead."" In another phone call, Hoffman said: ""This is Adam Lanza. I'm gonna kill you. You're dead. With my machine gun. You're dead [expletive].""

5 Disturbing Things We Learned Today About Sandy Hook Shooter Adam Lanza

In one instance, court records show Hoffman's call was answered by a 15-year-old high school student, who described Hoffman to investigators as ""creepy and young"" and stated that she was terrified by the threats.

""These threatening calls, just two days after the tragedy, compounded the collective suffering of all of the citizens of Newtown and needlessly stressed law enforcement resources at a critical time,"" US Attorney Deirdre Daly said. ""It is reprehensible criminal conduct.""

Hoffman has been detained for seven months since his arrest at Miami International Airport as he was en route from Mexico to his home country. The defense argued he should be sentenced to time served because he is mentally ill.

""At the time he made the phone calls at issue in this case, there is no question that Mr. Hoffman was suffering from the symptoms of schizophrenia and unmedicated,"" his defense attorney argued in court papers.

Beck showed photos of an officer's gun with alterations he said were consistent with a struggle over the weapon.

""As you can see, the slide is partially engaged and a round has been partially ejected and fouled the firing chamber,"" Beck said. ""This is indicative of a struggle over the weapon. As you can also see, the magazine is dislodged from its resting place. This is also indicative of force used on the weapon. There's also a screen grab from a privately taken video. If you examine that, it appears that the suspect's hand is reaching for the officer's waistband in the area where his pistol would be located.""

The officers involved in the shooting were not identified, but Beck said two were treated for injuries at a hospital and released, and one is now using crutches.

He added that officers first used a stun gun against the man, and then shot him when he continued to resist, after responding to a robbery call.

""It appears to me the officers acted compassionately up until the time when force was required,"" Beck said.

The investigation will take video footage of the event into account, including video from two body cameras that were worn by the officers involved in the incident, he added.

At least two of the officers had been through the most extensive mental illness training offered by the department and had experience working with the largely homeless population of the area, known as Skid Row, according to Beck.

""The Skid Row population is very transient, obviously, and this individual had only been there a short amount of time ... so I don't know about his familiarity to the officers,"" Beck said.

""This is an extreme tragedy,"" Beck added. ""We feel great compassion in the LAPD for people who live in conditions of homelessness and often mental illness with no treatment.""

The investigation into Sunday's fatal shooting may take up to five months, a LAPD source familiar with the incident told ABC News.

“These are some of the most exhaustive investigations we do,” Beck told reporters.

Whether or not the man tried grabbing one of the officers’ weapons is going to be at the heart of the investigation.

""When you see an individual moving that way with their arms flailing around, that’s a concern,"" said former LAPD officer Steve Gomez, who now works as a consultant for ABC News.

""If he happened to get his hand on one of the officers’ guns, that would trigger that kind of reaction from one of the officers,"" Gomez said."

The recipe to cure eye infections comes from ""Bald’s Leechbook,"" an old English leather-bound tome that was buried deep within the British Library in London. When scientists painstakingly followed a step-by-step recipe to recreate the old world salve, they found it killed over 90 percent of a Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus -- also known as the MRSA bacteria -- that was grown in a petri dish of mouse cells.

The tenth-century concoction contained two species of allium (garlic, plus either onion or leek), wine from a vineyard that has existed since the ninth century and oxgall, the bile from a cow’s stomach. A very specific set of instructions included brewing the solution in a brass vessel, straining it through a cloth and then letting the mixture sit for nine days before use.

The researchers concluded it wasn’t one particular ingredient that did the trick but rather the entire recipe.

“We thought that Bald’s eye salve might show a small amount of antibiotic activity, because each of the ingredients has been shown by other researchers to have some effect on bacteria in the lab,"" Freya Harrison, one of the lead Nottingham researchers, said in a statement. “But we were absolutely blown away by just how effective the combination of ingredients was.”

Each year, 90,000 Americans suffer from invasive MRSA infection, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It has become one of the most antibiotic-resistant bugs known, costing billions of dollars in health care spending and killing about 20,000 yearly. The CDC says MRSA is a particular threat in hospital settings, though in recent years infections from the deadly bacteria have declined by over 50 percent.

While the results of the experiment are intriguing, the team is looking for more funding to see if the treatment has any practical application in the real world. The preliminary results done using the simple mouse cells were presented at the annual conference of the Society for General Microbiology in Birmingham earlier this week."

Pyatt said those systems included surface to air missiles, artillery, and rockets.

He also accused Russian military units ""along the border"" of ""preparing a large shipment of supplies"" to the Russian-backed separatist fighters.

The images, taken by the commercial satellite image company DigitalGlobe and tweeted out by Pyatt, are of an area near the village of Debaltseve.

The chocolate shooter is a cocoa powder catapult that launches two small bumps of cocoa powder into the user’s nostrils.

While it is obvious that creator Dominique Persoone has found himself at the extreme of chocolate obsession, what’s less known are the possible health effects of snorting chocolate; there is no research on the impact to the nose or lungs, although medical experts are far from condoning this indulgence.

However, that has not discouraged Persoone from reportedly selling more than 20,000 kits online. Nor has it stopped a Vancouver, Canada, shop from becoming the first known North American store to offer these cocoa bumps.

Mary Jean Dunsdon has been selling the kits for $109 or $2 per sniff to more than to 100 customers. And so far, she has had no complaints.

“We get some people back who’d like to try it again. Or people that like to try both flavors, but no there’s no addict,” Dunsdon says.

So why are we snorting chocolate? It could be the same reason why we’re willing to plunk down big bucks for artisanal chocolate. The Mast Brothers, Rick and Michael Mast, sell $8 bars made in their chocolate factory in Brooklyn, New York.

“For people that want to take their pleasures to the next level you engage in a company like Mast Brothers,” says co-owner Rick Mast.

And for the Iowa natives the next level means bringing it back to basics. Rick’s brother Michael says they want people to “think of chocolate in the purest sense and not just as a bar with a laundry list of ingredients.”

They do so by sourcing cacao beans from small farms around the world, and bypassing large producers. The brothers use select beans for small batches that have a distinctively different taste from the chocolate bars you find at the grocery store checkout counter. Their chocolate is often referred to as bean-to-bar or craft chocolate. This delicious trend is part of a $330 million premium chocolate category that according to the National Confectioners Association has seen 15 percent growth since 2013.

At the University of Michigan, Dr. Ashley Gearhardt runs a cleverly disguised room that looks like a fast food restaurant, but is actually a science lab where she studies food addictions. Chocolate, she has reported, is consistently ranked as the number one food respondents have trouble putting down.

And her research shows that the culprit for the obsession could be our brains.

“That same brain region is one of those regions that we know is really important in other drug addictions,” Gearhardt says. “This section of the brain is activating and saying you want that you crave that you really should get more of that.”

Which could explain how The Mast Brothers have sold more than a million bars sold around the world and are opening a factory this week in London, England. Rick Mast credits their success to one simple truth about chocolate.

“We said many times chocolate is the most popular food on the earth,” he says. “People start smiling just by hearing the sound of it and they just want to taste it, they crave it, they are addicted to it. It’s everything to a lot of people.”"

Jurors in Westchester County deliberated for over three days before finding Lacey Spears, 27, guilty.

She will be sentenced April 8. Spears faces a maximum sentence of twenty five years to life in prison

Garnett Spears was taken to the hospital in January 2014 for an unexplained, and extremely dangerous level of sodium in his system. He died several days later.

Five months after the boy’s death, Lacey Spears, of Kentucky, surrendered to police. She pleaded not guilty at the time.

“Throughout his five years, Garnett Spears was forced to suffer through repeated hospitalizations, unneeded surgical procedures and ultimately poisoning with salt, all at the hands of the one person who should have been his ultimate protector: his mother. Using the child’s 'illnesses' to self aggrandize herself, her actions directly lead to her son’s tortured death. We will continue to ensure that his mother is held accountable and that justice for Garnett Spears will be served in his memory,” said Westchester DA Janet DiFiore.

The defense blamed the hospital for the boy’s death, but prosecutors said there was no explanation other than the mother’s deliberate introduction of salt into his feeding tube.

During a 14-day trial, prosecutors said Spears did it for attention. She had posted frequently to Facebook about her son’s health problems."

Nine buildings in downtown Grantville, Georgia, 35 miles outside of Atlanta, are now collectively on auction on eBay.

The historic area has been a set for several recent movies -- including ""Lawless"" with Shia LaBeouf and Jessica Chastain, ""The War"" with Kevin Costner and Elijah Wood and ""Dumb and Dumber To"" with Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels, former Grantsville mayor Jim Sells told ABC News today.

Sells bought the commercial properties when they were in foreclosure, he said.

""Scouts from the entertainment industry love the brick, 'old-town-square-type' buildings,"" he said. ""Downtown Grantville has an historic appeal. A lot of the buildings were built in the 1880s, and we have a railroad runs right through the heart of town.""

Four new movies, including the ""The Ring 3"" and ""83 Days"" with big name stars Tom Cruise, Bryan Cranston and Danny Glover, just contacted him to shoot in area, he added.

""I would love to see a movie studio or a commercial developer buy it and get everything rented out,"" Sells said. ""It's dirt cheap at about $30 per square foot, and we've done all the dirty work by renovating everything.""

The town died down after after the textile mills closed during the recession, Sells said.

Now, most of downtown Grantville's revenue comes from tourists from all over the globe to tour the site that's been popular with the entertainment industry, he added.

""There is so much potential for revenue with buses of tourists coming in and our commuter residents who'd like to see more local business,"" Sells said.

The nine buildings up for sale, which include about 20,000 to 25,000 square feet of usable space in total, can developed into retail areas, loft apartments, bars or pubs, restaurants, pharmacies or office spaces, Sells said. Property tours are held everyday at 2 p.m., he added.

As of this morning, 194 eBay users had the listing on their watch list, though none have made an offer yet for the vacant commercial lot on auction for the starting price of $680,000.

""We've gotten several curious calls, but we're still hoping for a serious buyer,"" Sells said. ""This is a huge opportunity for someone to own a piece of history and revitalize a town with great potential."""

“It’s a time for truth, a time to rise to the challenge, just as Americans have always done. I believe in America and her people and I believe we can stand up and restore our promise,” the Republican senator says in the video. “It’s going to take a new generation of courageous conservatives to help make America great again and I’m ready to stand with you to lead the fight.”

The reference to a “new generation” could be seen as a jab at former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, who hails from a politically famous family that includes a brother and a father who were presidents.

Cruz, who also launched a new presidential campaign site, will further address his candidacy during a convocation speech at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia Monday. Ahead of the speech, photos surfaced of Cruz and his family preparing for the announcement day with a walk-through that included a practice kiss between Cruz and his wife.

Cruz, 44, is the first major presidential candidate to officially announce a presidential campaign this year.

Cruz’s video message was sent to his 353,000 followers on Twitter – a social media platform he has embraced since his 2012 Senate campaign that transformed him from a political unknown to a Tea Party star.

In 2011, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich became the first person to ever use Twitter to announce a presidential campaign."

“Kyle was very physically exhausted,” skipper Leo Miller told ABC, adding Longmore was spent six hours directly in the sun, and the team helped feed him while he was fighting the swordfish.

""We didn't think the fish was all that big at first but then it came up and jumped, and we knew it was a fair size,” Miller said. The fish jumped 23 times, getting closer and closer to their boat, he added.

But to the confusion of civics students everywhere, Ted Cruz’s presidential story begins in Canada.

The Texas senator, who officially announced his bid for president today at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia, was born in Calgary, Canada in 1970. (Cruz even briefly mentioned Canada in his speech.)

Ted Cruz Announces 2016 Presidential Campaign

So, why doesn't the Canadian-born US senator seem to be worried?

Let’s review:

According to the Constitution, a presidential candidate must be a “natural born citizen” of the United States.

While Cruz received U.S. citizenship through his American mother, he was a Canadian citizen by virtue of his birth, the Dallas Morning News discovered in 2013.

While some conservatives –and Donald Trump—have questioned Cruz’s presidential eligibility, and the Supreme Court has never weighed in on the subject, many legal experts believe his Canadian citizenship didn’t disqualify him from running for president. Both John McCain and George Romney ran for president, despite being born in the Panama Canal Zone and Mexico, respectively.

The most recent defense of Cruz’s eligibility came in a recent article in the Harvard Law Review, where two lawyers who worked in the Bush and Obama administrations argued that Cruz’s mother’s citizenship and his father’s status as a U.S. resident covered the Constitution’s requirement.

“Despite the happenstance of a birth across the border, there is no question that Senator Cruz has been a citizen from birth and is thus a ‘natural born Citizen’ within the meaning of the Constitution,” wrote Paul Clement, a Bush administration solicitor general and Neal Katyal, a former acting solicitor general in the Obama administration.

Cruz vowed to “renounce any Canadian citizenship” following the initial reporting in 2013.

“Nothing against Canada, but I’m an American by birth and as a U.S. Senator, I believe I should be only an American,” he said in a statement in 2013.

Cruz formally renounced his citizenship in an official ""Canadian Renunciation Letter"" on May 14, 2014."

The bacterium in question, burkholderia pseudomallei, is widespread throughout Southeast Asia and northern Australia, infecting humans and animals via contaminated soil and water entering the blood stream through cuts in the skin, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The high-security laboratory at the Tulane National Primate Research Center in Louisiana, which is studying the bacteria, reported that at least five rhesus macaques not used in studies were infected with the bug, possibly as early as November of last year, according to spokesman Michael Strecker.

How the bacteria made its way from the lab to animals not used in experiments is still an open question despite weeks of investigation by multiple federal and state agencies, including the CDC, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Environmental Protection Agency.

“The only connection among these four animals was their presence in the veterinary hospital during the same period of time,” Dr. Andrew A. Lackner, the director of the center, said in a statement last week, adding that more than 50 soil and water samples from the 500-acre compound have tested negative for the bacteria.

A federal investigator also tested positive for burkholderia, after visiting the center, Jason McDonald, a CDC spokesman, told ABC News. It isn't clear whether he was exposed to the bacteria at the primate center or during travel to an infected region, McDonald said.

However, Strecker said he did not believe the investigator came into contact with the germ at the center.

""At present there is no evidence of Burkholderia pseudomallei in any human or other non-human primate at the TNPRC,"" he told ABC News.

Though the CDC stressed that there is no risk to the general public, the agency said it has directed Tulane to suspend all research until the investigation is complete. The infected animals were euthanized, according to the Tulane statement.

“The veterinary hospital has been thoroughly disinfected, and additional animal testing is ongoing,” Lackner said in a statement. “Tulane continues to work with the CDC, USDA and the EPA, as well as state and local officials on this matter.”

Melioidosis causes fever, headache, loss of appetite, muscle and joint pain. Although full-blown illness from the bacteria is rare, the fatality rate is up to 50 percent in some countries for those who do get sick, studies show.

Also of concern: The bacterium has been studied for use as a potential bioweapon, according to the UPMC Center for Health Security, an independent biosecurity think tank."

Christie’s personal travel habits, detailed in a New York Times article include a preference for Cessna Citation X flights, Four Seasons stays and champagne toasts, are all legally consistent with his state’s code of conduct for governors – as long as everything is paid for by friends.

“The governor may accept gifts, favors, services, gratuities, meals, lodging or travel expenses from relatives or personal friends that are paid for with personal funds,” the code reads.

Lately, those friends include King Abdullah of Jordan, Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones and Republican superdonor Sheldon Adelson – all with big pockets and big toys, like the private jet Adelson had him fly with his family on during a 2012 trip to Israel, at the same time Adelson was trying to defeat a measure to legalize online gambling in New Jersey (Christie later signed the bill anyway).

Christie also added a provision to the state’s financial disclosure laws in a 2010 executive order that expressly permits him to accept travel and related expenses from foreign governments.

“Christie wrote an ethics code, which essentially says he can accept gifts from a friend, but doesn’t (describe) who ‘personal friends’ are,” said Mark Lagerkvist, an investigative reporter who works for the good government website New Jersey watchdog. Lagerkvist has also battled the Christie administration for years to make records public and currently has a number of public records lawsuits pending against the Christie administration.

Lagerkvist also noted that other state workers, including members of the state legislature, are bound by different ethics regulations. Under New Jersey state ethics codes the governor is allowed to receive gifts from “relatives or personal friends that are paid for with personal funds,” but state legislators cannot receive gifts above $250.

The governor’s office told ABC News last month during the controversy around Christie accepting flights and football tickets from Jones they tried to make state lawmakers subject to the same disclosures as the executive branch, but state lawmakers never took up the legislation.

Christie’s affinity for the finer things in public life has been on display since his time as U.S. Attorney for New Jersey, from 2002 to 2008. A Justice Department investigation into the travel habits of several U.S. Attorneys published the following year found he was “the U.S. Attorney who most often exceeded the government rate without adequate justification,” doing so 61 percent of the time he traveled in this capacity between 2007 and 2009.

Several of his trips involved stays at various Four Seasons Hotels, which was almost double the permissible government rate. The report said he justified one overnight at the Washington, D.C., Four Seasons because he was speaking there the next morning.

“We do not believe this was a suitable justification for exceeding the government rate, particularly by such a large amount, if lodging at the government rate was available at a hotel within a reasonable distance from that hotel,” the IG report said."

Now, the gang from Broken Lizard are back and making a sequel. The guys just launched an Indiegogo campaign with the goal to raise $2 million from now until April 24.

All the original troopers are back -- Jay Chandrasekhar, Kevin Heffernan, Steve Lemme, Paul Soter, and Erik Stolhanske.

Chandrasekhar and Heffernan spoke to ABC News about the comeback and why crowd-funding makes sense for this movie.

""The first one was so difficult to get made,"" Chandrasekhar said. ""Mostly because we were starring in it.""

He added that the likes of George Clooney and Steven Soderbergh were attached to the script as producers, but it never came together. And when they decided to go the independent route, the investors wanted guys like Ben Affleck to play the lead. They stuck to their guns.

""We finally made it and to some degree, it put us on the map and showed our sense of humor was good,"" he said.

Chandrasekhar, who played Thorny, said it took so long to get rolling on a sequel because they wanted to make sure to get it right. In fact, the gang said they have written some 16 drafts and will write another five or six before production starts.

""Also, short of changing all the cops to super heroes, the studios aren't the most friendly place at the moment for this type of movie,"" he said.

Enter IndieGogo. And with funding, Broken Lizard is currently trying to figure out ways to make sure donors get something valuable.

""The first 'Super Troopers' was a very grassroots movie,"" Heffernan said. ""It was something that people found and told their friends about. This approach seems to be a very cool way to get them involved in that same way and get a movie made in that same grassroots feel.""

Both Chandrasekhar and Heffernan said they still run into classic lines from the film as fans come up and ask if they'd ""like another drink right meow"" or give Heffernan, who played Farva, a hard time if he tried to order fast food.

As for plot points, the guys said they are keeping it under wraps, but that it won't be a prequel -- which was one rumor floating around the Internet.

""We are going to pick up the story where we left off and we will be cops,"" Heffernan said."

According to experts, the human brain has evolved to sometimes override our clear sensory perceptions of the world around us meaning sometimes we fall for a good prank.

Dr. Adam Gazzaley, a neuroscientist and professor at the University of California San Francisco Medical School, said humans can override our basic ""bottom up"" sensory perception of the world with ""top down"" processing, meaning we can override natural instincts with rationalizations.

Gazzaley explains that this could mean ignoring what's going in the physical world around us because we believe we ""know"" better than what our sense are telling us.

""It’s based on memories and experiences and that is really a powerful force and an overwhelming force in humans that shape how we view the world,"" explained Gazzaley, of human perceptions of the world around us.

Gazzaley said one example of ""top down"" processing overriding our ""bottom up"" perceptions would be missing a close friend on the street because you're in engrossed in your phone screen. Another clear example is going to see a magic show and trying to figure out how the trick is performed, but being unable to.

""In the whole misdirection thing when [the magician is] showing you their hand, your experience is telling you this is important,"" said Gazzaley. ""But they're doing something with the other hand.""

Gazzaley said magicians have told him that intoxicated people are better at figuring out the trick because their ""top down"" processing is dulled.

""You set up your whole belief system based on memories and goals. It shapes your reality in a way that is not exactly corresponding with more on the surface reality,"" said Gazzaley. ""It could create the type of illusions that magicians thrive on.""

Gazzaley said as a result people can easily be taken in by a good April Fool's prank.

""April fool’s jokes ... play off across your belief structure and your view of reality to create something that in other circumstances isn’t that believable,"" he said.

In addition to the ""top down"" fake out, there's also scare tactic pranks that humans are hard-wired to respond to, according to experts.

Dr. Tanvir Syed, a neurologist at the University Hospitals Case Medical Center in Cleveland, said that the brain is designed to perceive any threat as real, even if it's a rubber snake.

""The way we process any kind of stimulus is by threat level,"" said Syed. ""The way our nervous system is, we respond to threats very quickly…to prepare us for fight or flight.""

That means if someone decides to try and prank you with something that scares you, you're likely not going to be able to remain calm and collected. Syed said your brain would rather react to a threat--even a fake threat--than be injured.

Even if you try to plan ahead and have no reaction to a prank designed to scare you, Syed says you'll likely have a subconscious response to any threat, which is ""100 times more powerful"" than the conscious mind in terms of brain synapses."

Conrad Claus, one of the attorneys who represents Erich Nowsch, 19, told ABC News he questions why descriptions of events leading up to the fatal shooting of Tammy Meyers changed, why Meyers and her children would behave the way they purportedly did, and why a composite sketch of a suspect done before his client was arrested Thursday does not more closely resemble Nowsch.

The timeline of events in the case, which police have said is based upon eyewitness accounts from Meyers' children, has evolved over time.

Initially, police said it appeared someone followed Meyers, 44, and her 15-year-old daughter home from a road-rage incident following a late-night driving lesson on Feb. 12.

Later, police said Meyers and her daughter fled the alleged road-rage incident but were not followed home. The daughter told police the ""road rage"" involved the driver of the other car getting out of the driver's seat and saying, ""I'm gonna come back for you and your daughter,"" according to a police warrant issued Friday.

After returning home, Meyers and her armed, 22-year-old son went looking for the person who allegedly threatened Meyers and her daughter, the police said in the revised timeline. According to an arrest report released Friday, they found that person two blocks from their home.

Nowsch told his friends, according to the report, that he saw a car with a gun pointed at him coming toward him. The report alleged Nowsch opened fire on the approaching vehicle driven by Tammy Meyers. Meyers and her son then drove home, according to the police report, only to have Nowsch appear at their home and open fire. The son returned fire, police said, and when the shooting stopped Meyers was critically injured. She died at a hospital two days later.

After the arrest of Nowsch, who lived near the Meyers' home, Meyers' husband, Bob Meyers, revealed another new detail: He said his wife actually knew the teen suspect and even ""fed him, she gave him money.""

“We know this boy. I couldn’t tell you this before. He knew where I lived,” Bob Meyers told reporters outside his house Thursday. “We knew how bad he was, but we didn’t know he was this bad, that he’s gotten to this point.”

Police said they only learned of the Meyers’ personal connection to Nowsch hours before the arrest.

Besides expressing doubt about whether the “road rage” occurred, Claus questioned why Meyers and her daughter would not have gone to the police immediately after allegedly being threatened, or why the family wouldn't have told the police who allegedly confronted the mother and daughter if they knew the person.

The Las Vegas Metro Police Department was not available for comment Saturday.

The Meyers family has made no public statements since Thursday.

Nowsch is charged with murder, attempted murder and illegal discharge of a gun, and expected to make his first appearance in court Monday."
1EfdSeb,2015-03-03 00:00:00,Former CIA Head David Petraeus to Plead Guilty - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/cia-head-david-petraeus-plead-guilty/story?id=29340487,"Decorated war veteran and former CIA director David Petraeus has entered into an agreement with federal prosecutors in which he would plead guilty to a misdemeanor charge for mishandling classified information.

The charge, unauthorized removal and retention of classified material, stems, in part, from documents the former director allegedly provided to his mistress.

In November 2012, Petraeus resigned as director of the CIA after little more than a year on the job. For 37 years before that, he served in the U.S. Army, including as commander of American forces in Iraq and Afghanistan.

The plea deal reached with prosecutors includes a recommendation of two years of probation and a $40,000 fine, according to court documents.

Petraeus provided Broadwell access to his “Black Books,” which contained Petraeus' notes, including highly classified material from his command in Afghanistan, according to charging documents in the case.

“A total of eight such books ... contained classified information regarding the identities of covert officers, war strategy, intelligence capabilities and mechanisms, diplomatic discussion, quotes and deliberative discussion from high-level National Security Council meetings, and defendant David Howell Petraeus’s discussions with the president of the United States of America,"" the documents said.

Following the agreement with Petraeus, the Justice Department issued a statement: “Three documents -- a criminal information, a plea agreement and a statement of facts -- were filed today in the United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina’s Charlotte Division in the case of United States v. David Howell Petraeus. The criminal information charges the defendant with one count of unauthorized removal and retention of classified material. ... The plea agreement and corresponding statement of facts, both signed by the defendant, indicate that he will plead guilty to the one-count criminal information.""

Petraeus’ attorney, David Kendall told ABC News he had “no comment” on the guilty plea.

Petraeus and Broadwell met while Broadwell was a graduate student at Harvard University working on a dissertation about Petraeus. She ultimately gained tremendous access to the decorated war hero and former four-star general, publishing his biography, “All In,” in January 2012 -- just 10 months before his resignation from the CIA.

Their affair became public by chance. The FBI was trying figure out who had been sending allegedly harassing emails to a Florida woman with ties to senior U.S. military officials.

The FBI traced the emails to Broadwell, and a review of her communications ultimately led the FBI to discover her affair with Petraeus, who was married.

Though Broadwell had a security clearance of her own, the affair raised some national security concerns. Federal authorities wondered whether Petraeus had given her access to information she wasn’t authorized to see, and they wanted to know if she had stored classified material at her home.

Within days of the affair becoming public, FBI agents searched Broadwell’s home in North Carolina.

In recent months, some federal investigators have been pushing more senior officials within the Justice Department to file charges against Petraeus. Eric Holder, however, had yet to sign off on such a move.

In an interview with ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos in January, Holder insisted the Petraeus probe was still “ongoing” and was being “done in a fair and an appropriate way.”

Broadwell was not charged in the case.

Since their affair became public, Petraeus and Broadwell have separately apologized for any pain caused to family, friends and supporters.

In addition, in a private letter to a friend two weeks after his resignation, Petraeus wrote: “I screwed up royally. ... I paid the price, appropriately.”

In 2013, Petraeus joined the global investment firm KKR. He also serves as a visiting professor of public policy at the City University of New York's Macaulay Honors College and serves on several veterans organizations' advisory boards, according to KKR's website.

Paul Getty, was suffering from several undisclosed health issues at the time of his death, a police spokeswoman said today.

""At this time, it appears as though he died of natural causes but the coroner will obviously make that determination in their final report,"" Det. Meghan Aguilar told ABC News.

Craig Harvey, the chief of investigations for the Coroner's office, told ABC that Getty has not yet been examined by the medical examiner and that will happen either Thursday or Friday.

Harvey went on to say that preliminary observations do not indicate trauma or foul play.

""I also suspect that the final cause of death will be deferred and additional toxicology or tissue studies will be ordered that could result in any final ruling being delayed for 6 to 8 weeks or more,"" Harvey said.

Police responded to Getty's home at around 2:20 p.m. Tuesday after receiving a call for an ambulance from an unidentified woman. Police are not investigating the case in a criminal capacity because the cause of death has not yet been officially determined, authorities said.

Getty's father, Gordon Getty, is one of industrialist J. Paul Getty's five sons. J. Paul Getty was once considered the richest man in the world."

Bobbi Kristina Brown, the daughter of pop icons Bobby Brown and the late Whitney Houston, has been at the hospital surrounded by family members ever since Gordon and a friend found her unresponsive at her Roswell, Georgia, home.

Gordon's attorneys continued, saying Brown has only ""offered an opportunity to potentially meet with Bobbi Kristina"" if their client meets Brown's conditions, which they advised against, ""particularly in light of Mr. Brown's inability to guarantee access.""

""But in an effort to do all he can to visit, Nick has repeatedly offered to meet with Mr. Brown privately to discuss his request in person, rather than through lawyers,"" the statement read. ""Those offers have also been rejected. We hope Mr. Brown has a change of heart.""

Brown's attorney said on Saturday that Gordon was offered a chance to see Bobbi Kristina.

""To address the continued and never ending media requests for comment about Mr. Gordon’s requests to visit Bobbi Kristina, let me be very clear, Mr. Gordon was offered an opportunity to potentially visit Bobbi Kristina and he declined to meet the terms of any possible visit,"" said Christopher Brown of Brown & Rosen LLC, legal counsel for Bobby Brown.

The statement did not elaborate on what those visitation terms were, but added, ""We are only concerned with individuals that can help Bobbi Kristina and bring resolution to this investigation. Obviously Mr. Gordon is not as desperate to visit Bobbi Kristina as he wants the world to believe.”

Shortly after Brown, 21, was found face down in her tub, her father's lawyer stated that she and Gordon were not married despite the couple announcing a marriage on social media and to reporters last year.

Gordon and Brown got together romantically shortly after the death of Brown's mother, Whitney Houston, in 2012. Before that time, Gordon lived with Houston and her family for almost a decade.

After Brown was discovered by Gordon in her home on Jan. 31, she was taken to North Fulton Hospital, but then moved to Emory University Hospital days later.

Cheering in court

After 411 days behind bars, the Doha, Qatar-based channel's Egyptian cameraman, Baher Mohamed, and Canadian bureau chief, Mohamed Fahmy, are expected to spend tonight at home with their families.

I AM FREE

Amal Clooney, counsel for Fahmy, said in a statement that she is ""encouraged by the Supreme Court’s findings that the trial was unfair, and by today’s ruling granting Mr Fahmy bail. At the same time, there is no guarantee that a retrial will be carried out in compliance with international standards or result in the full acquittal on all charges that Fahmy deserves. It may also take several months to complete.""

She added, ""this case is not over yet; but it should be. Ten days ago Mohamed Fahmy and his family celebrated the return of Fahmy’s former colleague, Peter Greste, to Australia under the terms of a decree allowing foreign prisoners to be transferred to their home state. Mr Fahmy is eligible for transfer under this same law – and the retrial process that began today does not change that.""

In a statement, an Al Jazeera English spokesman cautiously welcomed the decision: “Bail is a small step in the right direction, and allows Baher and Mohamed to spend time with their families after 411 days apart. The focus though is still on the court reaching the correct verdict at the next hearing by dismissing this absurd case and releasing both these fine journalists unconditionally.”

Following the trial on Twitter all morning, Greste responded with jubilation:

@Bahrooz CONGRATULATIONS BAHER!!! I'M CELEBRATING WITH YOU BROTHER

CONGRATULATIONS TO @Bahrooz & @MFFahmy11 This is a huge step forward. Not time to declare it over, but at least you get to go home!

Judge Hassan Farid set bail at 250,000 Egyptian pounds, or $32,765, but because of the legal process it was unclear when Fahmy and Mohamed would actually be released. The two journalists have been ordered not to leave their houses until the next hearing, which is slated for Feb. 23.

Along with Greste, the three journalists were arrested together in December 2013, accused of spreading ""false news"" and colluding with the Muslim Brotherhood, among other charges. All three received sentences between seven and 10 years and have repeatedly denied the charges."

The report delivered strong criticism of the way Defense Department installations in Afghanistan managed their waste disposal systems -- mistakes which were both expensive and may have exposed U.S. military personnel to significant health risks.

“DOD did not adequately plan for and manage disposal of solid waste at its installations in Afghanistan,” the report reads, calling the approach to waste disposal “haphazard and reactive.”

Throughout its engagement in Afghanistan, U.S. military personnel in the country generated hundreds of tons of solid waste per day, including plastics, food waste, electronic equipment and other products. For years, without proper policies or procedures in place, simple open-air burn pits remained the military’s preferred method for disposing of solid waste.

But the toxic smoke of those open-air burn pits, often contaminated with lead and mercury, posed serious health risks of service members and civilians in their immediate area, SIGAR said. U.S. military personnel returning from Afghanistan complained of health problems, which they said stemmed from exposure to the burn pits on installations.

By August 2010, 251 of these open-air burn pits were in operation on U.S. military bases, according to the SIGAR report.

New regulations from U.S. Central Command ordered long-term military bases to install alternative methods, such as incinerators, to provide a safer way of disposing of waste. The military spent over $81 million to install 23 incinerator systems at nine military installations in Afghanistan.

But the SIGAR report said four military bases—FOB Salerno, FOB Sharana, FOB Ghazni and FOB Maywand—never used their eight incinerators, which cost $20.1 million to build. At one of those bases, FOB Sharana, a design error left the loading area too narrow to even allow forklifts to deposit waste in the 40-ton capacity incinerator. FOB Sharana officials decided to continue using open-air burn pits.

“Given the fact that DOD has been aware for many years of the significant health risks associated with open-air burn pits, it is indefensible that U.S. military personnel, who are already at risk of serious injury and death when fighting the enemy, were put at further risk from the potentially harmful emissions from the use of open-air burn pits,” said John F. Sopko, the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction in an introductory letter to the report.

The report also strongly criticized the management of contracts for the construction and maintenance of the incinerators.

“[W]e found occasions where contractors were paid the full contract amount, even though they failed to perform in accordance with contract requirements,” the report reads.

The report found that incinerators at FOB Salerno and FOB Sharana had major deficiencies when they were transferred to the bases. The report states that in both of those cases, the Defense Department paid the contractors the full amount, approximately $10.4 million, without the deficiencies being corrected."

The rover drilled into Martian rocks and discovered evidence of nitrates, which are essential compounds to the building blocks of life.

""The discovery adds to the evidence that ancient Mars was habitable for life,"" NASA said in a blog post.

Despite the finding, the space agency said ""there is no evidence to suggest that the fixed nitrogen molecules found by the team were created by life.""

The nitrates are believed to be ancient and likely came from meteorite impacts or lightning events, according to NASA, which was also pointed out that the surface of Mars is currently inhospitable to known life forms.

Curiosity has also found signs other elements needed for life once existed on the red planet, including liquid water and organic matter, which were located in the Gale Crater billions of years ago, according to NASA."

Stainbrook, who was on The Dan Patrick Show Tuesday, explained that he drives people around for Uber to make extra money because he gave his full scholarship to his little brother.

Stainbrook is pursuing a MBA degree, while his little brother, a walk-on for the basketball team, is an undergraduate, he said.

""Grad school costs about $14,000 a year while undergrad costs about $43,000 a year,"" Stainbrook said. ""So, for me to be on scholarship and only using it for $14,000 didn't make sense to me.""

Stainbrook said he talked to ""compliance people,"" and they allowed him to switch his scholarship with his little brother.

But Stainbrook doesn't mind driving at all.

In fact, the job's flexibility is perfect for him, and he loves it, Stainbrook told ESPN while on Uber duty last December.

""I think it just slows things down for me,"" he said. ""I love talking to people, I love learning about people, I love making connections.""

Stainbrook added he has student loans to cover, but he's able to use his Uber salary for things like rent and utilities.

""I think once I get a real job or continue to play basketball or whatever I do, that'll be the time I'll retire my Uber driving,"" Stainbrook said. ""I'll miss it, but it'll be a part of my life where I look back, and I say I did fun things in college. Maybe not typical things, but it's been a blast.""

In a new public service announcement released today, Kate makes an appeal on behalf of Place2Be as the charity launches its first Children's Mental Health Week in the U.K.

In the video that's just about two minutes long, Kate talks about the challenges to children's mental health -- including bullying, bereavement, domestic violence and family problems.

Without support, she says, those challenges can become traumatic, leading to mental health problems in children such as anxiety, depression, addiction and self-harm.

""The stigma around mental health means that many children do not get the help that they so badly need. This needs to change. That is why the charity Place2Be is asking us all to talk openly this week,"" Kate, 33, said. ""We need to help young people and their parents understand that it's not a sign of weakness to ask for help.""

She also said a child's mental health was ""just as important as their physical health and deserves the same quality of support,"" noting that ""no one would be embarrassed"" to seek help for a child with a broken arm.

""We really should be equally ready to support a child coping with emotional difficulties,"" Kate, wearing a long-sleeved, belted, blue print dress and with her hair down, added.

Kate also said she and her husband, Prince William, sincerely believe early action can prevent problems in childhood from becoming more serious later in life.

""That is why we're both supporting Place2Be this Children's Mental Health Week, and I hope you'll join us,"" she said.

Kate is pregnant with the couple's second child, due in late April. They don't know the child's gender as they want it to be a surprise. Their first child, George, is 19 months.

Place2Be is a charity that provides emotional support to children more than 230 schools across the United Kingdom. Kate is the organization's royal patron.

According to Place2Be's website, depression and anxiety have increased among teenagers by 75 percent in the past 25 years, and three children in every classroom have a diagnosable mental health problem. The organization also said children were less likely to suffer from serious mental health difficulties later in life if they receive support at an early age.

Children's Mental Health Week officially launches on Monday."

The Svalbard Global Seed Vault, more than 807 miles beyond the Arctic Circle in mountainous permafrost, is the ""world's largest, secure seed storage vault."" Since the vault opened in February 2008, crates of seeds are sent there ""for safe and secure long-term storage in cold and dry rock vaults,"" according to a statement from the Norwegian government.

""The aim of back-up of our collection at Svalbard is to conserve viable African rice diversity forever and available for research for the next generation of scientists,"" Marie Noelle Ndjiondjop, head of AfricaRice genetic resources unit, told ABC News.

The first boxes of Nordic forest tree seeds (Norway spruce and Scots pine) were also stored in the vault. In addition to conservation, the purpose of storing the seeds is to monitor changes in genetic diversity and breeding operations, according to the Norwegian government.

So far, 218 seed lots from the Norwegian Forest Seed Center have been selected for the Svalbard seed vault. The oldest one, a pine sample from Tranøy in Norway, is from 1938, the government said.

Nordic cooperation provided the long-term storage of forest tree seeds, including Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Iceland and Norway.

The vault has three separate rock vaults, 9.5 by 27 meters each.

""The seeds stored in the vault are packed in sealed bags inside sealed boxes, and are placed on high shelf racks inside the vault,"" according to the Norwegian government."

During a news conference last week, Clinton did not go into the details of how the review of her email was conducted, but said it was “thorough” and that she went “above and beyond” what she was required to do in turning over many of her emails to the State Department.

""We went through a thorough process to identify all of my work-related emails and deliver them to the State Department,"" she said, adding that all other emails were personal and pertained to matters such as ""yoga routines,"" ""family vacations,"" and ""planning Chelsea's wedding.""

After the news conference, Clinton’s team distributed a lengthy question-and-answer document that detailed the “multi-step” process. The process appeared to have included an extensive, nuanced search of Clinton’s inbox, but the document did not make clear how many of the emails were opened and read in the review.

On Sunday, Clinton’s spokesman clarified that “every email was read” and that the steps they outlined in the document “were in addition to reading them all, not in lieu of reading them all.”

According to the document, here is a summary of how Clinton’s attorneys, who were tasked with the job, said they sorted through her emails:

The results of the search were that Clinton’s attorneys found 30,490 work-related emails and 31,830 emails that were deemed “private and personal.”

Clinton said on Tuesday she deleted all of the personal emails because she felt she “had no reason to save them.”

The revelation has only raised more questions among Clinton’s detractors about what was in those emails and why she used the private account in the first place.

Clinton said she did so out of “convenience,” but acknowledged during the news conference it “would have been better” if she had used two separate phones and two email accounts.

""I thought using one device would be simpler, and obviously it hasn't worked out that way,” she said.

Democratic strategist and Clinton ally James Carville, speaking on “This Week,” said he suspected the former First Lady “didn't want [Rep.] Louis Gohmert rifling through her e-mails,” and added the controversy “amounts to nothing but a bunch of people flapping their jaws about nothing.”"

She recorded it before her death, and it was presented today to the California legislature ahead of a Senate committee vote.

Maynard, a 29-year-old newlywed from California, was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer in early 2014, but had to move to Oregon for the legal right to end her own life. Oregon is one of five states that gives patients the right to obtain a prescription to die in their sleep. California and New York are considering adopting similar laws.

She died at home surrounded by family after spending 11 months completing her bucket list. Toward the end of her life, she said in one of the videos that she could feel herself getting sicker. One day, she had two seizures and couldn't say her husband's name, she said.

In her legislative testimony, she said some people suggested that she do palliative or terminal sedation instead, in which a person is placed in a drug-induced coma and deprived of nutrients and water until death comes on its own. But she feared she would linger and be minimally conscious and in pain.

""Achieving some control over my passing is very important to me. Knowing that I can leave this life with dignity allows me to focus on living,"" she said. ""It has provided me enormous peace of mind.""

California is considering the End of Life Option Act, which would allow terminally ill adults who are mentally competent to request medication that would allow them to die in their sleep, according to the nonprofit group Compassion and Choices, which advocates for death with dignity. The Senate health committee's final hearing is taking place today."

Killed Them All' - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/US/robert-durst-hbo-hell-killed/story?id=29650536,"Robert Durst, the subject of both an HBO series and law enforcement scrutiny, asked himself off-camera in the closing moments of the final episode of the documentary that aired Sunday, “What the hell did I do?” before answering, “Killed them all, of course.”

Filmmakers asked Durst about similarities in handwriting in a letter he wrote and another linked to one of the killings to which he has been linked, The Associated Press reported, before he wore his microphone into the bathroom.

That’s when he apparently said to himself, ""There it is. You're caught"" and ""What the hell did I do? Killed them all, of course.""

The six-part HBO series ""The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst"" ended a day after Durst was arrested on a capital murder warrant issued by police in Los Angeles related to the death of his friend, Susan Berman, his attorney said today.

FBI agents believed Durst may have wanted to flee the country, possibly to Cuba, as he registered under an alias at the hotel, paid with cash, and was found with fake documents, said the source. According to nola.com, Saturday marked the first nonstop flight from New Orleans to Cuba since 1958.

The Los Angeles Police Department said today Berman's death has been under investigation since her body was found in her home on Christmas Eve in 2000.

""As a result of investigative leads and additional evidence that has come to light in the past year, investigators have identified Robert Durst as the person responsible for Ms. Berman's death,"" the LAPD said.

Durst appeared before a magistrate Sunday in New Orleans where he was ordered held without bond, according to the Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office. He has an extradition hearing scheduled for Monday.

""We will waive extradition in an attempt to expedite the process of getting into court in LA to answer and defend against the charges,"" Chip Lewis, Robert Durst’s attorney, told ABC News in a statement.

Durst's brother Douglas Durst said in a statement, ""We are relieved and also grateful to everyone who assisted in the arrest of Robert Durst. We hope he will finally be held accountable for all he has done.""

HBO said in a statement, ""We simply cannot say enough about the brilliant job that Andrew Jarecki and Marc Smerling did in producing The Jinx. Years in the making, their thorough research and dogged reporting reignited interest in Robert Durst's story with the public and law enforcement.""

The New York real estate heir has made national headlines as a person of interest or suspect in three deaths since 1982.

Durst has denied killing Berman, but some believed he had a motive, allegedly wanting to silence her about the 1982 disappearance of his first wife, Kathleen Durst, another death he has been investigated for but never charged. Berman was about to meet with investigators in New York about the disappearance of Kathleen Durst before she died.

Kathleen was officially declared dead in 2001, and Durst has said he has no idea what happened to her.

Durst was also charged in the 2001 killing of a neighbor in Galveston, Texas, but he claimed self-defense and was later found not guilty.

Durst, who participated in 25 hours of interviews for the HBO series, declined to comment to ABC News about the series.

Police say Artrai Alexander, 40, robbed a store then carjacked a white Dodge Challenger Wednesday, before leading cops on a high-speed, eight-mile pursuit. The chase ended in a major accident. The Challenger smashed into a minivan being driven by Jessica Liesmann.

Instead of waiting for police to arrive, Liesmann took matters into her own hands. Liesmann and her boyfriend Charles Cook stormed out of the minivan and confronted Alexander, holding onto the straps of his overalls and wrestling him to the ground before officers arrived.

Liesmann, on her way to pick up her daughter and with her 13-year-old son in the back seat, says the crash set off her maternal instinct.

“There’s no thinking, it’s just a reaction,” she said.

""You probably injure my son and you wreck my car, you’re gonna pay.""

Even Liesmann’s boyfriend was stunned by her response.

“I knew she had it in her, but I’m surprised she got out,” Cook said.

Alexander is being charged with aggravated robbery and evading arrest, according to the Dallas Police Department. He is being held on $75,000 bond and has not yet entered a plea, police said."
1EhD0Rt,2015-03-03 00:00:00,Alabama Supreme Court Orders a Stop to Same-Sex Marriage Licenses - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/US/alabama-supreme-court-orders-stop-sex-marriage-licenses/story?id=29369235,"The Alabama Supreme Court handed down a ruling this evening, ordering a stop to the issuance of same-sex marriage licenses by probate judges.

The order comes after the Elmore County's probate judge requested the state's supreme court for further guidance in regards to issuing licenses.

In the ruling, the supreme court cites an effort to comply with Alabama law, which states marriage is between one man and one woman, as the reason to halt same-sex marriage licenses.

""As it has done for approximately two centuries, Alabama law allows for 'marriage' between only one man and one woman,"" the ruling said. ""Alabama probate judges have a ministerial duty not to issue any marriage license contrary to this law. Nothing in the United States Constitution alters or overrides this duty.""

Alabama's probate judges now have five days to file a letter stating why they should not be bound to the court's decision.

The order today comes after a federal appeals court ruled last month against delaying the overturning of Alabama's gay-marriage ban, which U.S. District Judge Callie Granade called unconstitutional.

State Attorney General Luther Strange responded to the appeals court ruling by asking the U.S. Supreme Court for a stay on the marriages until the high court took up the nationwide issue in the spring.

Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore, a vocal opponent of gay marriage, then ordered county probate judges to refuse marriage licenses to gay couples, despite Granade's having ruled that probate judges had a legal duty to issue the licenses.

On Feb. 9, the U.S. Supreme Court opted not to halt the start of the issuance of same-sex marriage licenses in the state, but Moore said he would fight until the justices ruled."
1EhDbsK,2015-03-16 00:00:00,"Why Taking Over the 'Daily Show' Would Be Hard, Even for 'Egypt's Jon Stewart' - ABC News",http://abcnews.go.com/International/taking-daily-show-hard-egypts-jon-stewart/story?id=29652544,"He’s the megastar you might not have heard of: Bassem Youssef is known as “The Jon Stewart of Egypt,” a wildly popular Egyptian political satirist.

Youssef was the face of the groundbreaking show “Al Bernameg,” averaging an audience of 40 million viewers each week and becoming the most-watched show in the history of Egyptian TV.

Could this irreverent Middle Easterner be in line to host “The Daily Show” on Comedy Central? Youssef eschewed the idea, telling ABC News’ David Wright Stewart will leave “huge shoes to fill,” and joking that it would be “the worst rebound ever, like a bad rebound boyfriend for the show.”

But why not Youssef? He already has the seal of approval from Stewart, who has called his pioneering comedy “heroic.” The 40-year-old points to the U.S. audience.

“First of all, I don't think Americans are ready for a Middle Easterner like me to lecture them all on political satire. We need to cross a bridge and then maybe wait another fifty years,” he said. “Like the civil rights movements, they have a black president fifty years later, so we can have a Middle Eastern satirist fifty years from now. At that time I will be ninety years old.”

Despite the fame, Youssef’s show was taken off the air in Egypt. But, he says, not for lack of laughter.

“The whole show was hilarious. People were laughing their asses off,” he said. “I think because we were too funny I think we were banned.”

A cardiac surgeon by trade, Youssef rose to popularity after the Arab Spring.

“I was like a regular everyday-life heart surgeon,” he explained. “And suddenly I had a revolution and they were out on the streets and I was doing my part helping the wounded people of Tahrir Square.”

With the help of a friend, Youssef decided he would “do Jon Stewart on the Internet.” He worked out of his laundry room and says he only expected about 10,000 views – but in mere months, his routine had been seen 5 million times. That led to his television show, and multiple appearances on “The Daily Show.”

In a 2013 appearance, Jon Stewart told Youssef he was “carving out the space for people to breathe and express themselves in a way that I think is incredibly admirable.”

Youssef says his admiration for Stewart goes beyond hero worship, telling ABC News, “This guy is not just an idol, he’s a brother.”

He may not be hosting these days, but Youssef is still plenty busy. He’s a fellow at Harvard’s Institute of Politics and is working on a documentary about satire and free speech in the Middle East, titled ""Tickling Giants.""

But if he were hosting, would he find room for humor in some of the world biggest headlines, including ISIS?

“Look at YouTube in the Middle East. People are making fun of ISIS left right and center.”

Looks like Youssef is well on his way to a second act."

The two hikers were walking along Bear Valley Trail in the Marin County, California, national park Saturday evening when they reached the end of the trail, the Arch Rock overlook, John Dell'Osso, a spokesman for the U.S. National Park Service told ABC station KGO-TV in San Francisco.

The cliff unexpectedly gave way and they fell some 60 feet below, both covered in rubble and rock, Dell'Osso said.

One of the hikers was pronounced deceased at the scene and the other was airlifted to Santa Rosa Memorial Hospital, he said.

Park officials had put up signs at the trailhead Wednesday warning that visitors could not hike out to the end of Bear Valley Trail because a fissure had appeared at the ""tip"" of the overlook, Dell'Osso said.

The park service issued a trail advisory on its website on Thursday warning hikers that fissures along the top of Arch Rock may have weakened it.

""Bluffs along the California coast are inherently unstable. They are prone to crumbling and sliding,"" the website reads. ""It is very dangerous to climb or walk along the edge of cliffs.""

Dell'Osso said park officials even put a 24-inch by 40-inch sign just past the start of the trail to warn visitors of the unstable bluff.

The Marin County coroner's office will release the identity of the decedent pending notification of next of kin, Dell'Osso said."

Carter, who was nominated to the post in December, will replace Chuck Hagel and will be President Obama's fourth defense secretary in six years.

He's a veteran Pentagon official who recently served as Deputy Secretary of Defense from 2011 to 2013 and worked at the Defense Department under President Bill Clinton.

But Carter, 60, also has a unique background one might not expect for a person leading the Pentagon. He's a physicist and medieval historian by training, holding degrees from Yale and Oxford and having taught at Harvard. In 1975, he published an article in Yale Scientific titled “Quarks, Charm and the Psi Particle,"" and his aides once dubbed him the ""600-pound brain in the room.""

Carter earned bipartisan praise throughout his confirmation process. The Senate Armed Services Committee voted unanimously on his nomination after a hearing where he stated his views on providing lethal aid to the Ukrainian military to the mission to defeat ISIS.

""I think Dr. Carter will be a good Secretary of Defense, who will always keep faith with our men and women in uniform and work tirelessly on their behalf and that of our national security,"" Sen. John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services, said today.

""I am hopeful about the prospects of working together with Dr. Carter, along with my colleagues in the Committee on Armed Services, to achieve our shared priorities, especially the reform of our defense acquisition system, the modernization of our military compensation system, and the repeal of sequestration.""

Carter becomes Secretary of Defense as Congress is beginning to debate a request from the White House to authorize the use of military force against ISIS."
1EHuMyO,2015-03-26 00:00:00,"DEA 'Sex Parties' Funded by Drug Cartels, IG Report Says - ABC News",http://abcnews.go.com/US/dea-sex-parties-funded-drug-cartels-ig-report/story?id=29925411,"Senior Drug Enforcement Administration agents working overseas allegedly participated in “sex parties” with prostitutes funded by drug cartels, according to a newly-released Department of Justice Inspector General report on the handling of sexual misconduct allegations by law enforcement agencies.

The conduct occurred over a period of years, according to the report. In addition to soliciting prostitutes, the foreign officers interviewed for the report allege three DEA supervisory special agents were “provided money, expensive gifts, and weapons from drug cartel members.""

Some DEA agents who participated in the parties denied knowing about cartel involvement, but the IG report says “information in the case files suggested they should have known the prostitutes in attendance were paid with cartel funds.”

The sex parties occurred in government leased living quarters where “agents’ laptops, BlackBerry devices and other government-issued equipment were present,” posing a security risk and “potentially exposing them to extortion, blackmail, or coercion.”

In another instance, two DEA special agents allegedly solicited prostitutes for a farewell party for a senior DEA official.

That official, an acting assistant regional director, allegedly had “sexual relations with prostitutes” and there were “allegations operational funds were used to pay for the party and the prostitutes,” according to the report.

The report also alleges that one prostitute was assaulted by someone associated with DEA supervisors following a payment dispute. The report was critical of DEA’s treatment of allegations of sexual misconduct, often dealing with incidents as local management issues and not reporting information up the chain of command.

The report also looked at allegations of misconduct against the U.S. Marshals Service, ATF and the FBI.

One case of alleged sexual harassment involved an FBI “Supervisory Management and Program Analyst’s repeated unprofessional behavior, including cornering his subordinates in their cubicles and displaying the size of his genitals by tightening his pants,” the report details. Subordinates of that employee endured his conduct for 3 years before it was reported to headquarters. The analyst was eventually suspended, demoted and reassigned to another office.

The Department of Justice said in a statement that it is working “with the law enforcement components to ensure a zero tolerance policy on sexual harassment and misconduct is enforced and that incidents are properly reported."""
1Ei4BzG,2015-02-18 00:00:00,Officials Fear Syrian Refugees Could Pose Threat to US - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/International/officials-fear-syrian-refugees-pose-threat-us/story?id=28930114,"Top U.S. counterterrorism officials say they worry a potential terrorist could be hiding among refugees who are looking to come to the United States after escaping the brutal war in Syria.

""It's clearly a population of concern,” the director of the National Counterterrorism Center, Nicholas Rasmussen, told the House Homeland Security Committee on Wednesday.

Committee Chairman Mike McCaul, R-Texas, went further, saying it would be a “huge mistake” to bring refugees from the conflict to the U.S. – even as an estimated 4 million children, women and men have been forced to flee Syria and another 7 million have been displaced from their homes there, unable to leave.

Senior officials leading the State Department’s refugee efforts say the U.S. government has a long history of caring for the innocent victims of war.

“It’s not a matter of should we do it, it’s really a matter of how we do it,” Larry Bartlett, the State Department’s director of Refugee Admission for the Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration, told ABC News. “One of the fundamental principles of our country is that we care about others. We will help others.”

Bartlett insisted every refugee is vetted through an “intensive” system, drawing on information and expertise from several U.S. intelligence agencies, including the Defense Department.

“We have a very slow process of moving refugees through our pipeline, and part of it is because of the security vetting component,” Bartlett said.

Homeland security officials also testified Wednesday that any potential refugees from Syria would receive “the most rigorous screening.”

""Any tasking we're given ... will be as thorough as we can make it,"" said Francis Taylor, the head of the Department of Homeland Security’s intelligence office.

Yet that’s not reassurance enough for McCaul and other leading Republicans, who recently penned a letter to National Security Advisor Susan Rice cautioning that the U.S. government’s ability to screen refugees from Syria might not be sufficient.

“The continued civil war and destabilization in Syria undeniably make it more difficult to acquire the information needed to conduct reliable threat assessments on specific refugees,” they wrote in the letter two weeks ago.

With tens of thousands of Syrians joining groups in the region like the Islamic State, the U.S. government “cannot allow the refugee process to become a backdoor for jihadists,” they added.

At the hearing Wednesday, an FBI official also questioned whether the U.S. intelligence community – with few assets on the ground in Syria and little insight into the country from elsewhere – can provide authorities with the information they need to properly determine whether any refugee could pose a threat.

""You have to have information to vet,” said FBI Assistant Director Michael Steinbach, who heads the bureau’s counterterrorism division. “Databases don't [have] the information on those individuals, and that's the concern.”"
1EIhJje,2015-03-23 00:00:00,5 Ancient Grains You Need to Try - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Health/ancient-grains/story?id=29795721,"The hottest new food trend is actually pretty old. Way, way old. The same whole grains grown by ancient Egyptians, Ethiopians, Aztecs, and Incas are shaking up the 21st century as they’re now appearing in staples like Cheerios and Chobani yogurt, with many more products expected to hit the shelves in 2015.

Here are five grains from long ago that you need to know about, plus what to do with each one.

Don’t let amaranth’s tiny size fool you. The Peruvian native is high in protein (nearly double the amount in brown rice), and offers all of the essential amino acids your body can’t make on its own—so it’s a complete protein, like meat, poultry, and eggs. It’s technically a seed, so it’s naturally gluten-free, and a perfect addition to vegan and gluten-free diets.

Try it: Pop it like popcorn in a hot, dry skillet and mix it into freshly baked granola, or stir into melted dark chocolate and freeze in mini muffin tins for a sweet, single-serve dessert.

Millet was actually Asia’s staple grain before rice more than 10,000 years ago. These days, you may be more familiar with it as birdseed. It’s gluten-free and high in antioxidants and magnesium, which research suggests may help prevent and manage high blood pressure, heart disease, and diabetes. Since 60% of adults in the United States don’t consume the recommended amount of magnesium, millet may be just what’s missing from your healthy diet.

Try it: Serve up millet porridge instead of oatmeal or toast it in a hot skillet to bring out its nutty flavor. Sprinkle toasted grains on fresh fruit and yogurt, cereal, or salads.

Spelt is a type of wheat that was pushed aside during industrialization because it was harder to grow than the wheat that’s popular now. It’s rumored that wheat-sensitive people are better able to tolerate spelt, but because it contains gluten, it’s not safe for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. One cup of cooked whole spelt is high in fiber (helpful for weight management) and a good source of iron for vegetarians.

Try it: If you don’t like the bitter flavor of whole wheat in baked goods like muffins, you may prefer spelt flour’s sweeter, nuttier bite and lighter texture. Or toss cooked spelt berries into salads for a more filling lunch. Look for “whole spelt” on the label to ensure you’re getting the whole grain, not a refined version.

If you’ve ever tried Ethiopian food, you’ve had teff, which is used to make their famous spongy injera bread. It’s surprisingly high in calcium, with one cup containing as much as a half-cup of cooked spinach. Teff can also help with weight management: it’s rich in a type of fiber called resistant starch, which helps you feel more satisfied, feeds your healthy gut bacteria, and doesn’t raise blood sugar levels.

Try it: This gluten-free grain has a mildly sweet flavor (injera only tastes sour because it’s made with fermented teff), and makes a delicious hot cereal similar to farina. You can also substitute whole grain teff flour for ¼ of the all-purpose flour in a recipe.

An ancient cousin of modern wheat, kamut has 20-40% more protein and a sweeter, more buttery flavor. If you suffer from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a small 2014 study in the British Journal of Nutrition found that subjects eating products made with organic, semi-whole grain kamut reported a significant decrease in the severity of IBS symptoms like abdominal pain and bloating than when they ate products made with semi-whole grain modern wheat. Blood tests revealed reduced inflammation after the kamut intervention, but not after the modern wheat period.
Try it: Use whole grain kamut flour to make healthy pancakes, bread, and other baked goods or toss cooked kamut berries into a stir-fry or salad. There are many ready-to-eat products made with kamut already on the market like breakfast cereal, granola, and pasta.

1EIu2ff,2015-03-24 00:00:00,'Pretty Woman' Turns 25: How It Would Be Different Today - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/pretty-woman-turns-25-today/story?id=29735476,"Ready to feel old?

""Pretty Woman"" hit theaters 25 years ago today.

For those of you who haven't seen the film, here's a quick recap: Richard Gere stars as Edward Lewis, a hard-nosed businessman who hires a sassy, but unpolished, prostitute named Vivian (played by Julia Roberts) to attend social functions with him while he negotiates an important business deal. With the help of the friendly Beverly Wilshire Hotel manager Barnard (Hector Elizondo), Vivian gets a complete makeover and learns proper etiquette, ultimately winning over Edward, with whom she falls in love. Cue a homeless man wandering around, encouraging everybody to follow their dreams and Roy Orbison crooning ""Pretty Woman.""

In a lot of ways, it's a formula we've seen a lot over the years. However, there are a few choice moments in ""Pretty Woman"" that aren't as plausible now as they were back in 1990. Here are a few, below:

1. Edward meets Vivian: Edward first meets Vivian when he stops to ask her directions to his hotel. Ultimately, he let her drive his car there. This would never happen today. First of all, Edward would absolutely have access to a GPS system, or, at the very least, a mapping function on his phone, so it's unlikely that he would have gotten lost in the first place. And, if he did, he'd call for help. He wouldn't ask a random person on the street for directions.

2. Edward drives a Lotus: Lotus is mostly known for race cars these days. In a modern version of ""Pretty Woman,"" maybe Edward would drive a Tesla and be in need of a charging station.

3. ""You're on my fax"": That's an actual sentence that Edward says to Vivian. Shortly thereafter, we learn that he has a cell phone the size of his head and does not appear to use a laptop. None of this stands the test of time, but the quote does have a certain ring to it!

4. Vivian listens to Prince on her Walkman while taking a bath: Prince's ""Kiss"" may be timeless, but sadly, Walkmans are not. Vivian would be listening to music -- or maybe a podcast -- on her phone. (She could get into ""Serial,"" right?)

5. Edward hires Vivian for the week: Edward, a busy man in the middle of a big business deal, needs someone to accompany him to a week's worth of social events, so he hires Vivian to do the job. After all, times were tough in 1990: You had to go out, meet someone in real life, and then take her on a date before proposing something like that. Today, Edward could simplify things: He could download Tinder, swipe right a few times, and voila! He's set.

6. ""You really should think about traveler's checks"": That's the advice Vivian gives to Edward when he hands her a stack of cash for a new wardrobe. There are people today who don't even know what a traveler's check is. A simpler way to go would have been what he did later: give her his card.

7. Vivian is turned away from a store on Rodeo Drive: In one of the film's most famous scenes, Vivian, still in her street clothes, is humiliated when saleswomen at an upscale boutique refuses to help her. The next day, after having better luck at another store, a glammed up-Vivian walks back into the first shop to confront her bullies. ""You work on commission, right?"" she asks them, waving her shopping bags in their faces. ""Big mistake. Big. Huge."" These days, it's unlikely anyone would bat an eye at her original outfit -- a short skirt and cropped top. After all, some stars wear those looks on the red carpet!

8. Vivian goes on shopping spree: Vivian finally goes on a shopping spree, shown in the film as a montage set to ""Pretty Woman."" It seems more likely that today, a stylist would come to the hotel armed with everything she'd need. And when they ordered her pizza? Forget it. 1990's ""Who ordered pizza?"" is today's, ""Who ordered kale salad and green juices?!""

9. Edward tells Vivian not to answer the phone: Vivian would have a cell phone, which she probably would have used to get an Uber car to take her home from the hotel in the first place, but that's neither here nor there. Either way, if Edward wanted to get a hold of her, he could text her, or call her cell phone. She probably wouldn't even think to answer the phone in the hotel room.

10. Vivian whoops at the polo match: By 1990, Arsenio Hall had popularized whooping and first pumping, which was how Vivian reacted to a polo match. Now she'd probably just snap a selfie to prove how excited she was to be there.

11. Edward's lawyer's wife is described as an ""aerobics queen"": Edward's lawyer Philip Stuckey (played by Jason Alexander) remarks that his wife is an ""aerobics queen"" after she runs off to catch up with a friend from ""Workout World."" In 2015, Elizabeth Stuckey would be into SoulCycle.

12. Kit and Vivian share an emotional goodbye: As Vivian packs up her things to move to San Francisco, Kit, her roommate, nostalgically looks old photos and gives her a big hug. Today, Kit would be flipping through her Instagram page, and the goodbye would be less depressing, because they'd probably be texting and Facetiming within hours."
1EJSkDd,2015-03-29 00:00:00,John Kerry Orders Email Preservation Review at State Department - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/john-kerry-orders-email-preservation-review-state-department/story?id=29961803,"Secretary of State John Kerry sent a letter to the State Department’s Inspector General requesting a review of email and records management, the State Department said today.

The timing of Kerry’s request has many asking if this push for reform is connected to former Secretary Hillary Clinton’s recent scandal involving her use of a private email server, rather than a State Department account.

State Department Spokesman Jeff Rathke denied this had anything to do with Clinton, citing instead the State Department’s need to better manage the overwhelming number of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests and requests for information from Congress.

But in his letter, Kerry mentions the need to “keep pace with changes in technology” and specifically mentions the use of personal email.

“We are also facing challenges regarding our integration of record keeping technologies and the use of non-government systems by some Department personnel to conduct official business,” Kerry wrote.

Clinton has admitted she only used a personal account when it came to conducting business over email.

Rathke insists that the Inspector General has been instructed to look at changes going forward and not at any specific cases, including Clinton’s.

Still, the letter goes on to ask the Inspector General a series of questions, many of which could apply directly to Clinton’s current dilemma.

For example, question number 1: ""How are the changes in technology and the way the State Department personnel work challenging existing preservation and transparency technologies and policies, especially with respect to email?""

Clinton’s detractors say her exclusive use of private email resulted in her being the sole arbiter when determining which emails needed to be saved and which could be deleted.

And there’s question number 4: “How can the Department improve its tools and methods for complying with the FOIA and other requests to search for and produce documents from both current and former employees?""

After she left office the Select Committee investigating the Benghazi terror attacks requested all of Clinton’s emails relating to Benghazi and Libya during her tenure as Secretary and now claims it wants to see her private server to make sure she has complied.

Kerry is asking for an “expedited review"" of these issues."
1EkbPHd,2015-03-06 00:00:00,Hillary Clinton Was in Violation of State Dept. Policy for Nearly 6 Years - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/hillary-clinton-violation-state-dept-policy-years/story?id=29424270,"Hillary Clinton was in violation of State Department rules governing the use of non-governmental email accounts during her entire tenure as secretary of state and for nearly two years after she left the job, ABC News has learned.

A senior State Department official tells ABC News that under rules in place while Clinton was secretary of state, employees could only use private email accounts for official business if they turned those emails over to be entered into government computers. They were also forbidden from including sensitive but unclassified information on private email, except under some very narrow exceptions.

This policy is still in place, according to the Department. Until any private emails are entered into government computers, the official says, an employee is in violation of the rules.

Clinton used a private email account for her entire tenure as secretary -- and did not even have a government-issued email. She only turned over some 55,000 pages of emails to be entered into government computer systems late last year, nearly two years after she stepped down from the State Department.

It is also likely that some of Mrs. Clinton's emails contained information ""sensitive but unclassified"" as defined by the federal government, a senior State Department official acknowledged, in potential violation of the 2005 department regulation as codified in the Foreign Affairs Manual (FAM).

""Reports claiming that by using personal email [Clinton] is automatically out of step of that FAM are inaccurate,"" the official told ABC News in a statement. ""We are not going to prejudge the outcome of the review of Secretary Clinton's 55000 pages of emails.""

A spokesman for Clinton did not respond to ABC News' repeated requests for comment.

If Clinton has now turned over all emails related to official business, she would be in compliance with State Department rules, an official said. But there is no way to independently verify that she has done that.

Clinton’s spokesman said earlier this week that she has turned over about 90 percent of the emails she wrote as secretary of state, withholding only those that were strictly personal and not covered by the policy.

State Department email rules became an issue while Clinton was secretary of state.

One of Clinton’s ambassadors was criticized by the department’s inspector general in a 2012 report for using private email.

“It is the department’s general policy that normal day-to-day operations be conducted on an authorized information system, which has the proper level of security controls,” the Office of Inspector General wrote in the 2012 report, referencing the Foreign Affairs Manual provision dating to 2005.

The IG report warned that the use of non-governmental email accounts “increases the risk” of security breaches and the “loss of official public records as these systems do not have approved record preservation or backup functions.”

Clinton is believed to have established her own private email network based out of her Chappaqua, New York, home, where aides say she has personally preserved all messages before turning them over."

But the ""camouflage was ineffective,"" the spokesman said.

The suspect, Jose Espinoza, 23, was arrested on Saturday night facing charges of possession of stolen property and theft of a vehicle, the spokesman said.

Espinoza fled the first time police arrived at his house, but he was successfully apprehended when he later returned to his home and was allegedly seen with black spray paint on his face, the spokesman said.

The spray paint bottle Espinoza allegedly used has been turned over as evidence, he added.

WHAT A JOKE. That sl-- got rocked by Nevada.""

Davis told ""SportsCenter"" on Monday that she wrote an email to the school asking officials to reinstate Casselberry.

""Everyone makes mistakes,"" Davis said. ""Everyone deserves a second chance. I know he didn't mean it in that type of way. I know people get tired of seeing me on TV. But sometimes you got to think about what you're doing before you do it.

""It hurt on my part, but he hurt even more. If it was me, I would want to take that back. I know how hard he's worked. Why not give him a second chance?""

The university released a statement to the media Monday confirming that Davis had reached out.

""Her request demonstrates the type of person she is, her level of maturity and the empathy that her family and coach teach her,"" its statement read. ""Bloomsburg University stands firm on our decision; however, his consequences will be reviewed as is common in disciplinary actions like this.""

Davis, from Philadelphia, was the first girl to earn a win and pitch a shutout in the LLWS last summer. She also appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated.

Last week the Disney Channel said development is underway on the biographical film titled ""Throw Like Mo.""

1EkSvIh,2015-03-04 00:00:00,What You Need to Know About the Challenge to Obamacare in Supreme Court - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/obamacare-subsidies-supreme-court-hears-major-challenge/story?id=29351654,"The Affordable Care Act, a.k.a. Obamacare, dodged a bullet in 2012 when the Supreme Court upheld the individual mandate. Wednesday, it faces a second major legal challenge; this one to the taxpayer-funded premium subsidies that underpin the entire law.

The nine justices will hear arguments over whether it’s legal to give out the subsidies in 34 states where the federal government established and runs the insurance exchanges, HealthCare.gov.

The stakes are high: About 7.5 million Americans have received subsidies to purchase health insurance coverage in those 34 states.

If the court strikes them down, the “vast majority” will be forced out of coverage almost immediately because their premiums will become prohibitively expensive, experts say.

""There could be chaos,"" said Abbe Gluck, a Yale Law School professor who specializes in health law.

An average American receiving Obamacare subsidies pays just $105 a month out of pocket for insurance, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Take away the aid and the cost spikes to $373 a month – for many, a price out of reach.

“The horror stories will be real,” Republican Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska warned in the Wall Street Journal. “Chemotherapy turned off for perhaps 12,000 people, dialysis going dark for 10,000.”

Experts are also sounding alarm bells about a broader impact: the upending of individual insurance markets and a likely “death spiral.” Premiums would skyrocket for everyone in those 34 states, not just those who purchased Obamacare, a study in the New England Journal of Medicine found.

And if you think the states, Congress or the Department of Health and Human Services could enact a quick, even temporary, fix, then think again. There has been little-to-no preparation for a court decision striking the subsidies down.

“We’ll have to wait and see what the Supreme Court decides,” President Obama told Reuters Monday. “If they rule against us, we’ll have to take a look at what our options are.”

There will be just 25 days to look at those options after the court releases its opinion, which is expected in June, leaving precious little time for lawmakers and those relying on subsidized Obamacare insurance to act to come up with an alternative plan."

""What was intended as a message of inclusion was interpreted as a message of exclusion, especially for the LGBT community,"" Indiana House Speaker Brian Bosma told reporters at a 9 a.m. news conference. ""Nothing could have been further from the truth, but it was clear the perception had to be addressed.""

The new language will still have to be approved by Indiana's legislature and signed by the state's Republican governor, Mike Pence, before it goes into effect. Pence this week announced he would support changing the law.

Bosma and Senate President Pro Tem David Long appeared with business leaders from Indiana, claiming a broad agreement on how to change the law. The two extended an apology to citizens -- not for the law they passed, but for how it was interpreted.

""I had a chance to sit down with Greg Louganis for about an hour, just visiting,"" Bosma said of the Olympic diver who is openly gay. ""He shared with me the personal hurt that he felt when he heard the incorrect message that Indiana supported discrimination.""

Bosma said he ""extended an apology to him, not for actions taken, but for messages received. ... I personally extend that apology to anyone who received that same message.""

The NCAA, which is based in Indiana and will hold the men's basketball Final Four in Indianapolis on Saturday, was an early critic of the law. On Thursday morning, it voiced support for the ""fix.""

""We are very pleased the Indiana legislature is taking action to amend Senate Bill 101 so that it is clear individuals cannot be discriminated against,"" NCAA President Mark Emmert said in a written statement. ""NCAA core values call for an environment that is inclusive and non-discriminatory for our student-athletes, membership, fans, staff and their families. We look forward to the amended bill being passed quickly and signed into law expeditiously by the governor.""

The proposed change was met with condemnation from conservative activist Eric Miller, who founded the group Advance America and has spoken out against Christian florists, bakers and photographers being required to serve gay weddings even if they claim religious objections to doing so.

""This bill is worse than no bill at all,"" Miller told ABC News.

Signed by Pence last week, the state's ""Religious Freedom Restoration Act"" states that a higher threshold must be met before a law is upheld where it infringes on the free exercise of religion by people or businesses -- between those private entities or where the government is involved.

Both critical gay-rights activists and supportive social conservatives have said the law would mean Christian wedding vendors would not be required to serve gay couples getting married. A wave of national backlash ensued, including wide condemnation from large businesses and organizations based in or hosting events in Indiana.

The Yelp! listing for an Indiana pizza restaurant became an Internet sensation on Wednesday, after the restaurant said it would not serve pizza at a gay wedding if asked.

Although Pence initially insisted the law would not change, Bosma and Long announced on Monday that they would change the law to preclude denial of services for gays and lesbians by Indiana businesses."

The Supreme Court justice said her imbibing may have been part of the reason why she was caught on camera apparently falling asleep at the televised address.

""The audience, for the most part is awake, because they’re bobbing up and down, and we sit there, stone-faced, sober judges. But we’re not, at least I wasn't, 100 percent sober,"" she said Thursday night during a talk hosted by the Smithsonian Associates in D.C., according to The Blaze.

The 81-year-old said that she wasn't responsible for bringing the booze. Rather, it was another of the country's top judges.

""Before we went to the State of the Union, Justice Kennedy brought in ... it was an Opus something or other, very fine California wine, and I vowed this year, just sparkling water, stay away from the wine,"" Ginsburg reportedly said. ""But in the end, the dinner was so delicious, it needed wine.""

Cameras within House chamber caught Ginsburg nodding off, and she was alerted to it by an eagle-eyed relative.

""So I got a call when I came home from one of my granddaughters and she said, 'Bubbe, you were sleeping at the State of the Union!'"" Ginsburg said at Thursday night's talk.

It wasn't the first time that Ginsburg, who is the subject of an online meme that dubbed her ""Notorious RBG,"" a play on rapper The Notorious B.I.G.'s a similar nickname, was seen dozing off during the annual speech.

She was caught nearly doubled over in 2014.

And, speaking in 2013, she blamed ""a very good California wine that Tony Kennedy brought"" to a dinner before the 2012 State of the Union for that year's catnap, according to The Washington Post."

Twenty-five people on board the Air Canada A320 were injured in the hard landing after the jet hit an array antenna on the ground. Considering the considerable damage to the plane, it was fortunate that no one was seriously hurt, officials said.

""They touched down 1,100 feet before the runway,"" Michael Cunningham of the Transportation Safety Board of Canada said. ""I'd say they are pretty lucky.""

The landing gear came off after the plane hit the runway, according to Cunningham, and the plane then skidded another 1,100 feet on its belly before it came to a stop. The passengers were then evacuated, Cunningham said.

""Didn't hesitate -- just jumped out onto the wing, we started running away from the plane,"" passenger Dominic Stettler said.

The underside of the plane suffered significant damage, Cunningham said. The nose cone broke off and one of the plane's two engines detached.

""I was really scared,"" Leon Yu said. ""We slid down a thing, and we saw the engine a couple hundred feet from the plane.""

Of the 25 passengers and crew members who were hospitalized, all but one had been released as of Sunday afternoon, according to Air Canada.

The TSB will have about 12 to 15 investigators at the scene on Monday.

""It's too early to draw any conclusions about this occurrence,"" Cunningham said this afternoon.

The black boxes have been recovered and are heading to Ottawa to be analyzed, Cunningham said.

Halifax Stanfield International Airport spokesman Peter Spurway said the pilots were in control of the plane up until the hard landing.

Spurway said there was snow on the runway but it hadn't yet been determined whether that was a factor in the hard landing. The airport also suffered a power interruption around the same time of the incident, but it was unclear whether the two events were related.

""It was safe to land in this weather,"" said Air Canada Chief Operating Officer Klaus Goersch.

The pilots are 15-year veterans of Air Canada, Goersch added, with ""many years"" of experience flying the A320.

Goersch said that the plane was checked Saturday, which was its most recent scheduled maintenance check.

The airport was closed to all air traffic for several hours after the crash before reopening.

Again, operations are resuming. Expect changes to flight schedules, please check ahead."

Flight 1074, en route to Denver, returned to Dulles International Airport shortly after takeoff late Monday. The pilots told air traffic controllers the passenger became violent but was restrained by passengers, according to LiveATC.net.

""He ran forward towards the cockpit and he is being restrained by passengers,"" one of the pilots said. ""Cockpit is secure and we would like to return to the airport and have the authorities meet him.""

Donna Tellam, a passenger on board the flight, said two men grabbed him and held him down.

""One held his feet and the other one kind of laid on top of him and then the flight attendants went and got some plastic restraints for his arms,"" she said. “At one point when his head was down he said there were jihadists in the cargo hold and he did say jihad a couple times.""

Law enforcement in Washington met the plane at the gate and detained the passenger, according to a statement from United Airlines. He was taken to a hospital for an evaluation, an airport spokesman said.

United Airlines planned to fly the remaining passengers to Denver this morning."

1ELPJhu,2015-04-03 00:00:00,Iran Nuclear Deal: Tentative Deal Reached - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/iran-nuclear-deal-announcement-expected/story?id=29952510,"After eight straight days of high-level diplomatic negotiations between six world powers and Iran, negotiators in Lausanne, Switzerland, announced an interim agreement has been reached on the principles for dismantling Iran's nuclear program in exchange for lifting heavy economic sanctions.

""Today we have taken a decisive step,"" said Federica Mogherini, the High Representative of the European Union, responsible for coordinating the talks. ""We have reached solutions on key parameters of a joint comprehensive plan of action.""

“This has been a long time coming,” Obama said.

Mogherini outlined some specifics about the interim deal in a the news conference, standing alongside Iran's foreign minister.

Among the agreements:

Iran's deep-buried nuclear facility at Fordo will be converted from a a nuclear site into a physics and technology center. No fissile material will remain there. Iran has agreed not to enrich uranium over 3.67 percent for at least 15 years and to reduce its current stockpile of about 10,000 Kg of low-enriched uranium to 300 Kg (a 98% reduction) for 15 years. It's stockpile of enriched uranium will have to be either diluted or sold in the international marketplace.

The heavy water reactor at Arak will be redesigned and will not produce weapons-grade plutonium that could be used to make a bomb.

Iran’s breakout timeline -- the time that it would take for Iran to acquire enough fissile material for one weapon -- would be increased from 2 to 3 months to at least one year for a duration of 10 years. Iran has also agreed to not build any new facilities for the purpose of enriching uranium for 15 years.

In return, many of the United Nations and European nuclear-related economic sanctions against Iran will be lifted immediately following verification that Iran has taken the steps agreed upon steps to dismantle its nuclear hardware. Other sanctions, including those approved by Congress, will be lifted in a phased approach.

""If Iran cheats, the world will know it. If we see something suspicious, we will inspect it,"" President Obama said. ""With this deal, Iran will face more inspections than any other country in the world.""

Moments before the news conference, Iranian leaders, including President Hassan Rouhani and Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, released short statements via Twitter today that ""solutions on key parameters"" have been ""reached"" and that negotiators are ready to begin drafting an agreement.

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry tweeted moments after the Iranians that negotiators ""now have parameters to resolve major issues"" on Iran's nuclear program. ""Back to work soon on a final deal,"" Kerry wrote.

Big day: #EU, P5+1, and #Iran now have parameters to resolve major issues on nuclear program. Back to work soon on a final deal.

""We have said from the beginning -- and I think you've heard me say it again and again -- that we will not accept just any deal, that we will only accept a good deal,"" Kerry said later, speaking at a solo press conference in Lausanne. ""And today, I can tell you that the political understanding, with details, that we have reached is a solid foundation for the good deal that we are seeking.""

Although the outline presented in Lausanne does not represent the final stage of the deal, it is the most significant step yet towards a nuclear accord with Iran and marks a major milestone in diplomatic relations with Iran, which have been in a deep freeze for over 35 years.

Negotiators now have to begin drafting a more detailed, formal agreement with a goal to have it signed by all parties by the end of June.

Negotiators on all sides have been working to get to this point since November 2013. That's when Iran and the so-called P5+1 (U.S., U.K., France, Russia, China plus Germany) agreed on a Joint Plan of Action, an interim agreement that paved the way for talks by temporarily halting Iran's nuclear enrichment program and subjecting it to daily inspections in exchange for the loosening of some economic sanctions.

But the Obama administration's most difficult negotiations may occur back in Washington, where just two weeks ago, 367 members of Congress, many of them Democrats, signed a letter expressing ""grave and urgent"" concern over the Iran nuclear negotiations.

""So when you hear the inevitable critics of the deal sound off, ask them a simple question,"" President Obama said, addressing his detractors in Congress. ""Do you really think that this verifiable deal, if fully implemented, backed by the world's major powers, is a worse option than the risk of another war in the Middle East?""

Though Congress does not have to sign off on an executive-level agreement, it could seek to derail the accord by voting to enact tougher economic sanctions on Iran. President Obama has threatened to veto that legislation, but it's possible Congress could get the two-thirds majority needed to override a presidential veto.

Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Arkansas, a fierce critic of the Iran negotiations and author of the now-infamous congressional letter to Iran's supreme leader, wasted no time saying he rejects this most recent agreement and will work with his colleagues to ""stop this deal from going forward.""

""This deal is going to threaten America's national security interests and it's going to lead to a nuclear arms race in the most volatile region in the world,"" Cotton said in an interview with ABC News today.

The Butler County Sheriff’s Office posted an alert on Facebook Tuesday about Andrew Dale Marcum, 21, who was wanted on a range of charges, including burglary (safe-cracking), abduction, assault and domestic violence.

Residents commented on the post. So did Marcum, apparently.

“I ain’t tripping half of them don’t even know me,” Marcum wrote from his Facebook account.

The sheriff’s office responded: “If you could stop by the Sheriff’s Office, that’d be great.”

County Sheriff Richard K. Jones also weighed in, posting a photo on Twitter showing a jail cell.

“Hey Andrew Marcum we’ve got your room ready ...” Jones wrote.

“Andrew Dale Marcum will be off Facebook temporarily, because there is no social media access in the Butler County Jail. He's turned himself in,” the office wrote in a new Facebook post. “Thanks to our Facebook and Twitter friends for helping turn up the heat.”"

The online message board is adopting new privacy guidelines months after private nude photos that were stolen from celebrities were posted on the Internet message board.

For nearly a decade, Reddit has been everything from a conduit for intelligent conversation to a dumping ground for questionable content. When it comes to cracking down on users, Reddit has long been averse to rules and, instead, let its millions-strong community police the boards.

Announcing a new  privacy policy today, the site's executive team wrote, ""Last year, we missed a chance to be a leader in social media when it comes to protecting your privacy -- something we've cared deeply about since reddit's inception.""

Effective March 10, Reddit users will no longer be allowed to post sexually explicit photos without the subject's consent. Anyone with an issue can flag a photo to expedite its removal.

""No matter who you are, if a photograph, video, or digital image of you in a state of nudity, sexual excitement, or engaged in any act of sexual conduct, is posted or linked to on reddit without your permission, it is prohibited on reddit,"" the company's executive team wrote. ""We also recognize that violent personalized images are a form of harassment that we do not tolerate and we will remove them when notified.""

Reddit said it will keep data on how many photos it removes and will share the number in its annual privacy report.

The company removed a thread containing the stolen celebrity photos last year. However, then-CEO Yishan Wong said although Reddit was sympathetic to the celebrities whose stolen photos were posted, it was ""unlikely to make changes to our existing site content policies in response to this specific event."""
1EOjyKH,2015-02-24 00:00:00,Trayvon Martin: DOJ Announces No Charges Against George Zimmerman - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/US/trayvon-martin-doj-announces-charges-george-zimmerman/story?id=29186648,"While the public waits for a Justice Department announcement over two separate investigations spurred by the summer shooting of an unarmed teenager in Ferguson, Missouri, the department announced today it is closing its investigation into the killing of Trayvon Martin.

Justice Department officials met with Martin's family today, and were told that they will not be filing charges against George Zimmerman, who shot the 17-year-old after a confrontation in 2012. Thursday marks three years to the day since Martin was killed.

Federal prosecutors concluded there is not sufficient evidence to prove Zimmerman, a neighborhood watchman in Sanford, Fla., intentionally violated Martin's civil rights.

""Although the department has determined that this matter cannot be prosecuted federally, it is important to remember that this incident resulted in the tragic loss of a teenager's life,"" Acting Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta of the Civil Rights Division said. ""Our decision not to pursue federal charges does not condone the shooting that resulted in the death of Trayvon Martin and is based solely on the high legal standard applicable to these cases.""
The case sparked intense discussions over race in America because Martin was walking to his home with only Skittles and an iced tea in his hands.

Florida prosecutors tried to convict Zimmerman of state-level murder and manslaughter charges, but in July 2013 a jury acquitted him, saying prosecutors didn't have enough evidence to prove their case.

One juror -– the only minority on the all-female jury –- later told ABC News that ""as the law was read to me, if you have no proof that he killed him intentionally, you can't say he's guilty.""

""You can't put the man in jail even though in our hearts we felt he was guilty,"" she said. ""But we had to grab our hearts and put it aside and look at the evidence.""

In Sanford, race-related tensions had been simmering for nearly a century, but Martin's death ""was the proverbial 'straw that broke the camel's back,'"" bringing ""those issues to the surface,"" the new Sanford police chief, Cecil Smith, recently told federal officials.

After Martin was killed, Holder sat down his own teenage son to explain that -- as unfair as it may be -- young black men must often interact with police in a different way than others, he told a convention in April 2014. It was ""a conversation I hoped I'd never have to have,"" Holder added.

As media attention mounted over Martin's death, protests grew across the country calling for justice. The city of Sanford now says a police department had not been scrutinized like that by the press, religious organizations, social activists and the broader public since Los Angeles police beat Rodney King in 1991.

Zimmerman was not a police officer and the neighborhood watch program he was a part of was independent from local police.

Many accused Zimmerman of discriminating against Martin –- essentially taking action against the teenager and ultimately killing him because Martin was black. Zimmerman is Hispanic.

The Justice Department's Civil Rights Division and FBI opened an investigation into the case, noting ""experienced federal prosecutors"" would determine ""whether the evidence reveals a prosecutable violation"" of federal law. In a statement, the department noted there are ""limited federal criminal civil rights statutes within our jurisdiction.""

Privately and publicly, Justice Department officials have been telegraphing all along that they were unlikely to file charges against Zimmerman. And in November 2013, Holder said the case against Zimmerman ""in substantial part was resolved"" with his acquittal months earlier.

Nevertheless, federal officials have insisted their civil-rights probe would be thorough and complete. Several months ago –- nearly two years into the Justice Department's investigation –- Holder said federal investigators were still seeking to interview certain witnesses ""as a result of some recent developments.""

More recently, Holder has said he hoped to announce the findings of the Zimmerman and Ferguson-related probes before he leaves office, which could happen in a matter of weeks, depending on when the U.S. Senate confirms his successor.

Holder has said then when a decision is announced in the Zimmerman case, it will be accompanied by ""as much information"" as possible detailing the Justice Department's findings.

In the Ferguson case, the department is currently conducting two probes into the matter.

A criminal investigation will try to determine whether then-officer Darren Wilson used unreasonable force and intentionally violated Michael Brown's civil rights when he shot the unarmed teenager in August. The second probe - though not criminal in nature –- will look more broadly into whether the Ferguson police department has routinely engaged in a ""pattern or practice"" of unlawful and discriminatory policing.

A state grand jury in Ferguson, Missouri, declined to indict Wilson in Novembe4 2014. Many expect the Justice Department will not be able to bring federal charges against Wilson, but will take action against the local police department.

Known for decimating the European population in the middle ages, the Black Death was caused by the bacterium yersinia pestis, which somehow made its way from Asia to Europe in 1347, according to the study published today in the journal PNAS.

Study co-author Nils Stenseth, a biologist at the University of Oslo, said that 12 to 15 years before the plague hit Europe, Asia experienced a warm spring and wet summer, which is good for the gerbils and fleas that carried the plague. Then, a drought decimated the gerbil population, forcing the plague toward domestic animal and human hosts, he said. It then made its way to Europe, though the vessel is unclear, Stenseth said.

Stenseth and his team determined the climate hundreds of years ago by examining tree growth rings, according to the study. The authors wrote that a better approach would be to study the DNA gleaned from the remains of plague victims.

Epidemiologist Dr. Bill Schaffner, chair of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, said he found the study ""intriguing"" because he'd never before heard of an animal other than the rat being blamed for the Black Death. But he said the authors are doing a lot of inferring to come to their conclusions.

""My bottom line is that this is a fascinating new thesis,"" said Schaffner, who was not involved in the study. ""And I think that it likely will result in a lot of controversy among people who are disease historians.""

But your pet gerbil won't give you the plague, Stenseth. The animals that spread the plague in Asia was actually a separate, wild species known as a great gerbil, Stenseth said."

Smart home gadgets are poised to be the next big things—sales of smart gadgets are expected to exceed 36 million units in the next two years, according to Park Associates Research Firm.

But can the technology used to turn our homes into wireless nerve centers stand up to the challenge?

Tech writer Stacey Higginbotham lives in a “smart home” in Texas. Her devices and appliances are all connected to each other and to the Internet, which means she can control them remotely from her phone.

Her side door is wired to a keypad -- though Higginbotham still carries keys with her in case the keypad goes on the fritz. Her gadgets are voice activated. She has a robotic vacuum cleaner, a touch-sensitive kitchen sink and window shades that close on command. She has an app that will open and close her garage door, and even alert her if she left it open, and then close it for her from miles away. Even her light bulbs are “smart,” and could be set to all sorts of colors from “deep sea” to “sunset.”

“You have to buy a starter kit with three light bulbs and a little bridge that you plug into the router and that’s $200, and each additional light bulb is $60,” Higginbotham said, noting the bulbs last 22 years. ""They’re LEDS. They save you energy.”

Higginbotham also has a wearable device that looks like a ring on her finger called “Ringly,” which can alert her when she has a call or a text, among other things.

But while living in a smart home has its perks, not all the features in Higginbotham’s home worked perfectly every time. One of the voice-command devices she uses is the Amazon Echo. Cloud-connected, it’s designed to turn on music, look up email and various other tasks through a “personality” called Alexa. When asked about “Nightline,” Alexa instantly provided a correct response, but when asked what the stock market is doing, she drew a blank.

“If you live in a smart home, you have got to be prepared to live in a home that is a bit of trial and error process,” Higginbotham said. “I spend probably an hour a week just troubleshooting my house, and that’s because I have a good 40 gadgets in here.”

But there’s another concern. At a time when it seems anyone, from A-list celebrities to international government databases, can be hacked, is upgrading to smart homes opening consumers up to security risks?

“People say that people can control your house, but the likelihood of someone coming in and being like, ‘I’m going to attack your network,’ that’s a lot of effort,” Higginbotham said.

To test it, Higginbotham gave “Nightline” permission to allow professional hacker Amir Etemadieh to try to hack into her home. Etemadieh, whose real job is to help companies find weaknesses in their wireless products, got to work from his car parked outside Higginbotham’s home.

Etemadieh explained that hacking into her home was a two-step process. First step was to get into her Wi-Fi network, something he called “the handshake.” The second step was to run what information Etemadieh found through a decoding program to crack her password, which proved to be more difficult."

Stogner, an anchor on ABC's North Carolina station WTVD for 40 years, announced that he will be retiring and has been diagnosed with ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease.

""For nearly four decades, I've met you right here, usually at 6,"" Stogner began, addressing viewers. ""Boy, we've seen a lot of change over those years. But, we have to stop meeting this way.""

Before announcing the diagnosis, he drew attention to his voice.

""I am sure that in recent months, you've noticed a change in my voice, my speech [is] slower,"" he said. ""Many of you were kind enough to email me ideas about what it might be, or just to show concern, and I truly appreciate that.""

""As it turns out, I have ALS, Lou Gehrig's Disease,"" he added.

ALS, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, is a an incurable neurological disease that eventually causes the brain to stop communicating with the muscles. Those who have it eventually lose their ability to move and speak, and the condition is fatal. Some, like Stephen Hawking, are able to survive, in part, thanks to breathing mechanisms.

The ALS ice bucket challenge took the nation by storm as people challenged each other to either douse themselves with a bucket of ice water and share it on social media or donate to ALS research.  Even the cast of ""Good Morning America"" got involved.

Stogner took the challenge, too, and said ""little did I know it was about to change my life.""

He said his career was over, and he was ""blessed"" to have had such a great job at WTVD. He will take a vacation and return to the air in two weeks to say goodbye to his viewers, he added."
1EpIxUg,2015-02-19 00:00:00,"President Obama Says ISIS 'Not Religious Leaders, They are Terrorists' - ABC News",http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/president-obama-isis-religious-leaders-terrorists/story?id=29061288,"President Obama rejected the notion today that groups like ISIS are operating from a religious foundation -- but labeled them simply as terrorists, adding that the United States is at war with those who have “perverted Islam.”

“Al Qaeda and ISIL and groups like it are desperate for legitimacy. They try to portray themselves as religious leaders, holy warriors in defense of Islam,” Obama said at the White House. “We must never accept the premise that they put forth because it is a lie. Nor should we grant these terrorists the religious legitimacy that they seek. They are not religious leaders. They are terrorists.”

“We are not at war with Islam. We are at war with people who have perverted Islam,” the president added.

Obama’s comments came on the second day of the first ever White House summit on Countering Violent Extremism. The White House has faced some criticism over its decision to not directly tie terrorism to Islamic or Muslim extremism.

Speaking before a group of law enforcement officials and community and religious leaders, the president said terrorist groups like al Qaeda and ISIS espouse “twisted ideologies” and stressed the need to “discredit these ideologies.”

The president noted that military action will not be the only answer to combat extremists like ISIS, but that it will take a concerted effort from communities to help prevent radicalization.

“There is no one profile of a violent extremist or terrorist. There’s no way to predict who will become radicalized,” the president said.

The president also emphasized the need to promote the spirit of diversity and inclusion in the United States and asked communities to work with Muslim Americans to help counter extremist ideologies.

“If we're gonna solve these issues, then the people who are most targeted and potentially most affected, Muslim Americans, have to have a seat at the table where they can help shape and strengthen these partnerships,” he said. “We're all working together to help communities stay safe and strong and resilient.”

President Obama highlighted the outreach efforts of ISIS and al Qaeda, noting that they have heightened their social media campaign to radicalize young people.

“The high-quality videos, the online magazines, the use of social media, terrorists Twitter accounts -- it's all designed to target today's young people online in cyberspace,” he said. “By the way, the older people here, as wise and respected as you may be, your stuff is often boring compared to what they're doing.”

“You're not connected. And as a consequence, you are not connecting,” he said.

The summit continues on Thursday when leaders from 60 countries gather at the State Department to discuss ways to combat violent extremism."

But a statue hundreds of years old, recently analyzed in Europe, is a rarity: A full mummy of a meditating monk resides inside of it.

Researchers at the Netherlands' Meander Medical Center found the preserved body of a Buddhist master who likely died around the year 1100, believed to be named Liuquan, in a statue that had been exhibited last year at the Drents Museum in Netherlands.

Scientists had known the statue contained a mummy, but even so, the CT scans of the statue reveal unprecedented information about an extreme form of meditation.

Its display at the Drents Museum marked the first time the statue had been outside of China, reported Discover Magazine, and following the close of the exhibit the statue was taken to the Meander Medical Center in Amersfoort, Netherlands for CT scans.

The practice might sound like a grim effort to take one's life, but that wasn't its intent: Self-mummification was only for the most devoted of religious monks, and the practice was seen as a path to enlightenment or an advanced spiritual state.

The imaging confirmed the existence of Liquan's mummy. The monk, believed to be a member of the Chinese Meditation School, may have practiced self-mummification, considered by certain Buddhists to be the highest form of religious enlightenment.


The process involved first a rigorous, year-long diet of water nuts, berries and other similar foods, abstaining completely from grains and more substantial food, reports  c|net. Afterward, the monk would likely be fed a tea made from a toxic lacquer tree, given a tube used for food and air, and a bell to indicate that the monk was still alive.


When the bell stopped ringing, the monk would be sealed in a tomb for three more years, and when reopened, a deceased monk found intact would be said to have reached true enlightenment; those who decomposed would have been considered to fall short of their goal, though their attempts were still honored. Some successful ""living Buddhas"" would have shrines built in their honor, according to a study of the practice by iO9.

This particular monk's organs have been removed and replaced with scrolls of paper inscribed with ancient Chinese characters; the Drents Museum considers it an example of self-mummification, and more research is needed into the existence of the scrolls and their meaning.

The statue will be on display at the Hungarian Natural History Museum until May 2015."

The manatees were freed early Tuesday, Satellite Beach Fire Department Captain Jay Dragon told ABC News.

Crews from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission, the Satellite Beach Fire Department and Police Department and city utilities worked to access into the culverts where the marine mammals were trapped, so a five-member team from SeaWorld could lift them out and release them back into the water, officials said.

#BREAKING up close look at #manatee that was just freed from drain. #WFTV pic.twitter.com/mDBFsrksko

With rain in the forecast, there was concern that the animals stuck in the drain could drown if the culvert were to fill with water.

Manatees, which are very curious, occasionally swim into storm drains, but because the culvert gradually narrows, some larger animals can get wedged and stuck, according to Ann Spellman, a marine biologist with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission.

Even if only one gets physically wedged in the pipe, any others following it can't get out, because they cannot swim backwards and don't have room to turn around.

After the mass stranding was discovered Monday, the city installed grates on the mouth of the culverts in the area to prevent any other manatees from swimming in."

But since September, Republicans and Democrats haven’t been able to agree on a full year of funding –- instead, twice since then they’ve agreed to fund DHS for a couple of months, each time hoping to reach a deal on a full year of funding. Time runs out again Friday night, but no deal is in sight.

Republicans irked by President Obama’s plan to give legal status to 5 million illegal immigrants say this time they’ll let DHS “shut down” unless the Obama administration backs down from its immigration plan. Democrats insist DHS funding shouldn’t be tied to a presidential action taken without Congressional approval.

But if DHS does “shut down,” should you be worried? It depends who you are, and how long the shutdown lasts.

If you’re one of the 40,000 DHS employees who will be furloughed, you won’t get paid for your time off -- even if you're struggling to pay your mortgage or put food on the table. And if you’re one of the tens of thousands of front-line personnel who still has to show up at work each day, you won’t get paid either -- even those of you putting your lives on the line. It’s unclear whether any future deal in Congress will reimburse you for the paychecks you’ll miss.

If you’re one of the millions of others in America whom DHS is supposed to protect, there won’t be much of an impact from a shutdown lasting only a matter of days.

If a shutdown lasts weeks or months, however, here’s how that DHS mission will be affected, according to DHS officials:"

The state police estimated the backup to be 20 miles long.

Because of a steep hill that police say is almost impossible to climb in the heavy snowstorm, the biggest backup is in the southbound lane of I-65, four miles north of Elizabethtown, Kentucky. Another backup on northbound I-65, south of Elizabethtown, has been as long as 10 miles long, according to police.

Kentucky State Police said Interstate 65 and Highway 71 were virtually shut down. The National Guard and Red Cross were called in to rescue motorists in Hardin County, ABC affiliate station WHAS-TV in Louisville reported.

Stuck 7 hrs on #I65 I hear of new settlement being formed

Stranded drivers and passengers lamented about their predicament on social media. Some drivers left their cars to try to help shovel snow from around cars. They used hashtags like: #needrescue.

State police are offering driving tips to motorists, saying slippery roads were the contributing factor in 26,427 crashes last year. Meanwhile, the governor declared a state of emergency, the second declaration in less than a month, which allows Kentucky to deploy National Guard troops, if necessary.

I have declared a new state wide emergency, which allows communities immediate access to state resources #KYsnow

Without food or access to bathrooms, passengers pleaded for help:

Someone bring us has and a place to go pee! Lol
.....no but seriously we are pushing 9 hours in this… https://t.co/TYLRLPh23W

They were thankful for the sustenance they could forage:

Travelers then tweeted about surviving the ordeal:

Just so everyone knows, I'm peeing in a real toilet. 13 hours later but we survived! ??"
1Er9BlF,2015-02-14 00:00:00,Boston Braces For More Snow as Strong Winds Take Aim on the Northeast - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/US/boston-braces-snow-strong-winds-aim-northeast/story?id=28966302,"Boston was bracing for its fourth straight weekend of snow as another major winter storm geared up to batter the New England coast yet again.

The developing storm is part of another bitter blast of arctic air that began plunging southward on Saturday morning across the northern Plains. Wind chills as low as 43 degrees below zero were reported in parts northern Minnesota, with blinding snow squalls developing along the leading edge of the arctic air.

More than a half foot of snow was reported in parts of western Michigan, and white-out conditions played a role in numerous accidents across the Midwest on Saturday afternoon.

The worst of the cold, snow, and the developing winter storm continued to push east today, heading toward the Northeast.

Areas of snow will continue from the mid-Atlantic to the Northeast through Saturday night as the storm continues to rapidly intensify. The accumulating snow will occur for much of the Northeast into Saturday night with any remaining snow falling on New England by Sunday morning.

However, it's not just accumulating snow that is a concern from this storm. Strong winds are expected throughout the Northeast as the winter storm becomes a powerful nor'easter off the New England coast by Sunday morning.

High wind warnings are in effect for much of the Northeast, with wind gusts up to 60 mph possible Sunday in Washington D.C., Philadelphia, and New York City. The highest gusts are forecast for eastern Long Island and coastal New England, closer to where the center of the winter storm will track.

The ABC News Weather team has been emphasizing that the impending storm will be remembered more for its wind than numerous big snow totals across the Northeast region. Residents should prepare for possible power outages as the winds continue to increase Saturday night.

Coastal New England is forecast to see the brunt of the heavy snowfall as well, with one to two feet of snow forecast for the extreme northeastern coast of Massachusetts to Maine.

The city of Boston will be on the fringe of the higher snow totals, likely seeing double digit totals once again. However, the greatest amounts will be focused further north along parts of the Maine coast.

Blizzard conditions in Boston are expected once again with extremely low visibility, strong winds, hazardous travel conditions developing on Sunday morning.

The storm will begin to clear out Sunday night, but the bitter cold temperatures will remain through Monday. By early Monday morning, major cities in the Northeast will feel like they are in the -10s and -20s and freezing temperatures will settle in all the way down to northern Florida.

Some of the major cities in the Northeast may see their lowest temperatures in more than a decade, with the frigid cold possibly breaking some records by Monday morning. The current forecast low for New York City is 1 degree above zero on early Monday morning. If this occurs, it would be the coldest temperature observed in the city in years."

At the funeral for Margarita Suárez in Cuernavaca Morelos, Mexico, there was a pack of stray dogs who came inside the funeral home to stand guard.

Suárez's daughter Patricia Urrutia told ABC News that they were shocked, but delighted by the appearance of the canine celebrants.

Adding to the other-worldliness of the situation was the fact that these stray dogs were not even the same ones that her 71-year-old mother had helped during her lifetime. Suárez lived in Merida Yucatan, but her funeral service was in a town more than 830 miles away, her daughter said.

""They stayed with my mother all day, and then at night they all stayed- but In the morning all the dogs vanished but one, but one hour before we brought my mom to be cremated the dogs came back and grouped around as if to say goodbye,"" Urrutia told ABC News. ""I swear by God that it was beautiful, marvelous.""

She said that the dogs do not normally hang around the funeral home, and that workers there had never seen anything like it before.

""My mom has always been good with all animals and people,"" Urrutia said. ""Always fed the dogs on her block and the 20 stray cats that lived there.""

Urrutia posted photos of the scene on her Facebook profile on March 15 and the moving images have been shared across the Internet. As of this morning, the post has been shared more than 50,000 times on Facebook and has received more than 192,100 likes.

Urrutia said that the dogs' presence helped her through the difficult day, and it was an unexpected message that she will always remember.

""When I was in a moment of so much pain these dogs that came, they showed me that everything was going to be okay,"" Urrutia told ABC.

The dogs were not the only animal friends to pay their respects to Suárez, as Urrutia also spotted a bird come through the window at 3:00 a.m., glance down at her mother's coffin, and then fly off while singing.

""Because of them we were happy,"" Urrutia added. ""They made a sad situation an incredible one."""

“I could not look into his eyes because he wouldn't look at me,” she told ABC News today after testifying Wednesday. “But I tried and I looked him in the face several times and I wanted him to know I was not scared of him.”

She said when she looks at Tsarnaev now, she sees a “coward.” Tsarnaev couldn’t look at her, Gregory said, because she believes he’s unable to “face what he’s really done.”

Gregory lost her left leg in the April 2013 attack that killed three people –- including an eight-year-old boy –- and injured 260 others. Gregory was one of 16 to lose limbs.

Her son, Noah, was sitting at her feet when the bomb went off, but after the explosions, when she tried to help him, she realized she couldn’t get to him.

“I was like, ‘This is it. I’m gone. I can’t even help Noah as a mother. I am completely helpless at this point,'” she said, adding she thought she was going to die that day.

Noah survived with minor injuries.

Gregory said before arriving at court she experienced a flood of emotions, and she reflected back on how fearful she used to be.

“I had been for a very long time. And I didn’t realize I was so fearful, but I truly was and until yesterday, I had this sense of insecurity because of how much I had lost at the finish line that day and I took so much of that back,” she said.

Tsarnaev’s defense said in opening statements they’re not going to contest the fact that their client, along with his late older brother Tamerlan, was responsible for detonating the two bombs that day.

Legal experts told ABC News the defense is likely focusing only on trying to avoid the death penalty for Tsarnaev in the penalty phase of the case."

John McCain earned some applause inside a Senate Armed Services hearing this morning after he erupted at protesters of former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, calling them “low-life scum.”

Protesters from the group CodePink swarmed behind Kissinger as he arrived alongside two other former Secretaries of State, Madeleine Albright and George Shultz, for a hearing on U.S. national security strategy.

They held up signs calling Kissinger a criminal and chanted “arrest Henry Kissinger for war crimes” -- citing some of his more controversial decisions during the Nixon and Ford administrations.

“You know, you're going to have to shut up, or I'm going to have you arrested,” McCain said as Capitol Hill Police tried to remove the protesters. “Get out of here you low-life scum.”

Kissinger, 91, didn’t acknowledge the protesters, who again interrupted him later in the hearing prior to his opening statement.

“Dr. Kissinger, I hope on behalf of all of the members of this committee on both sides of the aisle -- in fact, from all of my colleagues, I'd like to apologize for allowing such disgraceful behavior towards a man who served his country with the greatest distinction,” McCain said. “I apologize profusely.”

In a statement today following the hearing, McCain further condemned the CodePink protest, saying members of the group ""physically threatened"" Kissinger to the point that ""some senators were concerned enough... that they came down off the dais to support the witnesses.""

""With no U.S. Capitol Police intervening, the episode went on for several minutes,"" McCain said in his statement. ""I have spoken to the Chairman of the Senate Rules Committee and the U.S. Capitol Police, and expect that those responsible will be held fully accountable for their actions.”

In a statement emailed to ABC News, U.S. Capitol Police public information officer Lieutenant Kimberly Schneider said the USCP is conducting a ""thorough review"" of the incident.

""We take very seriously our mission to protect the Congress and its legislative processes, while balancing safety and security, and the First Amendment rights of people to peaceably assemble,"" the statement reads. ""Today, our actions in [the hearing] clearly did not demonstrate that mission, nor did our actions meet the standards expected of the USCP."""
1ERQrpE,2015-02-26 00:00:00,'American Sniper' Trial: Eddie Routh Attorney Says Jurors Who Saw Movie Didn't Hurt Case - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/US/american-sniper-trial-eddie-routh-attorney-jurors-movie/story?id=29231842,"A defense attorney for Eddie Ray Routh, who was convicted of capital murder in the “American Sniper” trial, said the fact that some jurors had seen the movie did not hurt their case.

The movie “American Sniper,” which was up for six Oscars this past weekend, including Best Picture, is based on the memoir of famed Navy SEAL Chris Kyle, the most lethal sniper in U.S. military history.

A Texas jury of 10 women and two men found Routh guilty Tuesday of killing Kyle and Kyle’s friend Chad Littlefield during a trip to a gun range Feb. 2, 2013. After the verdict, it was revealed that several members of the jury saw the movie before being selected to serve on the trial, but they maintained it did not interfere with their ability to fairly judge Routh.

Attorney Shay Isham, who was part of the team that defended Routh, said in an interview with ABC News’ ""Nightline"" that there were concerns about selecting jurors for the highly publicized case, but they didn't see the movie as a reason to dismiss them.

“I’ve been picking juries here for 19 years and in a whole lot of other counties, too. Just because someone has seen the movie doesn't automatically disqualify them,” Isham said. “Most of the people that can do that job and can take an oath to not be leaning one way or the other, and wait until the evidence is finished to make up their mind and deliberate the case; most of them that tell me that, they can set that aside.”

“There wasn't very many jurors dismissed because of too much pretrial publicity because they've seen so much or read so much that they already had their mind made up,” he added. ""You get 10 strikes in a criminal case in the state of Texas and so there’s a whole bunch of things that go into whether you want to exercise one of those precious few strikes that you have.""

Routh had pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity and his attorneys had argued the former Marine had mental disorders and was in the grips of psychosis when he fatally shot Kyle and Littlefield.

Because Routh’s lawyers never disputed he killed the two men, the biggest question the jurors had to answer was whether they thought he was legally insane or whether he was faking his claims of insanity.

Seven members of the 12-person jury spoke to ABC News today about how they came to the unanimous decision after two and a half hours Tuesday night.

""That was something that we really had to figure out,"" juror Kristina Yager told ABC News. ""In the beginning, I know a lot of us came into the jury questioning that, but evidence shows that there was a real definite pattern there.""

""When I say there’s a pattern that we saw, he would get intoxicated, get in trouble, and then the police would show up and he would say ‘I'm a veteran, I have PTSD, I'm insane,’ you know, and every time something bad happened he pulled that card,"" Yager said.

Routh’s mental state was at the crux of the case, with both sides presenting experts who disputed different diagnoses up until the final hours of the trial."

Kyesha Smith Wood, of Birmingham, Alabama, dropped off her son, daughter and step-daughter at the movies, she said in a Facebook post early Saturday morning. The son is a teenager and the two girls are 13, according to ABC's Birmingham affiliate, ABC 33/40.

""My son later told me, much to my humiliation and embarrassment, that my girls were rude and obnoxious during the movie. The woman I'm looking for addressed them and asked them to be quiet and they were disrespectful,"" Wood wrote on Facebook. ""After the movie she approached my girls and told them that her husband had been laid off and this was the last movie she would be able to take her daughter to for a while and my girls ruined that for her.""

Wood's post asked for the woman to contact her.

""This rude, disrespectful, and awful behavior is unacceptable and they owe you an apology,"" Wood wrote.

This is a long shot, but I'm looking for a woman that was at Tannehill Premier tonight seeing Cinderella at 7pm. I...

When sheriff's office Sgt. Jack Self saw Wood's post, he shared it on the Jefferson County Sheriff Facebook page. The post generated more than 245,000 likes after the sheriff's department asked, ""What do you think of the way this local mom is handling this situation?,"" and added, ""Looks like these children have great parents.""

""I live in that community,"" Self told ABC News today. ""I just felt like if I could put it for a bigger audience, maybe she could find the lady she was looking for.""

The Birmingham mom's message spread and the apparent mystery woman -- Rebecca Boyd of Adger, Alabama -- left a comment on the sheriff's office post.

""I am the mom from the movie theatre,"" Boyd wrote in the comment. ""I had taken my daughter to see Cinderella..I was very upset and disappointed in the girls behavior...the note from their mom brought me to tears and shows there is still good people in the world. I have no hard feelings towards them and I am proud of their parents. The girls are not not bad...they are children. Glad they are learning a lesson. I hope if my teenagers are out and they act up...I hope someone says something to them.""

Boyd then contacted Wood, according to ABC 33/40.

""She's the most gracious, kind and forgiving woman,"" Wood told ABC 33/40. ""I am so humbled by that.""

Wood's daughters will write an apology letter to Boyd, according to Wood's Facebook post, and also contribute some of their allowance towards the Boyd family's next trip to the movies.

""My girls are so mortified,"" Wood told ABC 33/40. ""They are humiliated. And that's OK because I told them, 'You know what, you're not going to do this again.""

ABC 33/40 said the publicity over the story has resulted in support and job offers for Boyd's family.

Boyd told ABC News today she'd like to see the girls again.

""I believe they’re good girls,"" Boyd said. ""They just made some mistakes.”"

A replica of a U.S. aircraft carrier was damaged by speedboats during the drills, which were televised in Iran.

Cmdr. Kevin Stephens, the spokesman for the U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet in Bahrain, told the Associated Press that they were monitoring the drills, but downplayed the simulated attack on the carrier, saying the U.S. military was ""not concerned about this exercise.""

The drills come ahead of a deadline for Iran and world powers to finalize a deal regarding Iran’s nuclear program, which has long been a point of contention."
1Erybac,2015-03-30 00:00:00,"Yawning, Whistling Might Get You Flagged at Airport Security - ABC News",http://abcnews.go.com/Travel/yawning-whistling-flagged-airport-security/story?id=30010685,"Excessive yawning, whistling and too much laughter could possibly find you detained by airport security agents for further questioning, according to a recently released list.

The SPOT Referral Report, which stands for ""Screening of Passengers by Observation Techniques,"" was obtained a week ago by The Intercept, which claims the unclassified report is a ""closely held"" Transportation Security Administration (TSA) document detailing what Behavior Detection Officers look for when observing suspicious travelers and possible terrorists at the nation's airports.

Actions appearing on the 92-point checklist featured on The Intercept were divided into categories such as ""stress factors,"" ""fear factors"" and ""signs of deception,"" and ranged from ""appears to be in disguise"" and ""face pale from recent shaving of beard"" to ""excessive yawning,"" ""excessive throat clearing"" and ""gazing down.""

TSA would neither confirm or deny to ABC News whether the specific indicators listed in the leaked report are used by officials or other parts of the administration. But a spokesperson did acknowledge that it does use behavior detection and analysis.

""Behavior detection, which is just one element of the TSA's efforts to mitigate threats against the traveling public, is vital to TSA’s layered approach to deter, detect and disrupt individuals who pose a threat to aviation,"" said a TSA spokesperson.

Detractors of the SPOT practice contend that many of the behaviors listed on the report are no different from how regular travelers appear when passing through airport security.

Meanwhile, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) recently sued the TSA for not releasing SPOT documents, saying the program encourages racial profiling.

“What we know about SPOT suggests it wastes taxpayer money, leads to racial profiling, and should be scrapped,” said Hugh Handeyside, staff attorney with the ACLU National Security Project in a statement announcing the lawsuit. “The TSA has insisted on keeping documents about SPOT secret, but the agency can’t hide the fact that there’s no evidence the program works. The discriminatory racial profiling that SPOT has apparently led to only reinforces that the public needs to know more about how this program is used and with what consequences for Americans’ rights.”

But the TSA defended its program in a statement to ABC News.

“Terrorists have used a variety of items and ways to attempt to inflict harm to aircraft -- everything from shoes to liquids — but consistent across all methods of attack is the malicious intent of the actor,"" said a TSA spokesperson. ""Looking for suspicious behavior is a common sense approach used by law enforcement and security personnel across the country and the world, that focuses on those behavioral indicators, rather than items, and when used in combination with other security layers helps mitigate a variety of threats.""

But normal individuals with ""strong body odor,"" ""trembling hands,"" ""protruding neck arteries"" or exhibiting other factors noted on the report shouldn't have cause for immediate worry, cautioned the administration.

""No single behavior alone will cause a traveler to be referred to additional screening or will result in a call to a law enforcement officer,"" the TSA spokesperson said, adding, ""Officers are trained and audited to ensure referrals for additional screening are based only on observable behaviors and not race or ethnicity.”"

Speaking to lawmakers, Verity Harding, the public policy manager for Google, which owns the video website, said approximately 300 hours of video are uploaded every minute by users around the world. That's 12 and a half days of content every minute.

""To pre-screen those videos before they are uploaded would be like screening a phone call before it's made,"" she said at the meeting, according to the Associated Press.

The meeting comes as the European Union's counter-terrorism chief has called for help from member states to flag terror-related content as soon as it appears.

The first line of defense for YouTube has been relying on users to flag content they deem inappropriate.

""With so much content on the site, it would be impossible to review it all,"" reads a page explaining YouTube's policy. ""That's why we rely on YouTube community members to flag content that they find inappropriate.""

While it is not clear how many videos are flagged per day, YouTube said it staffs a team at all hours to review flagged content.

Instead, the drone’s owner told ABC News that both of them are now convinced the company that manufactured the drone deserves much of the blame.

The owner said drones sold by China-based DJI have a “well-documented” problem with so-called “flyaway” – when an operator loses control of a drone already in the air.

“It just goes rogue,” said the owner, speaking to ABC News on the condition of anonymity. “It goes where it wants.”

Indeed, countless messages posted on DJI’s own online forum and several videos posted on YouTube report instances of “flyaway.” One post calls it “an amazing product flaw.”

But at least one message on the DJI forum cites “pilot error” and “environmental interference” from microwave and cell towers as some “primary causes.”

Nevertheless, the owner of the drone that landed just yards from the West Wing early Monday morning said a “fundamental flaw” with his drone played a “decisive part in the whole fiasco.”

“It’s not his fault,” said the drone’s owner, referring to his friend, a “hard-working civil servant” who is now facing potential criminal charges in the matter.

“This never would have happened at all without that DJI flaw,” said the drone’s owner, adding that if a vehicle had a similar flaw, authorities would have issued a nationwide recall.

The owner said he bought his drone in November from Amazon.com for $499. Over the next couple of months, he and his friend repeatedly flew the drone with no problems, often sending it airborne above a high school in suburban Virginia.

About two weeks ago, his friend borrowed the drone. Alone early Monday morning--having returned hours earlier from a date--the friend launched the drone above an adjacent building, the drone’s owner said he was told by his friend.

Then, all of a sudden, the drone “shot up so high he couldn’t see it anymore,” with a last glimpse showing it heading east toward the National Mall, according to the drone owner.

In a pre-dawn phone call, the pair guessed it would crash on a rooftop and decided to look for it in the morning, the owner said.

But instead, it crashed inside the White House complex, prompting what the Secret Service called “an immediate alert and lockdown of the complex,” and then a federal investigation.

When the drone owner’s friend realized what was happening, he called his supervisor at the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, and they notified the Secret Service, which then questioned the federal employee and the drone’s owner.

Now prosecutors in Washington are mulling over whether to file charges against the man who flew the drone early Monday.

Local law prohibits drone flights inside Washington, D.C., and federal regulations prohibit such flights near the White House. In addition, federal law makes it a crime to deliberately interfere with air traffic, but law enforcement officials concluded early on that the drone operator had no malicious intent.

By all accounts, those who have spent time with the man behind the White House scare describe him as a “great guy” who is “clearly very intelligent and passionate about his work.”

An online search shows him to have a long-established interest in aviation.

“I hope that this incident doesn't ruin his impressive career with the U.S. government,” said an acquaintance who has hung out with him many times at social events.

Emails and calls seeking comment from the Secret Service and the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Washington, D.C., were not returned.

A DJI spokesman said his company's drones include ""a robust series of safety mechanisms to ensure that pilots fly successfully,"" but those functions ""need to be set up by the operator and monitored for environmental interference.""

Based on media accounts, the DJI spokesman said the White House-related incident sounds like one in which ""the pilot failed to accurately calibrate the system before take off.""

Last year, when asked about the matter at a public forum, DJI officers said newer drones have further safeguards and that ""flyaways"" can often be ascribed to users not closely following instructions.

Carol Armstrong contacted the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum, whose curator learned that these were personal items intended to be left on the moon.

""She called and said she found this white cloth bag in Neil's closet,"" Allan Needell, curator of the Apollo collection at the Smithsonian, told ABC News today. ""She said it looked like there were things from a spacecraft in there and would we be interested.""

Carol Armstrong sent a photo to the museum, and Needell said ""once we found out what they were, we went to work documenting.""

The ""temporary storage bag"" Carol Armstrong found had about 17 Apollo-related items inside, including utility lights with power cables, a waist tether and netting, according to the Smithsonian, which unveiled its research into the items on Friday.

One of the most important items was a 16mm movie data acquisition camera, which was used to film the moon landing, ""as well as Neil Armstrong's and Buzz Aldrin's activities on the lunar surface, including taking the first samples of lunar soil and planting the U.S. flag,"" the Smithsonian reports.

""These items were cataloged items and basically scheduled to be left in the lunar module,"" Needell told ABC News. ""We have some evidence ... these were just surplus items they were taking home.""

""There was only so much room on the spacecraft on the way back,"" Needell said, and priority went to scientific samples such as moon dust and rocks. ""A lot of stuff gets left behind on the moon. It wasn't as though they could pack up everything they brought.""

""What many of the astronauts did once things were surplus and basically not required for science or other missions ... certain items that astronauts have managed to keep as sort of personal momenta. Control handles, or something like that,"" Needell said.

""I think probably it was unspoken tradition to do some of that,"" Needell added. ""This is not uncommon. Many other astronauts had personal collections of souvenirs.""

The items found in Armstrong's closet ""had no more mission significance,"" Needell said. ""They were no longer needed. The camera, for instance, is a cartridge camera. All the cartridges with film were taken back, but once they were finished filming, they had no need for the camera anymore.""

It was intended for the camera to have ""have been left in the spacecraft and destroyed"" but ""Neil decided to take it home.""

It was ""the camera that took pictures of the landing,"" Needell said, noting it was an ""emotionally significant item.""

Needell said he doesn't think Armstrong was purposely hiding the memorabilia. ""He was a very private person,"" he noted. ""This was characteristic of him.""

Needell's own guess is that the items are a ""personal souvenir of an extraordinary episode in his own life.""

Several of the items, including the camera and waist tether, are already on display in a new gallery about 50 years of spacewalking, Needell said. The others are still being cataloged."

The country is home to a fox village, bunny island and cat island where you can find yourself delightfully swarmed by hundreds of these free-roaming, furry animals.

Here's a look into the paradises for animal lovers:

Okunoshima: Bunny Island

Hundreds of friendly feral bunnies hop ""all over"" this small island and approach tourists to their delight,"" said Elliss Krauss, a professor of Japanese politics and policy-making at University of California San Diego.

""They are very friendly and hope to be fed,"" Krauss told ABC News today. But he added that despite the bunnies' cuteness, the island has a dark history with them.

This small island was kept secret and off the maps during World War II when Japan produced poison gas on Okunoshima for chemical warfare against China. Where today's bunnies came from remains a mystery. Scientists debate whether they're descendants of test bunnies that were used at the poison gas factories, The Guardian reported.

Miyagi Zao Fox Village

For less than 1000 yen ($9), you can find the answer to the elusive question, ""What does the fox say?"" at this sanctuary where 100 foxes scamper freely, according to the village's website.

The attraction is in a forest in the scenic Miyagi Zao mountains, which makes you feel like you're in the wilderness, according to Japan Travel The site adds you can get up close with the foxes of various colors and even feed them for less than 100 yen ($1). But it's important to be cautious since they can bite, though most of them are tame, the website notes.

Tashirojima: Cat Island

Cat lovers can rejoice on this quiet fishing island where there are four cats to every person, according to Japan Guide.

The kitties were originally brought to the island to help with pest control on the island's silkworm farms. Many of Tashirojima's locals, most of whom are above 65 years old, believe feeding the hundreds of stray cats bring good luck and fortune.

But for dog lovers, this island may be sad news. No dogs allowed here, according to Atlas Obscura."

Their tool? Thank-you cards to police officers.

""We were very angry and frustrated after the non-indictment of Darren Wilson for killing Michael Brown in Ferguson,"" Truth Urban Theater Group's co-founder Shadrack Boakye told ABC News today. ""But rather than constantly arguing about it, we decided we needed to do something.""

The group, which performs on issues that affect urban youth, Boakye said, was inspired by the Martin Luther King, Jr. quote, ""Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that.""

That's when they came up with the idea of #CardsForCops after brainstorming positive ways to get a dialogue started between cops and civilians, Boakye said.

""We had kids in our community make thank-you cards, and we went out to the streets of New York City the Sunday after the Million March,"" Boakye said. ""We thought it'd be the best time to go because they'd probably really on guard from the protests.""

A big thanks to @thetruthutg for visiting our cops today on #UpperEastSide #UES #PoliceandCommunity #CardsforCops http://t.co/hDIjxvRkmt

Boakye added that the members of the group talked about their fear of going up to cops doing this and the ""very real possibility someone could be misunderstood and get hurt or shot"" while doing the project.

""We were fearful for our lives,"" Boakye said. ""The first cop we went up to seemed very apprehensive, and we could feel tension, but then when they realized what we were doing, there was a complete transformation.

""The cop said what we were doing was amazing and couldn't believe it,"" Boakye said. ""We could feel the love at that moment.""

The Urban Truth Theater Group has gone out to hand out thank you cards several more times since then, Boakye said, adding he's even bringing along children from their community sometimes.

“These children were also scared at first,"" Boakye said, “but once they saw the positive reaction from the officers, their eyes lit up, they smiled and there was a connection.

After a YouTube video of the #CardsForCops project went up, Boakye said they got a lot of positive response from the community and got in touch with city officials.

""We’re going to hold a public dialogue in Brooklyn [on] May 2,” Boakye said. “The focus will be on the idea of a trigger -- what triggers the officers and what triggers a civilian to help us better understand each other.”

@TheTruthUTG my cop bro was shot at this morning, 15 bullets to his car. I was feeling horrid. Then I saw you guys. I'm overwhelmed. ????

The Urban Truth Theater Group also plans to drive down to Ferguson and expand their project there.

“The fact is that there are officers out there that do not know how to do their jobs well or know how to communicate with civilians and vice versa,” Boakye said. “What we want is to facilitate better communication with each other to rebuild trust and unity within our communities.”"

Attaching something so small to a buzzing bee takes both patience and precision.

In order to suit up the bees, they were first chilled for ten minutes to make them calmer. Using tweezers, researchers then carefully glued the trackers onto the bees' backs using superglue.

The bee backpacks measure 4.8 millimeters by 8 millimeters. They include radio frequency identification tags that allow ecologists to detect bee behavior from as far as 1.2 meters from a detecting unit.

Each bee has a unique tag that allows researchers to monitor their behavior. The tag reports back to the detecting unit within its range.

""This piece of the puzzle, of bee behavior, is absolutely vital if we are to understand better why our bees are struggling and how we can reverse their decline,"" Sarah Barlow, a scientist at Kew Gardens who tested the technology, said in a statement.

The technology, which was developed by Tumbling Dice Ltd., could be used after the trial to track the movements of other insects and how they interact with flora, fauna, crops and the world around us, scientists said."

Khurana operated on instinct, he says, running to the scene to ensure the pilot was safe.

“He was stunned a bit,” Khurana said. “He was moaning and in pain.”

Khurana says he quickly recognized the famous pilot.

“It was obvious by his face, it was Harrison Ford. I’m old enough, or young enough, to have watched all his ‘Star Wars’ films. So, it was obvious,” Khurana told ABC News.

A group of golfers help extract Ford from the plane and worked to stabilize his spine and neck. Khurana tried to check the man’s blood pressure and his airway, ensuring that he would be OK.

Ford, 72, was later hospitalized in “fair to moderate” condition, said Patrick Butler of the Los Angeles Fire Department. His publicist, Ina Treciokas, described the actor’s injuries as non-life-threatening.

The actor reported engine trouble shortly after taking off from Santa Monica Municipal Airport and asked for an immediate return to the airport, National Transportation Safety Board investigator Patrick Jones said. The tower then reported that his aircraft came up short of the runway, according to air traffic controller transmissions from LiveATC.net.

The vintage airplane that Ford was piloting clipped a tree before crashing, Jones said.

Hours after the crash, Khurana remained surprised by what occurred.

“You don't go golfing expecting to see an airplane crash and to help extract someone and realize it's someone you know from the movies, right? It's fairly bizarre,” he said.

“But as a surgeon, I've been practicing for almost over a decade now, you deal with urgent situations. So you have to do your best for someone in distress.”"

The mother has been identified as Yvonne Selke, who worked at the consulting company Booz Allen Hamilton, and the company has confirmed her identity to ABC News.

The second American victim was her daughter Emily Selke, a recent graduate of Drexel University.

""Our entire family is deeply saddened by the losses of Yvonne and Emily Selke,"" the family said in a statement today. ""Two wonderful, caring, amazing people who meant so much to so many. At this difficult time we respectfully ask for privacy and your prayers.""

Both Booz Allen Hamilton and Drexel have released statements about the loss to their communities.

""Booz Allen and our employees are mourning the sudden and shocking death of Yvonne Selke, an employee of nearly 23 years, and her daughter, Emily, in the Germanwings airliner crash in the French Alps this week,"" the company's Executive Vice President Betty Thompson said in a statement.

""Yvonne was a wonderful co-worker and a dedicated employee who spent her career with the firm supporting the mission of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency,"" Thompson said.

National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Director Robert Cardillo also offered condolences.

""Every death is a tragedy, but seldom does a death affect us all so directly and unexpectedly,"" Cardillo said in a statement. ""All of us offer our deepest condolences and will keep her family and her colleagues in our thoughts.""

The Drexel University spokesperson said they were ""deeply saddened"" by the Selkes' deaths.

""Emily graduated with honors from Drexel in 2013 and was a music industry major in Drexel’s Antoinette Westphal College of Media Arts & Design,"" the statement read. ""Our thoughts and prayers are with her family and friends.""

Emily Selke was a member of the Gamma Sigma Sigma Zeta sorority, and the national organization put out a statement confirming that she joined in 2011.

The Selkes were two of the 150 people who died in the Tuesday morning crash.

There was a third American, yet to be identified, on board, according to the U.S. State Department.

“It is with profound sadness that we have learned of the death of Kayla Jean Mueller,” Obama said in a statement released by the White House. “On behalf of the American people, Michelle and I convey our deepest condolences to Kayla’s family – her parents, Marsha and Carl, and her brother Eric and his family – and all of those who loved Kayla dearly. At this time of unimaginable suffering, the country shares in their grief.”

ISIS claimed in a statement Friday Mueller had been killed, but no evidence of her death was presented, prompting doubts about ISIS’s claim from former U.S. officials.

A spokesperson for the White House National Security Council said that over the weekend, the Mueller family ""received a private message from Kayla's ISIL [ISIS] captors containing additional information.""

""Once this information was authenticated by the intelligence community, they concluded that Kayla was deceased,"" NSC spokesperson Bernadette Meehan said.

The “information” provided by ISIS included photographic evidence, a senior U.S. official told ABC News. An intelligence official told ABC News it is unclear when or how Mueller was killed and another added there was no evidence an airstrike was responsible for her death, as ISIS had claimed.

Mueller's parents, Carl and Marsha, released a statement shortly after the White House.

""We are heartbroken to share that we've received confirmation that Kayla Jean Mueller, has lost her life,"" the statement said. ""Kayla was a compassionate and devoted humanitarian. She dedicated the whole of her young life to helping those in need from freedom, justice and peace... Our hearts are breaking for our only daughter, but we will continue in peace, dignity and love for her.""

Mueller, from Prescott, Ariz., was kidnapped Aug. 4, 2013 after leaving a Spanish Doctors Without Borders hospital in Aleppo, Syria, according to information provided by a family spokesperson.

She had graduated from Northern Arizona University in 2009 and “has devoted her career to helping those in need in countries around the world,” the family spokesperson said.

Mueller told her town's local newspaper, The Daily Courier, she felt called to help those suffering the most in the midst of the Syrian conflict.

“For as long as I live, I will not let this suffering be normal,” she said in the May 2013 report. “[I will not let this be] something we just accept… It’s important to stop and realize what we have, why we have it and how privileged we are. And from that place, start caring and get a lot done.”

In October 2011, Mueller uploaded a video to a Syrian activist YouTube channel in which she said, “I am in solidarity with the Syrian people.”

“I condemn in the strongest possible manner the destruction of the archaeological site of Nimrud site in Iraq. This is yet another attack against the Iraqi people, reminding us that nothing is safe from the cultural cleansing underway in the country: It targets human lives, minorities, and is marked by the systematic destruction of humanity’s ancient heritage,” Irina Bokova, Director of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization said today. “We cannot remain silent. The deliberate destruction of cultural heritage constitutes a war crime. I call on all political and religious leaders in the region to stand up and remind everyone that there is absolutely no political or religious justification for the destruction of humanity’s cultural heritage.”

Bokova’s statement came a day after Iraqi television reported that ISIS militants had “bulldozed” Nimrud, the second capital of the Assyrian Empire founded during the 13th century B.C., which lies approximately 20 miles south of Mosul, according to the UN. The Associated Press reported that the discovery of treasures in Nimrud’s royal tombs in the 1980s was “one of the 20th century’s most significant archaeological finds.”

“[Nimrud’s] frescos and works are celebrated around the world and revered in literature and sacred texts,” Bokova said.

Beyond the human toll of countless of ISIS’s alleged war crimes – including the systematic murder of unarmed civilians and prisoners, persecution of minorities and the use of young women as sex slaves – academics and officials have said ISIS has targeted for destruction anything that doesn’t conform to their twisted interpretation of Islam, no matter the cultural value.

Last week video emerged that appeared to show ISIS militants taking sledgehammers to artifacts in a museum in Mosul, pushing over statues and drilling into other ancient treasures. Some of the statues appear to have metal rods inside them, suggesting they’re replicas, but others just crumble when they hit the floor.

“These antiquities and idols behind me were from people in past centuries and were worshiped instead of God,” an unidentified man says in the video. “When God Almighty orders us to destroy these statues, idols and antiquities, we must do it, even if they’re worth billions of dollars.”

But ISIS is hardly above stealing ancient treasures for financial gain. David Cohen, Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence at the U.S. Treasury Department, named looting as one financial supply line for ISIS and said the group “lay[s] waste to thousands of years of civilization in Iraq and Syria by looting and selling antiquities.”

In January ISIS purportedly stole around 2,000 books from the Central Library of Mosul, loading up the texts including children’s stories and poetry, and trucking them away, according to The New York Times. They left only the Islamic texts.

“These books promote infidelity and call for disobeying Allah,” a bearded militant reportedly told locals. “So they will be burned.”

Looting has been a major problem for cultural heritage since the outset of the Syrian civil war. As noted by the website TraffickingCulture.org, satellite images show the destruction at one site, the ancient Syrian city of Apamea, that took place just between 2011 and 2012. An image from the latter period shows the ground covered in pockmarks, presumably thousands of holes dug by looters.

In 2013, the International Council on Museums issued an “emergency red list” identifying categories of Syrian artifacts that are in danger of being looted so that museums, private collectors, auction houses and art dealers would know not to buy them.

“Objects from these sites are highly coveted in the international art and antiquities markets and therefore subject to theft, looting and illicit trafficking,” the notice says.

“What started as opportunistic theft by some has turned into an organized transnational business that is helping fund terror,” Michael Danti, an archaeologist at Boston University, told The Wall Street Journal last month. “It’s the gravest cultural emergency I’ve seen.”

Bokova said ISIS’s latest acts in Iraq must not be tolerated by the world.

“I call on all of those who can, especially youth, in Iraq and elsewhere, to do everything possible to protect this heritage, to claim it as their own, and as heritage of the whole of humanity,” she said. “I appeal also to all cultural institutions, museums, journalists, professors, and scientists to share and explain the importance of this heritage and the Mesopotamian civilization. We must respond to this criminal chaos that destroys culture with more culture.”"

Free Methodist ministry said that Phyllis Sortor was returned to authorities in Nigeria.

The 71-year-old, who was abducted on Feb. 23, is now in the care of church leaders, the church said.

The statement by the Free Methodist missionary did not give any details about her 12-day-long abduction or say anything about possible suspects.

The Associated Press previously reported that her captors were demanding $300,000 for her return but there have not been any updates about whether or not that was paid.

""Phyllis was aware there were risks associated with her ministry, but also knew there are very few places in the world without risks and dangers,"" the church's statement read.

Initial reports stated that Sortor, a reverend, was abducted from the compound of a school in the country's Kogi state."

Last month, Bush revealed he follows the Paleo diet -- a strict regimen of eating only what our hunter-gatherer ancestors ate: vegetables, meats, seafood, fruits and nuts.

“Continue to pray that I stick on this Paleo diet where my pants fall down,” Bush told donors in Tallahassee in February. “Perpetually starving to death apparently is the source of losing weight.”

But in a state famous for such delicacies as deep fried Oreos and funnel cake served up every year at the Iowa State Fair, Bush may have a major culinary conundrum on his hands.

On this, his first trip to the Hawkeye State since 2012, he will face a veritable buffet of temptations -- whether it’s baby back ribs drenched in barbecue sauce at Jethro’s BBQ ‘n Jambalaya in Waukee (the restaurant doesn’t offer Paleo-friendly sauces, ABC News checked) or snacking on a cheesy slice at the Cedar Rapids Pizza Ranch, an iconic Iowa-based restaurant chain that countless politicians frequent.

When asked, a spokesman for Bush could not immediately say whether the former governor will break the Paleo rules and indulge, or stick to his diet.

But Iowa is just the beginning. If Bush officially jumps into the race, he’ll have South Carolina grits and Wisconsin cheese curds to worry about too -- among other things.

Maybe the former Florida governor should seek the advice of his son, George P. Bush, on how to navigate the perpetual campaign trail buffet line. The younger Bush managed to adhere to the Paleo diet and turned to CrossFit to stay in shape during his successful campaign for Texas Land Commissioner.

As he determines how closely he will follow the Paleo diet on the trail, Bush still understands the importance of paying homage to Iowa's food-centric events. At an event in Urbandale Friday night, the potential Republican hopeful threw in a reference to a pork roast he attended while campaigning for his father, George. H.W. Bush, in 1980 -- long before adopting the Paleo regime.

“I went to the Muscatine pork roast,” he said, according to the New York Times. “I think twice.”"
1EWtyEC,2015-02-11 00:00:00,Officials: Kayla Mueller May Have Been Given to ISIS Commander - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/International/officials-kayla-mueller-isis-commander/story?id=28870880,"[This report was updated Feb. 11 to include a statement from the White House National Security Council.]

With the confirmed death of Kayla Mueller, new details have emerged about the American hostage’s experience in ISIS captivity, including the belief by some officials that she had been given over to a commander in the jihadi group.

""ISIS didn't see her as a hostage or a bargaining chip,"" a counter-terrorism official told ABC News.

""Reflections"" in the limited collection of intelligence in Syria -- like indirect indications of a person's presence somewhere, such as ISIS fighters referring to her in calls or spotted guarding a sensitive site where she might have been held -- indicated Kayla was still alive and sometimes in the company of an ISIS leader being actively tracked who had custody over her, possibly by forced marriage, officials told ABC News.

The U.S. has no ground-level intelligence from Syrian human sources or American spies and so relies on ""airborne collection platforms"" like satellites and drones, officials have said.

Mueller's family in a public plea to ISIS on Friday said the terrorists had referred to her as a ""guest"" in private communications.

In a letter written by Mueller last year and released by the family today, Mueller said she was ""in a safe location, completely unharmed [and] healthy.""

""I have been treated with the utmost respect [and] kindness,"" she wrote.

Matt Olsen, former head of the National Counterterrorism Center and current ABC News consultant, said ISIS is known to for the “practice of essentially selling off, or putting young women and girls in the company of ISIS militants.""

A former law enforcement official involved in the American hostage cases told ABC News Mueller was briefly able to communicate with some male hostages by passing them handwritten messages. For the most part, she was kept away from the other hostages, the official said.

Several counter-terrorism officials told ABC News there were ""a few ideas but no real clue"" of Mueller’s whereabouts with ISIS in Syria over the months since an August deadline for a $6.6 million ransom with accompanying death threat passed -- but U.S.-led airstrikes in Syria were carefully coordinated to avoid killing hostages.

""We haven't hit any areas where we thought she might be,"" another official said. In announcing Mueller’s death, ISIS claimed she had perished in a coalition airstrike launched by Jordan.

A few weeks ago U.S. officials ""lost fidelity"" on her status entirely, several officials confirmed.

The Mueller family had not received a proof of life, likely an audio recording of her voice, since last year, officials and a source close to the hostage case told ABC News. She also was never mentioned or shown in any of the brutal hostage execution videos released by ISIS.

But recently, evidence of a visual sighting of Kayla last fall in Syria was obtained by intelligence agencies and was deemed credible, several counter-terrorism officials said. But, since the sighting was months ago, it gave no hard indication of her location this year.

Her last proof of life was in May, and then the ransom demand and death threat deadline passed by in August apparently without her execution.

Then over the weekend, ISIS provided the family with ""information,"" including photographic evidence that convinced the U.S. intelligence community that Mueller had been killed, according to a senior U.S. official. U.S. officials said it has not been possible to determine when or how Mueller actually died.

Update: White House National Security Council Statement

Out of respect for Kayla's family, we have not shared details regarding her time in ISIL [ISIS] captivity. In addition, as we have consistently made clear in the past, we do not discuss intelligence. At this time, given the distress that anonymously-sourced reports regarding Kayla's time in captivity are causing her family, we are providing this comment with the Mueller family's consent.

Reports that have been published by certain news outlets regarding Kayla's time in ISIL [ISIS] captivity are speculative and unproven at this time. The U.S. Government continues to analyze any information regarding Kayla's captivity but has not corroborated any of the multiple theories regarding the conditions throughout the duration of her captivity.

For a first-hand account of Kayla's time in captivity, we encourage people to read the letter written by Kayla in captivity, which was released by Kayla's parents earlier this week."
1EWZarA,2015-03-27 00:00:00,Astronaut Scott Kelly Prepares for a Pioneering Year in Space on ISS - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/astronaut-scott-kelly-prepares-pioneering-year-space-iss/story?id=29844090,"Astronaut Scott Kelly is poised to break the record for time in space for a U.S. Astronaut when he launches to the International Space Station today.

That’s a year with no hot showers, cold beers or the touch of his family. Kelly’s girlfriend Amiko Kauderer said she can’t call him, but he can call her, so will keep her cell phone close. It will be tough, but she said the reunion when he comes back will be special.

""For me it’s like the most romantic long-distance relationship ever,"" Kauderer said.

There are some amenities on the space station -- the views are out of this world, zero gravity gymnastics, and being an astronaut is still an elite job. Kelly knows that duty on the space station can mean fixing the toilet one week and being out on a spacewalk the next week.

Scott, 51, and his twin brother, retired astronaut Mark, will both be human guinea pigs. NASA will be comparing what happens to Scott’s body and brain to those of his brother Mark, while Mark is on the ground.

Mark said this will double what we know about spaceflight and the human body. ""Maybe there is a little cliff out there that you fall off with regards to the radiation, bone mass, bone density, those type of things, so, I am all in,"" Mark said.

Scott admits it will be a tough year -- and he should know. He has pulled one six-month stint on the space station already. After ""about four months, you start thinking, you know, there is a lot of stuff I miss on Earth. I feel like I have accomplished everything I need to, and I am sorta ready to go home.”

On a year-long mission, the intense yearning to go home could come later, he said, noting he hopes that yearning comes about ""two-thirds of the way into the mission.""

""I am kinda hoping it occurs then,"" Scott said.

Flight surgeon Dr. Stevan Gilmore is overseeing the research for this year in space. He knows how tough zero gravity is on the human body, and what NASA needs to know before they send humans off on a three-year round trip mission to Mars. This, he said, is an important step.

“We want to understand, is there anything that pops up between the six- and twelve-month duration so that we know if there are any large barriers out there for new missions,"" Gilmore said.

NASA really wants this to lead to a Mars mission. That’s why Mark Kelly agreed to the research.

""We need to figure out how people are going to live in space for really long periods of time, especially if we want to send somebody to Mars. We want to one day build a base on the Moon. Our experience with long-duration flight is six months,"" Mark said.

Despite all the possible dangerous side effects, the twins said they believe they are blazing a path that will take humans into space. Mark admits he has the easy job saying on earth, but noted that without taking risks, ""we don’t go anywhere, we don’t learn anything, we don’t get better at anything. So, risk-taking has always been a part of the space program and always will, but in this case there is extra risk.”

What will Scott miss when he is in space for a year? All the holidays, his children’s birthdays, and good food, he said.

“The menu of food [in space] is not as large a variety as you would like, even though the weather inside the space station is generally perfect, you miss the rain, the breeze, the change of seasons,"" Scott said."

Bob Menendez Denies Wrongdoing as Feds Consider Corruption Charges - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/sen-bob-menendez-denies-wrongdoing-feds-corruption-charges/story?id=29449566,"Sen. Bob Menendez, D-New Jersey, is speaking out about the possibility of facing corruption charges that may come from an investigation into whether he received gifts from a Florida eye doctor in exchange for promoting the doctor’s business.

A federal official familiar with the case told ABC News a criminal charge is a “good possibility,” but a decision may be weeks away. Grand juries in Miami, Florida and in Newark, New Jersey have heard evidence against Menendez that centers on his relationship Dr. Salomon Melgen, a close Menendez ally and Democratic donor.

Late Friday night, Menendez forcefully denied any wrongdoing in a news conference, adamantly saying “I am not going anywhere.”

“Let me be very clear, very clear. I have always conducted myself appropriately and in accordance with the law,” Menendez told reporters in Newark, New Jersey.

Menendez said his close relationship with Dr. Melgen and his family dates back more than two decades. The New Jersey senator declined to answer questions about the case due to the “ongoing inquiry.”

At an event in South Carolina today, Attorney General Eric Holder declined to comment on reports he authorized federal corruption charges against the senator.

“I can’t comment on that,” Holder said.

Menendez, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has been at the forefront of two major foreign policy fights with the Obama administration in recent months. Menendez, who is of Cuban descent, is the strongest Democratic opponent of President Obama’s plan to normalize relations with Cuba. He also is leading efforts to impose new sanctions on Iran if nuclear negotiators fail to reach a deal."

Johnson, appearing in court for the first time, was expected to enter a not guilty plea, but the prosecution asked for a continuance so the investigation could continue.

Martese and lawyer Daniel Watkins agreed to this and his next appearance will be May 28. Attorneys hope that the Virginia State Police investigation will be done by then.

Nearly 100 supports showed up to the Charlottesville District Court, all dressed in black in a show of unity. The court appearance lasted all of 90 seconds.

Johnson, 20, was bloodied during an arrest near the campus last week, sparking protests on the campus over alleged police brutality as well as a state investigation of the incident. He was arrested outside a Charlottesville bar by state Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) agents who are charged with enforcing alcohol laws in Virginia.

In Virginia, there is no legal requirement that customers entering a restaurant where alcohol is served must be over the age of 21. So Johnson had every right to attempt to enter Trinity so long as he was using his lawful identification. Trinity’s decision to enact a 21 and over policy after 10 p.m., for busy evenings, did not make Johnson’s attempt to enter illegal."

""We never expected anything like this,"" said Jeb Barlow, who lettered at UNC from 1980-1982. ""But it doesn't surprise me that this was done.""

The trustee of Smith's trust, Tim Breedlove, told ESPN.com that the $200 checks were sent out on Monday to about 180 letter winners.

""This was the kind of man that he was,"" Breedlove said. ""It's one more example of his thoughtfulness.""

The letter addressed to Dante Calabria, who played on Smith's 1993 national title team, was circulated on social media Thursday. Smith's message was to ""enjoy a dinner out compliments of Coach Dean Smith.""

Said Serge Zwikker, who played for Smith from 1993-1997: ""My wife opened the letter and handed it to me. At first I didn't know what it was, but when it hit me, it put a tear in my eye. Even after he passed, he was still all about his players.""

Buzz Peterson, a roommate of Michael Jordan's when they played for Smith at UNC, also was awed by the gesture.

""I saw the check, and was like, 'What?'"" Peterson said. ""Then I started reading the letter, and I said, 'Wait now, you've got to be kidding me. This is unbelievable that he would do this for us.'""

Zwikker said that part of him doesn't like the fact that news about Smith's gesture has gone public.

""It's just not the way he would have wanted it,"" Zwikker said. ""I know he would have preferred to keep it quiet.""

Zwikker said the $200 check is unlike any other money he has received.

""I don't think I can cash this,"" he said. ""If anything, I will donate it to a good cause.""

Smith went 879-254 in his years at North Carolina, the only school at which he ever coached. The Tar Heels won the national title in 1982 and 1993.

1F0xEJ4,2015-02-03 00:00:00,Flood of Donations for Michigan Man James Robertson With 21-Mile Walk to Work - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/US/flood-donations-michigan-man-james-robertson-21-mile/story?id=28670981,"Evan Leedy, a 19-year-old Detroit college student, was on Facebook Sunday morning when he read a story about James Robertson, a 56-year-old factory worker who walks 21 miles each day to and from his job in Rochester Hills, Michigan.

“What he walks is like me walking to work every day and I honestly couldn’t believe that,” Leedy told ABC News. “I thought to myself, ‘What would I do if my car broke down?,’ and I thought, ‘I have my parents and I have money to get an Uber.’”

“This guy doesn’t have that and he didn’t quit,” Leedy said.

After reading the Detroit Free Press story on Robertson, Leedy saw in the comments that people were looking for a way to help so he started a GoFundMe page for Robertson, a complete stranger to him, within minutes of finishing the story.

“I initially set the goal for $5,000 just to get him something, bus fares and taxi rides,” Leedy said. “I went to go get ready and an hour later we had $2,000 donated already.

“I bumped it up to $10,000 and within four hours we had over $10,000,” he said. “I bumped it up again and by the end of the day we had over $30,000 and now it’s up to over $50,000.”

Leedy says he received a call from the corporate offices of Honda offering to donate a car, and a local Chevrolet dealership, Rodgers Chevrolet, has also already offered to give Robertson a car.

“We are in a position that we can help and we just want to pay it forward,” Angela Osborne, a customer service specialist at Rodgers, told ABC News. “His story really struck home.”

All the attention and donations are coming as a shock to Robertson, according to his friend and sometimes driver, Blake Pollock.

Pollock, a vice president of wealth management at UBS, started seeing Robertson walking on his daily commute a few years ago. When Robertson cut through the parking lot of Pollock’s office building one day two years ago, the banker stopped him.

Pollock told ABC News he learned that Robertson walked most of his 20-plus mile commute daily, leaving his home in Detroit early each morning to get to work at a $10.55 per hour factory job in time for his 2 p.m. to 10 p.m. shift.

Robertson then does the reverse commute on the way home, having to walk even further because the bus lines on his route do not run at night, according to Pollock.

“I said, ‘Next time I see you I’ll give you a ride,’” Pollock recalled. “A few months later I saw him literally standing on top of a snow bank and gave him a ride.”

Pollock estimates he has given Robertson close to 100 rides in the years since, even leaving his home at night to make sure Robertson gets home safely.

“I’m sitting in my warm house and I’m thinking this guy has five more miles to walk,” Pollock said.

Pollock has also over the years taken friends who could not believe Robertson’s story along with him on rides to show that Robertson does indeed make that commute daily. Most amazing to Pollock is that Robertson, who could not be reached today by ABC News, “thinks nothing of it.”

“He’s said, “I can’t imagine people who don’t work. I can’t imagine not doing that,’” Pollock said. “Nothing gets him down. “If it’s rainy, if it’s cold, he just always says, ‘Hi Mr. Blake.’”

“I get to sit in the car and have that inspiration right next to me,” he said of Robertson, who began walking to work a decade ago when his then-car broke down."

It all started with an allegation -- via anonymous email -- that Secret Service agents were “extremely intoxicated” as they drove through an active crime scene set up just outside the White House complex on the evening of March 4. But documents obtained by ABC News show that two senior Secret Service officials who believed the two agents involved in the now infamous incident were not intoxicated, based on their interactions with the agents that evening. The agents, Marc Connolly and George Ogilvie, had been accused of driving through the crime scene near a White House gate while possibly under the influence of alcohol after attending a retirement party for a colleague.

The documents were part of the material presented to the DHS Inspector General by the Secret Service. One of those documents details some of the recollections of Secret Service Deputy Chief Alfonso Dyson and Captain Michael Braun, both of the Uniformed Division.

“Deputy Chief Dyson advised that based on his conversation with DSAIC Connolly, it did not appear as though DSAIC Connolly [was] impaired,” according to Dyson’s account of his phone conversation with Connolly described in the document. Dyson called Connolly on the evening of March 4, after he was alerted to the incident. Connolly told Dyson that he had made a mistake, which Dyson believed to be referring to driving into the crime scene at that entrance caused by a suspicious package tossed at that location by a woman earlier that evening.

The document goes on to say, “Captain Braun advised that the driver of the [government vehicle] (ATSAIC Ogilvie) did not appear to be intoxicated.” And though Braun advised that Connolly’s eyes appeared glassy, he commented, “that he did not believe that DSAIC Connolly or ATSAIC Ogilvie was intoxicated.”

According to documents, Deputy Chief Dyson had been briefed on the incident on the evening of March 4 by Uniformed Division Inspector Keith Williams. Citing an “unknown source,” Williams said he was told Connolly, a passenger in the car, “smelled of alcohol,” the document states.

According to congressional sources, no other evidence other than the anonymous email and the unknown source has been presented to suggest that either agent was drunk. Multiple sources who have reviewed video of the incident tell ABC News that it does not provide any conclusive evidence of impairment.

The documents also show that the Connolly told Dyson that he and Ogilvie did not realize that the White House complex was under alert condition yellow due to the suspicious package investigation at that entrance. Only when they noticed that the security post was unoccupied did they check their BlackBerry devices and learn of the alert."

A jury ruled in favor of Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, which had been sued by Ellen Pao, the interim CEO of Reddit and former partner of the firm.

Pao, 45, filed her complaint in May 2012 against the prominent venture capital firm, which is based in Menlo Park, California, near the headquarters of Facebook, one of the many tech firms in which it has invested.

""I have told my story and thousands of people have heard it,"" Pao said, according to The Associated Press. ""If I helped to level the playing field for women and minorities in venture capital, then the battle was worth it.""

The partners of Kleiner Perkins issued a statement after the verdict, saying: “Today’s verdict reaffirms that Ellen Pao’s claims have no legal merit. We are grateful to the jury for its careful examination of the facts. There is no question gender diversity in the workplace is an important issue. KPCB remains committed to supporting women in venture capital and technology both inside our firm and within our industry.”

Here’s what you should know:

Kleiner Perkins hired Pao in June 2005 as chief of staff for one of the managing partners, John Doerr. After working at a handful of technology firms and a law firm, her title with Kleiner was junior partner. Pao studied electrical engineering at Princeton and went to Harvard Law School and Harvard Business School.

""She was told if she was successful in this role, she would move to a full-time investing role after three years,"" according to her lawsuit.

In her suit, Pao said another partner who is no longer with the firm made ""inappropriate sexual approaches"" during a business trip to Germany in February 2006, and she ""rebuffed his advances.”

From March to October 2006, that former partner, Ajit Nazre, allegedly pressured Pao to ""have a sexual relationship with him"" and falsely told her that his wife had left him, the suit said.

Pao ""eventually succumbed to Mr. Nazre's insistence on sexual relations on two or three occasions,"" but in October 2006 she told him she would ""no longer have a personal relationship with him,"" the suit says.

Kleiner Perkins has denied all of Pao's claims in court. Nazre could not be reached for comment.

Over the course of five years, Nazre ""engaged in retaliation against"" her, including excluding her from ""numerous"" business meetings and removing her from business email discussions where she had initially been included,"" the court filing stated.

Pao alleged that she repeatedly complained to superiors about this treatment but was told ""that she should just accept it,"" the suit said. She also alleged ""inappropriate"" behavior by other male employees. The firm has said that Pao didn't complain about alleged harassment until late 2011.

Six months after filing suit, Pao was fired in late 2012, which Pao said was in response to her lawsuit, while the firm claims she was fired for her performance.

Christina Lee, a spokeswoman for the firm, said in a statement to ABC News, ""This suit is completely without merit and has no basis in the law. KPCB has a well-established record of championing women in our firm, our portfolio companies and the overall industry. We look forward to clearing our name in court.""

In one alleged example, on Valentine's Day in 2007, a senior partner came into Pao's office, the suit states. He gave her a book called ""Book of Longing,"" by Leonard Cohen, which contained sexual drawings and poems with ""strong sexual content,"" and invited her to dinner, explaining that his wife would be out of town, the suit states. The firm has stated that Pao never previously complained about the book and that it had been purchased by the partner's wife and was given because of a shared interest in Buddhism.

The suit said Pao ""believed that the retaliation and gender discrimination were affecting her compensation at KPCB, because women generally were not treated equivalently or promoted to Senior Partner based on their gender.""

Pao alleged she was criticized during performance reviews for qualities that male employees were praised for, such as being ""aggressive,"" according to the lawsuit. On the stand, one of the supervising partners, Ted Schlein, said Pao was ""entitled,"" ""territorial"" and that big-picture thinking ""wasn't part of Ellen's genetic makeup,"" according to Re/Code.

Kleiner Perkins says that 20 percent of its investing partners are women, compared to the industry average of 6 percent, which comes from the “Diana Report: Women Entrepreneurs 2014,” from Babson College.

“A little bit after 9 a.m. eastern time [Jan. 31] U.S. Special Operations Forces conducted a strike south of Mogadishu using unmanned aircraft and several hellfire missiles,” Pentagon Press Secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby told reporters at a Pentagon briefing. “This operation was a direct strike against the al-Shabab network and the terrorist group’s chief of external operations and planning for intelligence and security... We are still assessing the results of the operation and will provide additional information when and if appropriate.”

Kirby said the strike demonstrates the reach of the US government and its commitment to fighting terrorism.

Al-Shabab is a Somalia-based terrorist group with close ties to al Qaeda.

Kirby said the strike was conducted in coordination with the government of Somalia and said it did not require putting American troops on the ground. He added there were no known civilian casualties as a result of the strike."

“Yes, he was aware of her email address. He traded emails with her,” Obama spokesman Josh Earnest told ABC’s Jonathan Karl. “But he was not aware of her personal email server or that she was using it exclusively for all her business.”

In an interview Saturday, Obama said he learned of his secretary of state's private email address use through recent news reports, ""the same time everybody else learned it.""

Earnest explained that the president was referring to details of her email system and the fact that she had not been in compliance with State Department policy for nearly six years after failing to submit the records for transfer to government computers.

Clinton has called for the public release of 55,000 emails turned over to the State Department for archiving. Her team handpicked the messages off her private server that pertained to official business; Clinton's camp said roughly 10 percent were of a personal nature and not handed over.

""I'm glad that Hillary [has] instructed that those emails about official business need to be disclosed,"" Obama said Saturday.

Earnest said an independent, third-party review of Clinton's private server should not be required, but suggested that the White House would not oppose one if she elected to do so.

The former Secretary of State has remained mum on the email controversy. She has yet to explain why she exclusively used private email through a server built inside her New York home while Secretary of State, or why it took six years to submit the records as required under the department policy she oversaw.

“Good night my darling” hangs on their bedroom door.

Hundreds of others are scattered around their apartment.

Maryse Wolinski told ABC News her husband had always written notes to her but started to do so increasingly in the past six years.

“When I was out late for work or with friends, I would come home and read his notes,"" she said. ""I wasn’t happy when I didn’t get one!”

“He was a wonderful man,” she added. “Many of my friends were jealous of me, because he was simple, curious, a good listener.”

Maryse Wolinski always responded to the notes, and when her husband died, she found a folder with all the notes that she wrote.

Talking about her late husband is painful, she said.

“We’ve been together for 47 years, we built a life together. Losing him is like losing a part of me,” Maryse Wolinski added.

“Our couple was strong because we based our relationship on freedom and equality but also because we were different from one another,” she said.

They had the same values, she added, but not always the same ideas, especially regarding his cartoons.

She said “a couple is like a cathedral, it takes a very long time to build.”

Together, they had reached the top."

After he and his former wife ended their relationship, the Colorado-based college admissions counselor noticed a skill he had been lacking in -- styling his toddler’s hair.

“I have her [Izzy] most of the time,” Wickherst said. “I used to just part her hair. Then one day I started trying to put pony tails in and for some reason, I couldn’t figure it out.”

After a few failed styles and even one botched pony-tail-with-a-vacuum trick, Wickherst decided to enlist in the help of the cosmetology students at IntelliTec College, where he works. And his newfound skills have been generating a lot of buzz on social media.

“I asked them to give me some pointers,” he told ABC News. “After meeting with a student I learned a bunch of different styles. I also found it was a bonding experience between me and my daughter.”

Since the summer time, Wickherst has spent a number of hours perfecting various hair styles for his toddler. A few of which being a fishtail braid, French braid, a waterfall braid, and a bun.

“She always says ‘daddy, put a bun in my hair,’” Wickherst said. “Sometimes she’ll ask for braids.”

Since perfecting his new talent for styling his toddler’s hair, Wickherst has been sharing his creations on his Facebook page.

His posts have attracted quite a bit of media buzz -- something he said he doesn’t quite understand.

“It’s really crazy that it has gotten all the attention it has,” Wickherst said. “All I did was I took an interest in doing my daughter’s hair. It shows people that dads can do this kind of stuff and I absolutely love it.”

Wickherst said he'll continue to try new hairstyles on his daughter by looking for suggestions on social media.

I take note of his physicality because I know Nathan Jones was born biologically female as Natalie.

After much soul-searching and many consultations with therapists and doctors, Natalie’s parents made the brave, yet still controversial decision to allow Natalie to join the ranks of the first generation of transgender kids. Nathan wanted to transition socially and medically before reaching adulthood.

""I've always felt like I've had a boy's brain,"" Nathan said. ""And I always felt like I was trapped in this girl's body.""

Though born a girl, Natalie Jones (a pseudonym) was just 4 years old, declaring, “I’m a boy."" In the second grade, just to clear up any confusion, Natalie took black crayon and in big, bold letters wrote “I AM NOT A GRIL” (You’ll excuse the misspelling of a second grader.) and “I AM A BOY”. His teacher scooped up the notes and sent the child to the school counselor. But instead of getting in trouble, the guidance counselor gave her good guidance, providing a haven.

The story would not have been possible without the quiet tenacity of ABC News' ""Nightline"" producer Melia Patria. Nathan’s family trusted her enough to allow to Patria to follow Nathan’s transition for four years. Often with just a DV camera in hand, Patria returned to Nathan’s story at crucial moments and managed to capture his remarkable evolution: From a seemingly depressed, self-conscious, monosyllabic 14-year-old into the self-confident young man I see before me.

Our cameras were there when he legally changed his name to Nathan; when he embarked on testosterone therapy; and when he had his breasts removed at age 16. He had been a brooding teenager who strapped down his breasts and wore hoodies with shoulders hunched over on scalding summer days for fear of showing his breasts. After the “top surgery,"" as it's called, he lost the bindings and the hoodies. His posture changed, and he felt comfortable enough to go swimming for the first time in years.

“It's been forever since I've been at a pool and felt comfortable being in a pool with my shirt off,"" Nathan said. ""I can't even describe the feeling. It's kind of life changing.”

Nathan’s parents ask that you have tolerance in hearing his story. And before judging, know this: In the last six months at least six transgender teens have commit suicide according to news reports, and it's often because they're unsupported by parents or peers. In fact, a staggering 41 percent of transgender youth will attempt suicide before age 25.

Dr. Marvin Belzer runs the largest transgender youth clinic in the country as the Director of Adolescent Medicine at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles. Belzer pointed out, ""They get into adolescence, and their body starts going through the wrong puberty. And it just becomes a panic, and they get depressed and suicidal. The percentages [of] how many were spat on and how many were hit, how many had to drop out of school, are horrendous.""

Nathan, too, was teased and physically bullied in school until he eventually decided to be home schooled. Though he lost touch with that second grade counselor who made him feel safe all those years ago, we wondered if we could find her. And sure enough we did. We quickly made arrangements for a reunion.

Amy answered the door with a squeal of delight, ""Look at you! Oh, my gosh! Oh, that's my-- my wish and my dream come true."" With a laugh, she added, “You've changed just a little.”

Within moments, there were tears in her eyes.

Amy remembers one day in the sanctuary of her office when then Natalie said to her, ""My mom says I'm always gonna be a girl,"" and the young child cried.

Nathan said, ""You sat me down and you just told me that there were other people like me, and I'd never heard that before. I never knew that there was anyone else like me. I thought I was the only one. And that one thing -- it has kept me going all these years, just the fact that you said that to me meant so much.""

“What Natalie was telling me was so real,"" Amy said. ""And I never knew until this moment that you'd never had anybody say that to you.""

Nathan's parents join the conversation, and Amy tells us that when she retired after a 20-year career, she kept only one file: Natalie/Nathan's file. She hoped that this day might come.

Amy said simply, ""I couldn't not know the end of this story.""

It's been a decade since Nathan, then Natalie, was sent to Amy's office for passing out those black crayon notes in class. Amy pulls out that one student file she had taken with her. Inside were the notes that the second grader had scrawled all those years ago with the so vivid, simply, yet powerful declaration, which could not be more clear, ""I am not a girl."" ""I am a boy.""

""There was a lot of time where it was really hard, and it just kept me going,"" said Nathan.

“That means a lot to me,” replied Amy, smiling broadly. ""And look how handsome you are. Oh, my gosh!""

""Just thank you for everything,"" added the young man, who is now so well-adjusted and boasts a wide set of friends. ""You never made me feel like I was wrong and so many people had made me feel like I was wrong. But I got so much comfort in having you.""

Nathan continued, ""I don't want another kid to have to go through life thinking they're different. They need that one person that says, 'You -- you're all right."""
1F6Nx2B,2015-03-10 00:00:00,'Superbug' Scope Maker Had Altered Design to Make Cleaning Easier Even Before Outbreaks - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Health/superbug-scope-maker-altered-design-make-cleaning-easier/story?id=29417816,"The endoscopes allegedly responsible for a wave of ""superbug"" outbreaks had been redesigned in recent years in the hopes of making them easier to clean and less likely to spread bacteria from patient to patient, ABC News has learned, but the modifications might have created different challenges as the scopes continue to transmit antibiotic-resistant bugs.

Patients undergoing procedures with duodenoscopes at hospitals in Los Angeles, Connecticut, Pittsburgh and Illinois have come down with antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections over the last two years, according to local health authorities and the Journal of the American Medical Association.

While the tip is enclosed, it is not ""sealed like a bubble or a can"" because tiny tools need to emerge to perform biopsies and complete other tasks, said Dr. J. Todd Weber, chief of the prevention and response branch in the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's division of healthcare quality promotion.

""That presents cleaning challenges because it is not an open surface,"" Weber said. ""There's a mechanism inside there. It's not easy to get the appropriate brushes into that space.""

Duodenoscopes are inserted through the mouth to access a patient's small intestine and ducts in the liver and gallbladder. They contain a light, a camera, a catheter and other tiny equipment used in 500,000 procedures a year, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Unlike scopes used in colonoscopies and upper endoscopy procedures, duodenoscopes used a complex elevator wire channel to access the tiny ducts.

It's this complexity that makes them tough to clean, the FDA said in its latest safety communication since an outbreak of CRE, an antibiotic-resident bug, at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center left two duodenoscopes patients dead and infected five others undergoing procedures. (It’s unclear what role the bug played in the two scope patients’ deaths.)
The hospital said it traced the bacteria back to two duodenoscopes that were new models and had only been in use since June. Local health officials added that the scopes were cleaned in accordance with manufacturer guidelines.

""For example, one step of the manual cleaning instructions in device labeling is to brush the elevator area,"" the FDA communication said. ""However, the moving parts of the elevator mechanism contain microscopic crevices that may not be reached with a brush. Residual body fluids and organic debris may remain in these crevices after cleaning and disinfection. If these fluids contain microbial contamination, subsequent patients may be exposed to serious infections.""

Older duodenoscope models have exposed elevator wire channels at the tips so the manufacturers -- FujiFilm, Olympus and Pentax -- each decided to enclose these channels in their newer models. Fujifilm was the first to do this in 2004, followed by Pentax in 2009. Olympus, the manufacturer named in the UCLA outbreak, was the last to do this, and had filed paperwork with the FDA only last fall, initially thinking it wasn't necessary to get clearance for the change, ABC News has learned.

""The elevator wire channel port is now sealed so separate cleaning is no longer necessary,"" Olympus said in a product brochure announcing the change. ""The result is faster, easier cleaning that makes scope reprocessing more efficient.""

When 39 duodenoscope patients became infected with antibiotic-resistant bacteria at one Illinois hospital in 2013, researchers at the CDC determined that the scopes had been cleaned properly but they found antibiotic-resistant E. coli and another bacteria around the enclosed channel two months after the scopes were last used. A manufacturer was not named in the study.

""The complicated design of duodenoscopes makes cleaning difficult,"" the researchers wrote in the discussion section of the study. ""It appears that these devices have the potential to remain contaminated with pathogenic bacteria even after recommended reprocessing is performed.""

Since the UCLA CRE cases were announced in February, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center has had four patients test positive for CRE, and Hartford Hospital in Connecticut has announced that 300 of its patients were exposed to E. coli. Both exposures were linked to duodenoscopes.

Still, neither doctors nor health officials want to pull the scopes because these infections are rare, and the devices allow doctors to treat patients with deadly diseases and infections without surgery, increasing their chances of survival.

Duodenoscope procedures are not elective, and usually necessitated by a serious symptom, Weber said.

""The value of the procedures performed utilizing these devices far outweighs the unfortunate events that have occurred,"" said Dr. Michael Kochman, who chairs the American Gastroenterological Association's Center for GI Innovation and Technology.

FujiFilm declined to comment, and neither Olympus nor Pentax were immediately available for comment.

Olympus said in a prior statement to ABC News that it is aware of reports involving its duodenoscopes, and it is working with the FDA, medical organizations and customers to address concerns. It is also making supplemental educational materials available to customers.

""While all endoscopes, including duodenoscopes, require thorough reprocessing after patient use in order to be safe, the Olympus TJF-Q180V requires careful attention to cleaning and reprocessing steps, including meticulous manual cleaning, to ensure effective reprocessing,"" the company said."

You may have noticed there are a lot of people out there wearing blue today and tweeting selfies with the hashtag #LIUB for ""light it up blue.""

Today is World Autism Awareness Day, and even global landmarks like the Empire State Building and the Prince's Palace of Monaco are celebrating with special blue lights for the occasion. The United Nations declared April 2 World Autism Awareness Day in 2007, and we've been celebrating it ever since.

Autism is a developmental disability that usually manifests around the third year of life, according to the U.N. Symptoms vary widely across the spectrum but generally include engaging in repetitive behaviors, and having difficulties with communication and social interactions.

It affects all ethnic, racial and socioeconomic groups, according to the U.N.

One in 68 children born in the United States is diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which released findings based on 2010 surveillance data.

Parents are often the first to notice the symptoms, such as when a child doesn't make eye contact, according to the nonprofit Autism Speaks. Concerned parents shouldn't panic, but they should have a talk with their family pediatrician, experts say."

Finally ready to hear it, her family sat around the hospital bed as she pulled out her laptop, found the document and began to read.

""It pains me to admit it, but apparently, I have passed away,"" she wrote in the obituary published in the Jacksonville Times-Union.

""It was one of the most special moments of my life to hear my mother tell her life story in her words, in her way, in what were incredibly difficult circumstances,"" Upright told ABC News. ""So as tragic and as sad as death is, her courage and her bravery in facing her death and in wanting to leave a mark her way is incredibly special to the family.""

Phillips, 69, of Orange Park, Florida, died just 29 days after being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, but her sassy personality lives on in what has become a viral self-written obituary. By Thursday, the Times-Union's Facebook post of the obituary had garnered more than 4,000 ""likes"" and her story had gone national.

""We all think our mom is the best - as they should,"" Upright said, adding that Phillips was a teacher until the very end. ""To have that mom and a moment of clarity and a moment of grace with a sense of humor -- which is how she raised us -- was just truly something remarkable.""

Phillips details growing up as a middle child, marrying the ""man of [her] dreams"" and falling in love with her grandchildren. She wrote about twirling a baton to the tune of ""Dixie"" for the Miss North Carolina pageant, and laughing at her granddaughter for shaving off one of her eyebrows. She also apologized to a friend for dating a boy she had a crush on.

""And if you don't believe it, just ask me,"" Phillips wrote. ""Oh wait, I'm afraid it's too late for questions. Sorry. So ... I was born; I blinked; and it was over. No buildings named after me; no monuments erected in my honor. But I DID have the chance to know and love each and every friend as well as all my family members. How much more blessed can a person be?""

Upright said her mother was proud of the obituary and would have been ""tickled pink"" to learn how much readers loved it. And it's helped the family cope at least a little.

""It helps put a smile on our faces a little bit sooner than we thought,"" Upright said. ""I hate that she's gone. I hate that that's reason for this. But by golly, I could not be more proud."""
1F78l6i,2015-04-02 00:00:00,Kentucky Fan Gets Life-Saving Stem Cell Donation From Univ. of Wisconsin Student - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Health/kentucky-fan-life-saving-stem-cell-donation-univ/story?id=30067763,"This Saturday when the University of Kentucky basketball team faces off with the University of Wisconsin in the NCAA tournament semi-finals, die-hard Kentucky fan Scott Logdon may think twice about rooting against the Wisconsin Badgers.

Nearly two years ago, Logdon was given a life-saving donation of stem cells that helped combat his acute myeloid leukemia. The donor of those cells turned out to be 22-year-old Chris Wirz, a student at the University of Wisconsin.

Logdon remembers feeling mixed emotions when the Kentucky wildcats won. Later, when he found out about his donor, he joked, “That must have been the Badger blood in me.”

Logdon’s ordeal started in the fall of 2012, when he was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia after mistaking early symptoms for strep throat. Logdon said his doctors told him chemotherapy could only keep the cancer at bay. A full stem cell transplant would be needed to cure him of the deadly disease.

Logdon’s doctors hoped one of his two siblings might be a match, but neither was able to donate. Longon’s family and community rallied in the small town of Saldasia, Kentucky, and registered over 120 people who would be willing to donate stem cells or bone marrow.

But no one who registered was a good match for Logdon.

“[The doctors] went to the national bone marrow registry to try and find the match,” the father of four said. “I had to go back to the hospital every 30 days [for] maintenance chemo; it was a very long wait.”

The monthly chemotherapy meant Logdon’s immune system was extremely fragile because of both the cancer and the chemotherapy treatments.

“Waiting on the transplant it was four months, but it seemed like an eternity,” Logdon said.
Logdon got the call in January that a match had been found on the national registry and that it was a “10 out of 10” perfect match.

Logdon underwent the successful transplant and then spent nearly a year recovering as his immune system built itself back up after the cancer treatment.

“It’s like you’re building an entire new immune system,” Logdon said. “My immune system had to recalibrate. It was a long process, [but] we always wanted to meet the donor.”

After waiting the required time, Logdon and his family sent letters to his stem cell donor through the national registry service. Weeks after sending the letters and days after Kentucky beat Wisconsin in the NCAA, Logdon got an email from Wirz, a junior at the University of Wisconsin.

Logdon said Wirz told him he signed up for bone marrow on a whim after his cousin put together an event to raise awareness. If picked from the registry, donors are asked to give either blood stem cells or bone marrow.

“[His cousin] explained it to him it’s a 1 in 100,000 chance you’ll ever get picked,” Logdon recalled.

Wirz has not responded to ABC News’ request for comment.

After connecting with Wirz over the phone, Logdon’s family hosted the college student and his mother for a few days this summer. Logdon said he and his entire family met Wirz in person to thank him for taking part in the donation.

This Saturday as Kentucky and Wisconsin play a rematch of last year’s Final Four game, Logdon says he’s staying loyal to his home team but he might be in contact with Wirz.

“I’m sure we’ll be texting during the game or talking on the phone,” Logdon said. “We’ll be talking some smack during the game, I’m sure.”"

The college announced that the individual has been identified as a result of its investigation but the person's name has not been released.

What, if any, punishment the student will face remains unknown.

""The student is no longer on campus,"" Duke spokesman Keith Lawrence said, declining to give any further explanation though noting that no punishment has been issued since the individual has not yet gone through the school's judicial hearing system.

""The student will be subject to Duke’s student conduct process,"" the school statement said.

Lawrence told ABC News that he could not speculate on the possible punishment in this case. In the past, conduct boards made up of a mix of students and faculty members have issued punishments for students found guilty that range from some form of disciplinary action to suspension or expulsion.

The investigation into the noose, which was reportedly found hanging from a tree early Wednesday morning, is ongoing as officials said they must determine if the student acted alone.

The student may also be subject to criminal charges, depending on what state and federal officials determine."

A suggested ""fix"" to the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), which was signed into law by Indiana Gov. Mike Pence today, also prohibits discrimination based upon race, color, religion, ancestry, age, national origin, disability, sex or U.S. military service. But legal experts say that won’t hinder the original intentions of the law -- which was intended as a legal defense for people or employers who felt that their religious beliefs were being infringed.

“If you had a religious claim that says, 'I don’t have to pay attention to a gay rights statute,' that claim will lose. Those laws were never going to do that,” Robin Fretwell Wilson, a law professor at the University of Illinois told ABC News.

“Once you put the carve-out there, you inoculate [the] law from a claim that was wrong all along,” she said.

State legislatures in Indiana and Arkansas may have drawn the most attention by passing versions of the ""religious freedom"" law this week, but similar religious freedom laws are in place in 19 states across the country, and 10 others have similar bills in the works, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

Douglas Laycock, a law professor at the University of Virginia, said RFRA claims are rarely brought to court and generally come in the form of “low-profile conflicts between diverse religious practices and diverse laws and regulations.”

“There are remarkably few cases and there are even fewer wins for the religious side, but they're extremely important to the people affected,” he told ABC News.

One example of a RFRA case that was upheld that was cited by both Laycock and Wilson came in a case involving an Amish population that argued with local authorities who wanted to put bright orange reflective triangles on the back of their buggies.

Other examples included a case when neighbors bristled at the idea of a church feeding the homeless in the building’s basement or when someone is fired because they refuse to work on the Sabbath, Laycock said.

The amendment was announced this morning following meetings between state representatives and business leaders who had threatened to pull their business from the state if exemptions were not made. Pence signed it into law later in the day, saying in a statement that ""resolving this controversy, making clear that every person feels welcome and respected in our state is best for Indiana."""

The family of Louis Jordan, 37, reported on Jan. 29 to the Coast Guard that he and his ship ""Angel"" were missing. In audio released by the Coast Guard, Jordan's father told his son that they thought he was dead.

""Oh man, nice to hear your voice,"" said his father, Frank Jordan. ""People've been praying for you.""

His father also thanked the captain of the Houston Express for spotting his son.

""You're a good man,"" he said. ""I'm grateful for the system that we have.""

Coast Guard Lt. Krystyn Pecora said Jordan's family was driving to Norfolk to see their son.

Pecora, who said the details about how he went missing are to be determined, said there was ""no reason to question what happened and we'll get more information when they can speak to him.""

The helicopter left Air Station Elizabeth City, North Carolina, at about 3:40 p.m., the Coast Guard said, and met the Houston Express before transporting him to Sentara Norfolk General Hospital in Norfolk. He was being treated for a shoulder injury and was being checked for other injuries, the Coast Guard said."

Scientists have been examining the mysterious Kennewick skeleton since it was found near that city in 1996. The skeleton dates back 9,000 years and appears to be of a different ethnicity than other indigenous people, according to Henry Schwarcz, a geochemist and professor emeritus at the School of Geography and Earth Sciences at McMaster University in Ontario, Canada.

Schwarcz, who studies the diets of ancient people by analyzing isotopes in bones, said he was amazed after analyzing the collagen in the bones of Kennewick man in an effort to identify his paleodiet.

""This guy was apparently living on a diet almost exclusively of marine foods; foods that come from the ocean,"" Schwarcz said.

The results are surprising because the man was found 350 miles inland along the Columbia River near plains that were teeming with terrestrial wildlife. While he could have been subsisting on salmon swimming upstream, he was likely not venturing to hunt in the fields.

""He was choosing not to eat that wildlife,"" Schwarcz said.

The geochemist explained that the Kennewick man may have ""had a prejudice against eating footed creatures. That’s not really something that we [see.]""

Kennewick said it's unclear why he didn't try to branch out and eat other wildlife in the area.

The time period for the Kennewick skeleton is just under the timeline cited by followers of the ""paleo"" diet, who aim to eat the same way people ate 10,000 to 2.5 million years before agriculture took hold.

Ken Sayers, an anthropologist at Georgia State University in Atlanta and one of the lead authors of the recent Quarterly Review of Biology of how ancient people ate, said there is little evidence to suggest early humans subsisted on a specialized diet.

“Whatever angle you chose to look at the diets of our early ancestors, it’s hard to pinpoint any one particular feeding strategy,” Sayers said.

Smiley was born without eyes, but is still able to work as a St. John’s Ambulance service dog in Ontario. The dog’s owner, Joanne George, rescued the dog from a puppy mill, when he was about 1 or 2 years old.

“He was very scared, [the dogs] had never been out of that barn,” George recalled, adding that Smiley quickly bonded with another one of his dogs, a deaf Great Dane named Tyler.

“Tyler was so bouncy and crazy and happy go lucky and [Smiley] turned into the same dog,” George said. “He came out from underneath the tables where he was always hiding.”

George said seeing Smiley interact with crowds made her realize he would be a perfect therapy dog. She now brings the dogs to hospitals and schools in the area and says the dog almost always brightens people’s days.

She said at one nursing home, she realized how even a small visit with Smiley could make people happy.

“There was this man Teddy, [he had] no speech, no communication at all,” George said of one memorable nursing home resident. “[The staff] had never seen Teddy smile before.”

But once Smiley came up to Teddy, George said the staff was amazed. “[Teddy] smiled when Smiley got into his vision,” George said

George said after caring for Smiley for 10 years, she has learned a lot about how to care for blind dogs.

“Somebody through St. John’s Ambulance is wanting to adopt a dog that’s blind,” George said. “I told her all those things don’ t be his eyes, don’t run his life, don’t’ keep him in a bubble.”

She said it's key for Smiley to figure out how to get around on his own. George said Smiley is mostly able to get around on his own without too much difficulty.

""Does he bump into things? Of course, he does. But he does it very carefully,"" George said, noting the dog’s ""high"" steps when he walks. ""He’s feeling with his feet."""

The BEA agency issued a statement Friday, one day after officials announced that the plane’s black box data recorder had been found.

According to investigators, initial readings of the recorder show that the pilot used the automatic pilot to put the plane into a descent -- then repeatedly adjusted the automatic pilot during descent to speed up the plane.

Düsseldorf, Germany, prosecutor Christoph Kumpa, speaking Thursday, said co-pilot Andreas Lubitz had researched information on how cockpit doors worked.

The officials said they had recovered a tablet computer from Lubitz's home that had been used between March 16 and 23, the day before the crash. Kumpa said Lubitz, 27, had also used the tablet to do research for ways to carry out suicide -- suggesting a degree of premeditation.

The Germanwings plane that departed from Barcelona crashed en route to Dusseldorf on March 24 with all 150 people on board killed on impact.

German authorities previously said Lubitz had been treated by a psychotherapist because of previous suicidal tendencies and that he had deliberately flown the jetliner into a mountain.

Bill Moore was 20 years old in 1944 when he wrote a letter to a young woman named Bernadean that he met while on furlough during the war, not knowing that he would go on to marry her.

The letter was found in the sleeve of a record that was purchased by a stranger in a thrift shop. The stranger went on a search to reunite the letter with its author.

Moore, now 90, now lives in an assisted care facility in Aurora, Colorado. His daughter was contacted shortly before Valentine's Day this year by the person who unintentionally bought the letter, and Moore was overcome with emotion when he read it for the first time in 70 years.

""I was really surprised because I would have no way of knowing that it would show up in the way it did,"" he told ABC News' Denver affiliate, KMGH.

Moore was fighting in Patton's Third Army at the time and what he didn't know when he wrote that letter was that he would go on to marry the woman he called ""my darling, lovable, alluring, Bernadean"" and have three children together.

They were married for 63 years before she died in 2010.

""I loved her ... she loved me and that's all I can tell you is the heartache of not being with her all the time,"" he told KMGH."

The acting legend, 69, admits that along with the iconic hit ""Ghostbusters,"" he has fans who still come up to him today and bring up other classic movies like ""The Substitute,"" ""The Crow,"" and ""The Hand That Rocks the Cradle,"" along with shows like ""Oz.""

Now, Hudson is starring in a new movie ""To Hell and Back"" on TV One that premieres Saturday.

""It's nice to do a movie and be able to get behind it, talk about it and mean it,"" he told ABC News of the modern film, which is a take on The Book of Job. ""It's really for me, one of the fascinating books of the Bible. It starts out with God and the devil making a bet.""

The movie features Hudson's character at the height of life, but then goes through tragedy.

""When this happens, it's all about how do you hold on to your sanity and belief in life,"" he said. ""When I first got the script, I loved it and I really thought of my grandmother, who raised me. She was very religious. I don't consider myself very religious. I do think of myself as spiritual... I thought of her and I know this is something she would have enjoyed seeing. I knew this is something she would have wanted me to do.""

Recalling his time in ""Ghostbusters,"" Hudson said he's thankful to have been in a role fans still love three decades later after the 1984 release.

""It's so funny, we were driving here [in NYC] and going past the building where that ghoul was and we had our war with the Gods, and saw the church that the marshmallow man stepped on. I see that stuff and it makes me laugh. I knew when we were shooting the movie, it would register and be a 'hit,'"" he said. ""But most hits run for six, seven months. I had no idea 31 years later, I'd be sitting here talking about this movie.""

In fact, Hudson said fans take things to the next level with their love for his character Winston and the movie.

""Everybody finds something in it,"" he said. ""I've seen every kind of Ectomobile you can imagine ... I went to buy a car, and the salesman said, 'We have a mechanic, he's a big fan and he has a tattoo of you.' I was, 'Really, a tattoo of me!'""

Hudson said a big 6'4"" guy came walking in and pulled his pant leg up and from ""his ankle to his knee is my face.""

""Winston was his favorite character,"" he said. ""It's just taken a life of its own.""

Hudson couldn't be more gracious and thankful for the fans who have kept ""Ghostbusters"" alive.

One woman was such a fan that when she met the actor at a convention, she had a unique request.

""I love conventions because you get a chance to meet the fans and actually talk to them,"" he said. ""This girl came up with her fiance and they were getting married at the convention. She wants me to give her away. That was around the time I would wear my 'Ghostbuster' outfit ... I told her, 'This really seems like something you should call your dad for.' She said she really wanted me too.""

She showed him a tattoo on her ankle of his signature.

""So, I did, I gave her away and Margot Kidder from 'Superman' overheard this so, she was in the wedding as well!"" he added.

He even said parents who met on their first date to see ""Ghostbusters"" 30 years ago came up to him and said they named their son Winston!

""These things register with people in ways and I'm very happy it's positive,"" he said. ""For me, that's important.""

The 4-year-old ephemeral messaging app took a big leap this week by releasing its first ever transparency report and unveiling a sophisticated slate of new security features.

From Nov. 1, 2014, until Feb. 28, 2015, Snapchat said it received 375 requests from law enforcement for information in the United States. The company reported complying with 92 percent of those queries.

The release of the transparency report brings Snapchat in line with common practices used by Google, Facebook and other large technology companies and will be updated bi-annually.

Along with the report, Snapchat announced it would roll out a slate of new initiatives to ensure users' silly photos and scantily clad selfies remain private and unable to be grabbed by third-party apps.

Among the new features are a bug bounty program that will offer incentives to coders around the world who flag any potential vulnerabilities in the app.

Snapchat also vowed a complete shutdown of third-party apps, many of which have been used unscrupulously by Snapchat users to grab and save photos that friends sent to them with the intention of only showing them for a few seconds.

Snapsaved, a third-party app, was hacked last year, resulting in thousands of private photos and videos being posted online.

It's something Snapchat said it is working to make sure never happens again by ensuring it becomes harder for third parties to write apps that can be used on Snapchat.

In an interview in Medium, Snapchat's vice president of engineering, Tim Sehn, said the company has a ""competitive advantage that we care that much about users' privacy and security.""

""We care enough to delete their data. That is something that most companies don’t do because that data is valuable. It costs us something to do that,"" Sehn said. ""So it's definitely part of the ethos that has been there since the start."""

Thankfully, the hybrid was recovered Tuesday night when a man in St. Louis saw a suspicious car in his neighborhood and called 911, Schoenig told ABC News today.

""The cops showed up and the kids were all arrested and the car was retrieved,"" said Schoenig, 40.

But the story doesn't end there. On Wednesday -- which also happened to be April Fools' Day -- Schoenig was shocked when she saw her recovered car pull up.

""[The thieves] had spray-painted the rims, put details on the whole car,"" she said. ""They were planning on tinting the windows.""

The married mother of two decided to make light of the situation and posted a photo of her with the car on Facebook, thanking ""the car thieves for pimping out my vehicle for me.""

""Everybody was laughing, I was having fun with it,"" she said. ""It looks like it's a pimped out vehicle ... but they still did a lot of damage to the car.""

The car is getting restored to its original look, but the Facebook photo went viral, remaining the perfect snapshot for how to stay positive in a rough situation.

""I think part of why it's gone as viral as it has is because I have a really good support team of friends who were helping me not break down when I wanted to not be happy with people,"" Schoenig said. ""It reminded me that that's how people really are. And it made me go back to putting out good energy.""

""I'm a strong believer in karma,"" she added.

""It was good people that found my car. It was good people that surrounded me and encouraged me to think positive thoughts. That was the hardest part because I was upset with people, humanity,"" Schoenig said. ""The truth is that there's still more good people out there than bad. Regardless of how a situation looks, we can still kind of have fun with it."""
1FahFKC,2015-03-11 00:00:00,Hillary Clinton's Emails: Unanswered Questions About Deleted Correspondence - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/hillary-clintons-emails-unanswered-questions-deleted-correspondence/story?id=29538638,"Hillary Clinton was likely hoping to put the issue of her use of a private email account to rest by hosting a news conference, but more than a few questions remain unanswered.

The former Secretary of State, who addressed the media shortly after giving a speech at the United Nations about women's empowerment, did not use a government email account during her tenure as the U.S.'s top diplomat.

She said today that the reason for the use of one, personal account was convenience, though that does not explain the issue fully.

Here are some of the questions that remain unanswered following Clinton's news conference.

Clinton argued that she had a number of emails about personal issues that should not be considered part of the public domain.

""No one wants their personal emails made public, and I think most people understand that and respect that privacy,"" Clinton said today.

Clinton’s word is really the only check that the public will have on this front. The emails that she chose not to keep included emails ""about planning Chelsea's wedding or my mother's funeral arrangements, condolence notes to friends, as well as yoga routines, family vacations, the other things you typically find in inboxes,"" she said.

Yes, but only the emails that Clinton and her team have deemed related to her work as Secretary of State, and then from there, only what the State Department approved. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said that once cleared, the 55,000 pages of emails that Clinton handed over will be shared publicly on a government website though not for several months.

When it comes to her personal emails, the public will never know. Today, Clinton ruled out an independent review of her server.

Clinton amassed 62,320 emails between March 2009 and February 2013 and fewer than half of those had to do with work.

After today's news conference, Clinton's team released a statement clarifying the exact number of work and personal emails, saying that 30,490 were handed over to the State Department because they related to work and 31,830 were deemed ""private, personal records.""

Her camp clarified that the timeframe for these emails does not exactly match up to her tenure as Secretary of State -- she was sworn in on Jan. 21, 2009 -- but for roughly the first two months she used the email address she had left over from her time as senator. However, her ""practice"" of emailing individuals who used a government account in order to ensure that they were saved is the only record that exists for that time period. Once she transitioned from that Senate account she no longer had access.

That would mean that she sent 21.5 work emails and 22.46 personal emails per day.

There was no official answer to this. Clinton said that she chose to use one email address out of ""convenience.""

""Looking back, it would have been better if I'd simply used a second email account and carried a second phone, but at the time, this didn't seem like an issue,"" she said.

Clinton claims that she always knew that her emails to government employees, who used state.gov email addresses, ""were captured and preserved immediately on the system at the State Department.""

Clinton maintained that she ""fully complied with every rule I was governed by."" She did not directly address a 2005 update in the Foreign Affairs Manual codified by the State Department that ruled employees could only use private email accounts for official business if they turned those emails over to be entered into government computers. That ruling also forbade State Department employees from including ""sensitive but unclassified"" information on private email, except for some very narrow exceptions. She did, however, note that she never sent classified information via email.

She said that the personal server set up at her house in Chappaqua, New York, was already in place for her husband and his post-presidential career. That said, The Wall Street Journal reported that Bill Clinton has only sent two emails in his entire life, so his use of the system does not necessarily mean that the system is inherently secure.

When asked whether or not her email plan was acceptable by the White House's standards, Clinton said ""there are different rules governing the White House than there are governing the rest of the executive branch.""

""It had numerous safeguards,"" Clinton said of the server stored at her house. ""It was on property, guarded by the Secret Service, and there were no security breaches. So, I think that the use of that server, which started with my husband, certainly proved to be effective and secure.""

During today’s news conference, Clinton touted the ""convenience"" of using one device, but it seems her habits have changed.

Just two weeks ago, during a talk in Silicon Valley, Clinton said that she had both an iPhone and a BlackBerry, though she did not say when exactly she began using both devices.

She did not answer when asked if this issue has impacted her thinking about her expected presidential run, but Republicans are jumping into the controversy.

Rep. Trent Gowdy, who heads the House committee investigating the attack on the American consulate in Benghazi, Libya, said that ""there is no way to accept"" Clinton's explanation and is calling for an independent third party to review her server.

Laboratory tests confirmed two cases, with results for three others still pending, officials said. However, the remaining three have been diagnosed with measles based on clinical and epidemiological criteria.

Health officials warned at a news conference that the current outbreak could grow.

""We’re talking about a highly contagious disease, one that is particularity threatening for those people who have not been vaccinated,"" said Dr. Terry Mason of the Cook County Department of Public Health. ""There’s likely to be more cases. We shouldn't be surprised by that.""

Infants younger than 12 months old are particularly susceptible to the measles virus because infants are not traditionally given the first dose of the vaccine until they are a year old. The cause of the outbreak has not been determined, according to health officials.

A measles outbreak that started in mid-December in the Disneyland theme park in California has already infected more than 100 people in 14 states. Health officials said they were trying to determine if this new measles cluster was related to that outbreak.

Although an adult in the same county was diagnosed with measles earlier this month, health officials said that the cases were likely not linked.

In addition to the children who were diagnosed, health officials are monitoring another seven to 10 children who were also exposed to the virus at the day care center and were too young to have received their first measles vaccine.

Prior to this outbreak, Dr. Rachel Rubin of the Cook County Health Department said there had been only 10 measles cases in the last five years.

""These were sporadic cases,"" she said at a press conference. ""We haven’t seen anything like this in many years.""

A spokeswoman for KinderCare said it was working closely with the state and county health departments to respond to the outbreak and was informed of the first two infections Thursday.

""We wish both children a speedy recovery and are hopeful they will be able to rejoin us in the center soon,"" read part of a statement from KinderCare. ""We are following Public Health officials’ guidance and excluding unvaccinated children and staff who may have been exposed to the virus from our center.""

Any staff or students at the facility who have not received the measles vaccine have been asked to stay home for 21 days until Feb. 24.

Measles is an extremely contagious virus that infects 90 percent of unprotected people who are exposed. Symptoms of measles include fever, runny nose, conjunctivitis and a red rash."

The helicopter was reported missing at 8:30 p.m. Tuesday and debris was located at about 2 a.m., base officials said in a statement.

Mike Spaits, Eglin Air Force Base public affairs officer, told ABC News that “some human remains have been found.”

There are no further details released at this time. Officials will be holding a news conference later today.

""There was fog. I do not know at this time if it was a contributing factor, but when our search-and-rescue personnel arrived on scene there was very limited visibility,"" Eglin Air Force Base spokesman Andy Bourland had said earlier in the day.

Bourland said the helicopter did not issue a distress call. Some debris has been located east of the Navarre Bridge and it is expected that debris will continue to appear in the area moving toward the bridge.

The Marines are part of a special operations group based at Camp Lejeune in Jacksonville, North Carolina, and the soldiers were from a Hammond, Louisiana-based National Guard unit, officials said.

The crew of a second helicopter was recovered and is safe, Bourland said.

The accident, which happened during a training mission on a beach between Pensacola and Destin, is under investigation.

Jackson's resignation, which was announced this afternoon by city spokesman Jeff Small, makes him the sixth person who has been fired or forced to resign since the report was released March 4 detailing what it described as rampant racial bias in policing in the St. Louis suburb.

The letter announcing Jackson's resignation described it as ""a mutual decision by both the Police Chief and the City's administration.""

Lt. Col. Al Eickhoff will take over as the acting Chief of Police starting Thursday as the city launches a national search for a new chief of police, the letter stated.

Ferguson Mayor James Knowles said tonight that Jackson's one-year severance will be on par with his salary, which is roughly $100,000.

""The chief is the kind of honorable man that you don't have to go to, he comes to you when he knows this is something we have to seriously discuss,"" Knowles said.

Knowles added that the decision came ""after a lot of soul searching"" but that Jackson ""felt this was the best thing to move forward.""

Jackson had initially came under fire in August for his department's handling of the shooting death of unarmed teenager Michael Brown. In November, Jackson told ABC News that he had no plans to resign.

""I do not intend to resign or step down,"" he said at the time. ""I'm going to see this through.""

Knowles said that Eickoff joined the Ferguson police force in early August before Brown's shooting.

The incident, which was first reported by the Washington Post, is being investigated by the Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General.

The White House said today that President Obama is aware of the allegations and supports Secret Service Director Joe Clancy’s decision to turn the investigation over to the DHS Inspector General for a thorough review.

“We are aware of the alleged incident,” an Obama administration official told ABC News. “At the request of the Secret Service Director, Joe Clancy, the Department of Homeland Security’s Office of the Inspector General is conducting an investigation into the allegations. We’re not going to comment further while that investigation is ongoing.”

Both agents have been reassigned to non-operational assignments pending the outcome of the investigation.

Serova was the last of the astronauts removed, smiling broadly as she sat in the chair bundled up against temperatures a few degrees below freezing.

The return to Earth took about 45 minutes. The atmosphere helped slow down the Soyuz until parachutes opened and the spacecraft glided to a landing.

The astronauts were then taken to recliner-style chairs set up near the capsule to begin their readjustment to gravity and undergo brief medical tests. All three appeared in good condition.

Three other astronauts remain aboard the space station. They will be joined by three others on March 27; two of those -- Scott Kelly and Mikhail Kornienko -- are to spend a full year on the ISS.

Randy Schmitz of Orland Park, Illinois, was on vacation with his family in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, last summer when he stopped on the boardwalk at a hot sauce store called Pepper Palace. He signed up for the store's hot sauce challenge, where contestants dip a toothpick in the hot sauce and put it on their tongues.

""I've done some other challenges in the past - this was possibly the worst one,"" Schmitz, 30, told ABC News today. ""I made it the five minutes. My sister then said she wanted to take the challenge, but I said, 'You might want to hold off, I'm feeling really sick.'""

""My head was feeling really off,"" he said. ""Next thing I know, I wake up in a stretcher in a hospital hallway covered in vomit and I had no clue what had happened.""

Schmitz had suffered a seizure. After an MRI, he learned he had a cancerous brain tumor.

Within a few days, Schmitz was back home in Illinois, where he had surgery to remove the tumor at Northwestern Memorial Hospital, doctors said.

Schmitz finished radiation treatments just in time for his wedding. Now enjoying life as a newlywed, Schmitz is thankful for the hot sauce he says saved his life.

That's the message from ""Breaking Bad"" creator Vince Gilligan, who says some fans of the AMC drama have been throwing pizzas on the roof of the Albuquerque, New Mexico, residence that stood in for the fictional meth dealer's home.

For those of you who didn't watch the show, there was a memorable scene in which Bryan Cranston's Walter, frustrated with his wife, tossed a pizza into the air, and it landed on the roof of his house.

Speaking on the official podcast for the ""Breaking Bad"" spinoff ""Better Call Saul,"" Gilligan said the woman who owns the home in real life has mentioned the pizza-tossing incidents, and that some fans have been rude to her.

He warned, ""There is nothing original or funny or cool about throwing a pizza on this lady’s roof. It’s just not funny, it’s been done before, you're not the first.""

Actor Jonathan Banks, who played the intimidating Mike Ehrmantraut on ""Breaking Bad"" and is reprising the role on ""Better Call Saul,"" chimed in, ""And if I catch you doing it, I will hunt you down."""

Ashley Summers vanished in July 2007 when she was 14 after getting into a fight with her mother, and police say they have a new lead in the case.

Ashley’s step-grandmother was online in January and saw a surveillance photo that was posted on a website showing criminals wanted in Rhode Island. She believed that the similarity to her long-lost granddaughter was indisputable, so she contacted authorities.

The bereaved grandmother isn’t the only one who sees the connection, with FBI Special Agent Vicki Anderson saying the similarity is “just amazing.”

“She looks a lot like her,” Anderson told ABC News. “If you look at her eyebrows; you look at her hairline, it looks a lot like her.”

The surveillance footage was posted by the Warwick, Rhode Island, police department in connection to the thefts of purses from cars in a parking lot near a gym. The cards from those purses were used to obtain money from a nearby ATM, Warwick police Capt. Christopher Stewart told ABC News.

The woman took an undisclosed amount of money from the ATM Oct. 22, 2014, and although the investigation into the car break-ins is ongoing, the Warwick police are not actively involved in the search for Summers. They also have no hard leads on the identity of the woman at the ATM or the man seen with her.

Until now, the FBI’s Anderson said, the biggest lead in the Summers investigation came with the 2013 discovery that three long-missing women, identified later as Michelle Knight, Amanda Berry and Gina DeJesus, were being held at a home in Cleveland.

“When the girls escaped, and we heard that there were three of them being held, we knew Amanda and Gina but we weren’t sure who the third person was,” Anderson said of how there was speculation that Summers could have also been held by Ariel Castro. “We just assumed, ‘Oh, my gosh, Ashley!’”

The tip from the Rhode Island ATM case seems like the most promising lead yet, Anderson said, adding authorities are not going to stop until they at least get the identity of the person in the surveillance footage.

“It’s going on eight years, but this to us is a significant lead and we have to follow,” she said. “We have to find this young woman.”"

But officials from the Federal Highway Administration cautioned that the agency's ""work is not done,"" as it continues to evaluate a series of serious and fatal crashes involving the guardrail system that have been reported throughout the county.

The agency announced this week the formation of a task force that is currently reviewing actual crash data and will later determine if any further testing of the ET-Plus would be warranted.

The test results, however, were good news for the beleaguered company, Trinity Industries, that makes the guardrail system and recently lost a federal lawsuit which alleged they made changes to the design to save a few dollars but never notified the government.

The Trinity ET-Plus ""meets the applicable crash test criteria,"" Federal Highway Deputy Administrator Greg Nadeau said this morning in a call with reporters, adding that a much-debated eighth and final crash test that appeared to show severe damage was also given a passing grade.

In a statement to ABC News, Jeff Eller, spokesman for Trinity Industries said ""The ET Plus System has been successfully crash tested more times than any product of its kind. It has an unbroken chain of eligibility for federal-aid reimbursement from the FHWA.""

The company has continually insisted that the tests have validated its long-standing position that their product is safe and performs as intended.

But critics of the guardrail system - and the testing process - reacted swiftly following the announcement.

""FHWA's unacceptable patterns of inadequate oversight unfortunately continues today,"" Sen. Richard Blumenthal said in a statement to ABC News.

""The FHWA has given the ET-PLUS a passing grade after allowing the manufacturer to conduct sham tests rife with flaws.""

""For more than three years, despite a growing chorus of concerns and regular red flags from dozens of states, a federal court, counties, and potential victims, the agency that attests to the safety of these guardrails - the FHWA - has done little to rid the road of these potentially dangerous devices,"" said Blumenthal.

The final results of the tests have been anticipated since late January, with all eyes on that eighth and final test, which critics of the ET-Plus guardrail system say was a “clear” failure.

In that particular test, upon impact, the small test vehicle appeared to be severely damaged on the driver’s side after striking the guardrail. Helicopter footage shot by a local ABC station captured the test and the impact – a sight Sen. Blumenthal told ABC News in February he considered “hideously shocking.”

“The damage done to the driver’s side is very simply supposed to not happen and so that final test is deeply disturbing and gives me strong reason to say there ought to be more testing,” said Blumenthal in the days after the test.

But in today's call, FHWA officials say they analyzed the probability of a lower leg injury in that crash and found it to be low - specifically, .03 percent.

Victims of accidents involving the ET-Plus have suffered lower leg injuries when the guardrail penetrated the vehicle and impaled them, sometimes causing total amputation.

Officials confirmed today that there was no penetration of the car by the guardrail in the final test.

Trinity president Greg Mitchell addressed the controversy surrounding the final test in a letter sent to state departments of transportation after the FHWA announcement, writing, ""we are aware the eighth and final crash test will be the topic of much criticism and discussion.""

""But let there be no doubt - the eighth crash test passed,"" the letter reads. ""In the experts' opinion, occupants in this car would not have been seriously injured in this impact.""

Sean Kane, a safety advocate who also works with plaintiff's lawyers suing Trinity, told ABC News he is disappointed but not surprised by FHWA's findings.

""Simply because it didn’t penetrate the vehicle enough to seriously injure the driver in that test should not mitigate concerns about this failure,"" Kane said.

The government ordered the eight crash tests after Trinity was found by a federal jury late last year to have committed fraud when it modified the ET-Plus guardrail’s end terminal a decade ago but failed to tell state or federal officials about the change at the time.

Accident victims and critics say the modified guardrail end terminal can malfunction when struck from the front, sending pieces of metal through the car and potentially killing or dismembering its occupants.

The ET-Plus and its potential hazard to American drivers was the subject of an ABC News investigation last year.

An update on the ABC News 20/20 report will air on Saturday, March 14.

When the new crash test plan was publicly announced last November, FHWA's Nadau made clear to reporters if the ET-Plus didn’t perform, it would revoke its eligibility for federal reimbursement when used on U.S. highways.

“This is pretty much pass-fail,” Nadau said then.

Prior to the crash test results, 42 states had frozen installation of new ET-Plus guardrails pending the results. There was no immediate word on how any of the states have reacted.

Questions about transparency and integrity of the crash tests – as well as the relationship between FHWA and Trinity Industries – have dogged the federal agency and last week, six U.S. Senators urged the Government Accountability Office to investigate FHWA following what they called “troubling developments regarding the FHWA’s evaluation of defective ET-Plus guardrail and end terminals.”

Jane Mellow, FHWA spokesperson, told ABC News of the Senators’ comments, ""We welcome the interest of Members of Congress and the GAO review of the process for, and the FHWA’s role in, determining whether roadside safety devices meet the safety criteria adopted by AASHTO and followed by state DOTs. We look forward to sharing the extensive research and analysis FHWA has conducted surrounding this process.""

Federal Highway Administration has posted video and technical data of all eight crash tests on its website.

Officials from the Department of Transportation, which oversees FHWA, have insisted that regardless of the final results, the investigation into the ET-Plus is far from over and that it will continue to look at information it has gathered from state DOTs and the public, including accident reports."

Twitter launched its Periscope live streaming app today gunning for the estimated hundreds of thousand users and others that upstart streaming app Meerkat has attracted during its first month in existence.

Broadcasts from around the world are featured on the home screen of the Periscope app showing off everything from friends dining at a fast food restaurant to a guy lounging in bed with his dog to a live view of the Eiffel Tower.

Users have the option of choosing to push a link to their Twitter followers, allowing them to tune in to the live stream.

While Meerkat was the darling of the South by Southwest Interactive Festival, the biggest complaint users have with the app has been that by the time they click a live streaming link in Twitter, it's already dead.

Periscope differentiates itself by offering broadcasters the chance to let viewers replay their stream when it is complete, while Meerkat is more bare bones, taking an ephemeral approach to live video.

Audience love is also a huge aspect of the Pericscope app, which allows viewers to tap the screen and send hearts to the broadcaster, letting them know they appreciate what they're doing.

On popular streams, such as those belonging to magician David Blaine and astronaut Chris Hadfield, who have been testing the app, the hearts float like a constant stream of bubbles across the screen.

Twitter revealed earlier this month it had acquired Periscope. Around the same time, Twitter stripped away Meerkat's access to Twitter's social graph.

The move means users will have to individually re-build their network of friends inside of the app as opposed to getting a populated list of people they follow on Twitter. Meerkat users can still push links from their live streams to Twitter.

While Periscope is aesthetically nicer to look at and offers more users engagement opportunities -- it's unlikely to be a Meerkat killer.

The company announced today it has received an investment for an undisclosed amount led by Greylock Partners -- providing more capital for Meerkat continue on its explosive growth path."

Francis traveled to Rebibbia Prison today to celebrate the Mass of Our Lord’s Supper with inmates. During the liturgy, he washed the feet of 12 inmates there, reported Vatican Radio.

Holy Thursday, also known as Maundy or Great Thursday, is the traditional celebration of Jesus’ last super with his apostles as told in the Gospels of the New Testament. It comes during the church’s holiest week of the year, between Palm Sunday and Easter.

According to the Gospel of John, Jesus washed his apostles’ feet at the Last Super (13: 2-17).

Last year, the pope washed feet at a mass held a rehabilitation facility for the elderly and those with disabilities. The year prior, Francis performed the ritual at juvenile detention center. Francis broke with tradition there, washing the feet of women instead of just men.

On his first Holy Thursday as pope in 2013, Francis encouraged priests not to be just managers, but to go to the ""’outskirts’ where there is suffering, bloodshed, blindness that longs for sight.”

Pope Francis will celebrate Good Friday by leading thousands in the Stations of the Cross at the Colosseum in a tradition that dates back to the 18th century."

Some 60,000 of the leaflets were dropped over Ar Raqqa, Syria early on the morning of March 16, officials said.

The leaflets were dropped by a single U.S. Air Force F-15E fighter aircraft carrying a PDU-5B leaflet canister, according to the Pentagon.

Col. Steve Warren, a Pentagon spokesman, told reporters today that the drop was intended to dissuade potential ISIS recruits from joining the group.

""The message of this leaflet is if you allow yourself to be recruited by Daesh you will find yourself in a meat grinder,” said Warren, using the Islamic acronym for the group.

The leaflet shows a room identified by a sign with the arrow as a ""Daesh Recruiting Office,"" and the meat grinder is labelled ""Daesh.""

Drake Kramer, 21, of San Antonio, was last seen Sunday morning checking out of the Bright Angel Lodge, officials said.

His father, Robbin Kramer, said his son told him Monday that ""he was at the Grand Canyon and he needed to be back with Mother Earth and set his soul free. At that point we really started getting worried and started calling and trying to get people to look for him.""

The family reported Drake Kramer missing on Monday, and search efforts and a missing person investigation are now under way.

""He posted on his Facebook when he was out here with his aunt last time: 'Wish I could stay.' And he had other posts about ... places he'd like to see, like the Redwood Forest, before he dies,"" Robbin Kramer said.

It’s just “too soon” to know whether the man committed suicide or was the victim of a brutal murder, FBI Special Agent-In-Charge Don Alway said. An autopsy report with preliminary results is expected sometime next week, but a gun was not involved, authorities said. Some 30 agents have been assigned to the case.

Mississippi Man Found Hanging from Tree

The man found hanging has now been identified as 54-year-old Otis Byrd. Always said investigators are ""still trying to find out more about"" his personal and professional life ""to identify potential reasons"" for his death.

Byrd had served a lengthy sentence for murder. In 1980, he stole $101 from a woman and fatally shot her, according to court records obtained by ABC News. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to life behind bars, but he was subsequently released on parole, the records show.

Authorities will be looking to see if that case may have played any role in his death. At the same time, the FBI and Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division have opened a preliminary civil rights investigation, focusing on whether Byrd's race may have played a role in his death.

Lucas said Byrd's family was unaware of any threats made against him.

""We got a young man that died and we're going to determine how he died and if someone did that, that person will be brought to justice and he will be punished for that,"" said Claiborne County Sheriff Marvin Lucas.

Byrd was last seen March 2 and, within days, his family filed a missing person report with the Claiborne County Sheriff’s Office. The FBI and Mississippi Bureau of Investigation were then asked to help, the FBI said in a statement. Byrd's body was found about a half-mile from his home.

Earlier Thursday, the Claiborne County Sheriff's Office and the Mississippi Wildlife Fisheries and Parks conducted a ground search for Byrd."

""This new date is a reminder that there could well have been many species of Australopithecus extending over a much wider area of Africa,"" Ronald Clarke, a professor in South Africa who discovered the fossil, said in a statement.

Using a radioisotopic dating technique, scientists analyzed 11 rock samples that surrounded the fossil to determine the approximate time when Little Foot was first buried underground.

Conrad Claus, one of the attorneys who represents Erich Nowsch, 19, told ABC News he questions why descriptions of events leading up to the fatal shooting of Tammy Meyers changed, why Meyers and her children would behave the way they purportedly did, and why a composite sketch of a suspect done before his client was arrested Thursday does not more closely resemble Nowsch.

The timeline of events in the case, which police have said is based upon eyewitness accounts from Meyers' children, has evolved over time.

Initially, police said it appeared someone followed Meyers, 44, and her 15-year-old daughter home from a road-rage incident following a late-night driving lesson on Feb. 12.

Later, police said Meyers and her daughter fled the alleged road-rage incident but were not followed home. The daughter told police the ""road rage"" involved the driver of the other car getting out of the driver's seat and saying, ""I'm gonna come back for you and your daughter,"" according to a police warrant issued Friday.

After returning home, Meyers and her armed, 22-year-old son went looking for the person who allegedly threatened Meyers and her daughter, the police said in the revised timeline. According to an arrest report released Friday, they found that person two blocks from their home.

Nowsch told his friends, according to the report, that he saw a car with a gun pointed at him coming toward him. The report alleged Nowsch opened fire on the approaching vehicle driven by Tammy Meyers. Meyers and her son then drove home, according to the police report, only to have Nowsch appear at their home and open fire. The son returned fire, police said, and when the shooting stopped Meyers was critically injured. She died at a hospital two days later.

After the arrest of Nowsch, who lived near the Meyers' home, Meyers' husband, Bob Meyers, revealed another new detail: He said his wife actually knew the teen suspect and even ""fed him, she gave him money.""

“We know this boy. I couldn’t tell you this before. He knew where I lived,” Bob Meyers told reporters outside his house Thursday. “We knew how bad he was, but we didn’t know he was this bad, that he’s gotten to this point.”

Police said they only learned of the Meyers’ personal connection to Nowsch hours before the arrest.

Besides expressing doubt about whether the “road rage” occurred, Claus questioned why Meyers and her daughter would not have gone to the police immediately after allegedly being threatened, or why the family wouldn't have told the police who allegedly confronted the mother and daughter if they knew the person.

The Las Vegas Metro Police Department was not available for comment Saturday.

The Meyers family has made no public statements since Thursday.

Nowsch is charged with murder, attempted murder and illegal discharge of a gun, and expected to make his first appearance in court Monday."
1FP2GqK,2015-02-23 00:00:00,FDA Says It Knew Scopes That Allegedly Spread 'Superbug' Could Transmit Bacterial Infections - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Health/fda-knew-scopes-allegedly-spread-superbug-transmit-bacterial/story?id=29107807,"The revelation that contaminated endoscopes were cleaned according to manufacturer instructions but still allegedly caused seven people to become infected with a deadly drug-resistant bacteria has raised questions about whether the scopes are too difficult to clean.

Seven people have become infected with the drug-resistant ""superbug"" known as CRE at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center after undergoing endoscopy procedures, and CRE may have played a role in two of its patients' deaths, hospital officials said Wednesday afternoon, adding that 179 people were exposed to the germ.

The scopes -- called duodenoscopes, which are inserted by mouth to access patients' small intestine, the pancreas and the liver -- were new and had only been in use since June, but they were cleaned in accordance with manufacturer guidelines, officials said yesterday. The hospital said they traced the bacteria back to two endoscopes manufactured by Olympus Corporation of the Americas.

The Food and Drug Administration told ABC News that it has been aware of cleaning issues and bacterial transmissions associated with duodenoscopes for more than a year.

""The CDC first alerted the FDA to a potential association of multi-drug resistant bacteria and duodenoscopes in fall 2013,"" an agency spokesperson told ABC News. ""The FDA has been actively working with federal partners, manufacturers, and other stakeholders to better understand the issues that contribute to the infections and what can be done to mitigate them.""

The FDA issued a safety communication about the duodenoscopes Thursday, explaining that they are used in about 500,000 procedures a year, but meticulous cleaning and disinfecting ""may not entirely eliminate"" the risk of transmitting infection. From January 2012 through December 2014, the FDA received reports of 135 patients suspected of contracting germs from reprocessed duodenoscopes, the agency said.

According to the CDC, almost every state has had a confirmed case of CRE, but state health departments are not required to notify the CDC about CRE infections.

Last month, a report revealed that 23 endoscopy patients at a Seattle hospital were infected with the antibiotic-resistant bacteria between 2012 and 2014. Eleven additional patients with CRE at the hospital died, but it's hard to say whether the superbug played a role in their deaths. Similar incidents have occurred in Pittsburgh and Chicago.

Duodenoscopes are made by various manufacturers. One lawyer told ABC News he may sue the endoscope manufacturer, Olympus, because he believes it was used on one of his clients who later died after contracting the superbug CRE at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center and on another, a teen, who has been hospitalized on and off for three months after being infected with the bug.

Olympus did not respond to repeated requests for comments about this possible lawsuit, but the company said in a statement to ABC News that it is aware of reports involving its duodenoscopes, and it is working with the FDA, medical organizations and customers to address concerns. It is also making supplemental educational materials available to customers.

""While all endoscopes, including duodenoscopes, require thorough reprocessing after patient use in order to be safe, the Olympus TJF-Q180V requires careful attention to cleaning and reprocessing steps, including meticulous manual cleaning, to ensure effective reprocessing,"" the company said.

Dr. Michael Kochman, who chairs the American Gastroenterological Association's Center for GI Innovation and Technology, said possible transmissions associated with duodenoscopes came to light last year, and since then, his organization has been working on sponsoring a meeting between the FDA, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, infectious disease specialists, gastroenterologists, endoscope companies and others. The meeting is scheduled for March 21.

""The AGA is really pushing toward a stance of no toleration of device-associated infections,"" Kochman said, explaining that that may mean redesigning the scopes, finding new ways to clean them, or finding technologies to rapidly test the devices between each use. ""It's a complex issue without an easy solution.""

He said duodenoscopes appear to have nooks and crannies that can harbor bacteria, but to stop using them would be ""a major, major step back for patient care."" Procedures involving these scopes allow doctors to treat patients with deadly diseases and infections without surgery, he said. And using other methods would actually lead to more patient deaths.

""The value of the procedures performed utilizing these devices far outweighs the unfortunate events that have occurred,"" Kochman said.

Kochman said patients undergoing routine colonoscopies and upper endoscopy procedures have nothing to fear because duodenoscopes are not used."

The 3,500-mile trip from California to New York is the longest automated drive ever attempted in North America.

Delphi Automotive PLC's vehicle is the driverless-car making the trip, according to a press release.

Delphi's Chief Technology Officer Jeff Owens said the car has been successfully tested on streets in California and Las Vegas, but the cross-country trip will be the car's ""ultimate test.""

""The vehicle will be challenged under a variety of driving conditions from changing weather and terrain to potential road hazards -- things that could never truly be testing in a lab,"" the release says.

The car is supposedly able to navigate 4-way stops, merge onto highways and even maneuver around bicyclists -- all without a driver.

There will be a driver in the car ready to take over if need be, Delphi spokeswoman Kristen Kinley said. The driver can take control of the car immediately in case of emergency, she said.

The coast-to-coast trip is scheduled to start near the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco on Sunday."

Police said officers uncovered a hidden underground cave with live ammunition, illegal gambling machines and a surveillance system.

Officers Robert Chavez and Angel DeLaFuente went to the home after a neighbor reported people yelling and a woman screaming for some time that sounded like it was escalating, the Fresno Police Department wrote on their Facebook.

A crying woman who appeared frightened along with upset children met the officers when they arrived, the Fresno Police Department said. The distressed woman did not want to tell the officers what was going on nor let them in, the department added.

The cops saw two people run through the house and thought someone was hurt, so they entered the home but ""strangely could not find the people inside,"" the Fresno Police Department news release stated.

Police continued their search outside the home and discovered several marijuana plants in a detached garage, police said. The cops then received information about a chicken coop leaning against the garage and sitting on skateboard wheels, the department added.

Officers rolled the coop -- exposing a staircase and underground cave, where the two suspects running earlier were hiding, Fresno Police said, adding the suspects were taken into custody without incident.

Before entering, Fresno firefighters made sure the cave was structurally safe for the officers to enter and they eliminated the possibility of a drug lab after testing the air, the Fresno Police Department said.

“It was very narrow, and it took a little bit of agility, but once down inside the space, it was like being in Forestiere Underground Gardens,” Battalion Chief Thomas Cope told ABC News affiliate KFSN. Forestiere Underground Gardens is a manmade underground attraction in Fresno reminiscent of ancient catacombs.

In the makeshift cave space, officers found TV monitors set up as part of a surveillance system involving several cameras around the home, tools, two rifles and illegal gambling machines, police said.

""The area was taped off and deemed unsafe,"" the Fresno Police news release stated, adding that Fresno Fire and Code Enforcement will be following up with the home owner.

Three suspects were arrested on various child endangerment, illegal gambling and weapons charges, police said.

Police said Daniel Marquez was arrested on three counts of felony child endangerment; Kue Vang on one count of gambling machines, two counts of filing down gun serial numbers and three counts of child endangerment; and Lee Khammany on a probation violation.

All three were booked into Fresno County Jail, authorities said. It is not known if they have entered pleas.

The Fresno Police Department news line and the Fresno Fire Department did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for additional comment."

She had three chances to guess the price of the car and started at the top with $19,849. That was wrong. But for some reason, the model took off that price, then took of the one below it without prompting. The second price, $21,960, was the correct answer.

Kay Hafford, 28, was driving to work Friday when another driver allegedly shot her from his vehicle.

She was taken to the Memorial Hermann Texas Trauma Institute where her condition improved throughout the weekend. She had been listed in good condition Sunday morning before she was discharged later Sunday afternoon.

The altercation took place after Hafford got onto the interstate and honked her horn at a driver in a white SUV, police said.

Harris County assistant Chief Deputy Mark Herman said the suspect then starting heckling Hafford, before shooting her.

Hafford didn't realize she had been shot at first. She pulled over her car and called 911 after the suspect fired one shot at her right window -- only realizing while on the phone that she was bleeding.

""She blacked out several times at the scene but she was coherent enough to give investigators some information about the case,"" Herman said.

No suspect has been arrested yet, police said. But, the suspect was last seen Friday driving what police believe was a white Chevy Tahoe."

In a speech carried live on Iranian TV, he said, “We have secured our nuclear rights, the removal of sanctions and constructive engagement with the world.”

He said the agreement showed the P5+1 had accepted enrichment on Iranian soil, and in so doing, agreed that Iran is not a threat to anyone.

Addressing Iran’s hardliners, Rouhani said “some think we have to fight the world or surrender. We think there is a third way: cooperation. The West sanctioned us to make us surrender, but saw that we would not give in… The world should know we stand by our commitments. But the other side must also meet its commitments.""

And for the first time, he hinted at more to come -- saying the nuclear talks were the first step towards constructive interaction with the world: “It’s not just the nuclear issue. ... This is the first step towards the constructive cooperation and interaction with the world. In today’s world, security not possible without cooperation and coordination ... will improve relations ... with countries we have tense relations.""

Until now, both sides have compartmentalized the nuclear file -- keeping it separate from the other issues.

The framework agreement makes clear that sanctions on Iran for terrorism and human rights abuses will remain. Rouhani signaled clearly that he wants any nuclear agreement to be just the start."

Keonna Thomas, 30, was charged today for allegedly conspiring to provide material support to the group now so infamous for its brutal propaganda videos and the havoc it’s wreaking in war-torn Syria and Iraq.

Last year, Thomas repeatedly posted pro-ISIS messages on social media, and she was ultimately in contact with a known ISIS fighter in Syria and other radicals around the world, according to charging documents.

At one point, the ISIS fighter asked her if she wanted to become a martyr, authorities said.

“[T]hat would be amazing ... a girl can only wish,” she allegedly responded.

If convicted, Thomas faces 15 years in prison.

On Thursday, the FBI in New York arrested two women who were allegedly planning to detonate a bomb somewhere in the United States after being radicalized at least, in part, by ISIS.

Last week, two cousins -- one of them a current member of the Illinois National Guard -- were arrested in Chicago for allegedly trying to launch ISIS-inspired attacks in the U.S. and overseas.

A week earlier, a U.S. Air Force veteran, 28-year-old Tairod Pugh of New Jersey, was indicted for his own ISIS-inspired plans. On his laptop, FBI agents allegedly discovered more than 180 jihadist propaganda videos.

In February, three New York City men were arrested on charges they allegedly conspired to join ISIS but also expressed willingness to carry out attacks on the terror group's behalf in the United States.

Over the past 18 months, more than 30 people in the United States have been charged with joining terrorist groups in Syria or trying to make it there.

""Secretary McDonald has apologized for the misstatement and noted that he never intended to misrepresent his military service,"" a White House official told ABC News. ""We take him at his word and expect that this will not impact the important work he's doing to promote the health and well-being of our nation's veterans.""

The exchange with the homeless man was part of a report about an effort to find military veterans among the homeless that aired on CBS News on Jan. 30.

""While I was in Los Angeles, engaging a homeless individual to determine his Veteran status, I asked the man where he had served in the military,"" McDonald said in a statement today. ""He responded that he had served in special forces. I incorrectly stated that I had been in special forces. That was inaccurate and I apologize to anyone that was offended by my misstatement.

""I have great respect for those who have served our nation in special forces,"" McDonald added. ""They, and all Veterans, deserve a Department of Veterans Affairs that provides them the care and benefits they have earned. I remain committed to continuing our progress to improve VA services and our ongoing effort to reform VA for the long-term.""

McDonald, former Procter and Gamble CEO, served with the Army's 82nd Airborne Division and completed jungle, arctic and desert warfare training, according to the Department of Veterans Affairs.

He earned the Ranger tab, the Expert Infantryman Badge and Senior Parachutist wings, the VA added, noting that McDonald, who retired as a captain, was awarded the Meritorious Service Medal after leaving the service."

Mueller's family received the letter in the spring of 2014 while the Arizona native was still in captivity.

It is unclear how the family received the handwritten note from their daughter, but she tells how ""just the thought of you all sends me into a fit of tears.""

In the emotional letter, she does not say anything negative about her captors, writing that she is ""completely unharmed + healthy (put on weight in fact); I have been treated w/ the utmost respect + kindness.""

Instead, she puts the brunt of her emotional turmoil on herself.

""If you could say I have 'suffered' at all throughout this whole experience it is only in knowing how much suffering I have put you all through,"" she wrote.

ISIS has reported that Mueller was killed as a result of a Jordanian airstrike, though that has not been verified by American or international intelligence forces. The Jordanian airstrikes came after the terror group released a highly-stylized video showing a captive Jordanian pilot being set on fire and burned to death.

Mueller was taken captive on Aug. 4, 2013 -- just days before her 25th birthday -- after leaving a Spanish Doctors Without Borders hospital in Aleppo, Syria, according to information provided by a family spokesperson.

According to the letter, she relied on memories of family camping trips and her faith to help her during her captivity, writing that ""by God + by your prayers I have felt tenderly cradled in freefall.""

""None of us could have known it would be this long but know I am also fighting from my side in the ways I am able + I have a lot of fight left inside of me. I am not breaking down + I will not give in no matter how long it takes,"" she wrote.

She repeated that her family should not be responsible for negotiating for her release, saying it ""should never have become your burden.""

""None of us could have known it would be this long but know I am also fighting from my side in the ways I am able + I have a lot of fight left inside of me. I am not breaking down + I will not give in no matter how long it takes,"" she wrote.

Below is a full transcript of the letter:

Everyone,

If you are receiving this letter it means I am still detained but my cell mates (starting from 11/2/2014) have been released. I have asked them to contact you + send you this letter. It’s hard to know what to say.

Please know that I am in a safe location, completely unharmed + healthy(put on weight in fact); I have been treated w/ the utmost respect + kindness. I wanted to write you all a well thought out letter (but I didn’t know if my cellmates would be leaving in the coming days or the coming months restricting my time but primarily) I could only but write the letter a paragraph at a time, just the thought of you all sends me into a fit of tears.

If you could say I have “suffered” at all throughout this whole experience it is only in knowing how much suffering I have put you all through; I will never ask you to forgive me as I do not deserve forgiveness. I remember mom always telling me that all in all in the end the only one you really have is God. I have come to a place in experience where, in every sense of the word, I have surrendered myself to our creator b/c literally there was no else….+ by God + by your prayers I have felt tenderly cradled in freefall.

I have been shown in darkness, light + have learned that even in prison, one can be free. I am grateful. I have come to see that there is good in every situation, sometimes we just have to look for it. I pray each each day that if nothing else, you have felt a certain closeness + surrender to God as well + have formed a bond of love + support amongst one another…

I miss you all as if it has been a decade of forced separation. I have had many a long hour to think, to think of all the things I will do w/ Lex, our first family camping trip, the first meeting @ the airport.I have had many hours to think how only in your absence have I finally @ 25 years old come to realize your place in my life.

The gift that is each one of you + the person I could + could not be if you were not a part of my life, my family, my support. I DO NOT want the negotiations for my release to be your duty, if there is any other option take it, even if it takes more time. This should never have become your burden. I have asked these women to support you; please seek their advice. If you have not done so already, [REDACTED] can contact [REDACTED] who may have a certain level of experience with these people.

None of us could have known it would be this long but know I am also fighting from my side in the ways I am able + I have a lot of fight left inside of me. I am not breaking down + I will not give in no matter how long it takes.

I wrote a song some months ago that says, “The part of me that pains the most also gets me out of bed, w/out your hope there would be nothing left…” aka -­ The thought of your pain is the source of my own, simultaneously the hope of our reunion is the source of my strength. Please be patient, give your pain to God. I know you would want me to remain strong. That is exactly what I am doing. Do not fear for me, continue to pray as will I + by God’s will we will be together soon.

All my everything,
Kayla"

The Royal Caribbean cruise ship that left on Thursday was scheduled to arrive back to Tampa, Florida, on Monday but it is only now making a slow trip back to port.

Most of the 2,160 guests on board the Brilliance of the Seas were Ohio State football fans on board as part of an annual cancer charity fundraiser, and the passengers included the team's coach, Urban Meyer.

Though they were stuck at sea, appeared to be making the best out of the situation.

Passenger Lanne Bennett told ABC News that the trip has ""been absolutely amazing.""

There was a two-and-a-half-hour, evening karaoke session on board the ship Monday, the day the trip originally was to end, a passenger said.

Food and water supplies were never an issue, the passenger added. However, the ship's captain reportedly told passengers that if it became one, the ship could just take a day trip to Miami. To make the situation more comfortable, the captain was able to pull the ship closer to shore for better cell phone service.

""We’re all Buckeyes, we’re all from Ohio,"" Bennett told ABC News. ""We’ve weathered worse things.""

A spokeswoman for Royal Caribbean told ABC News that there were 880 crew members on board as well as the passengers. The ship was still slated to arrive back in Tampa this evening and guests would be given the option of leaving as soon as they dock or staying on board the ship until Wednesday morning.

The football fans weren't the only cruise passengers affected. Royal Caribbean had to cancel a subsequent trip involving the ship that was scheduled to begin on Monday.

Passengers whose trip got cancelled were refunded and will receive a discount on their next booking, according to Royal Caribbean.

In December, when the parents and doctors of one of her students reached out to the public for help in finding a donor, Painter was one of the first to volunteer to be tested. She'd only been teaching at the school since last year.

Matthew Parker, a 6-year-old triplet, attend Painter's class with his two brothers at Hoffmann Lane Elementary School in New Braunfels, Texas.

His kidneys had been failing him since he was a newborn. He'd gotten a kidney donation in 2010 but about two years ago it failed. Since then, he missed school three days out of the week to travel to San Antonio for dialysis.

Doctors said Matthew had a 1 percent chance that a second donor would be found. More than 70 people volunteered to see whether they were a match, including Painter.

""When I went in to be tested, they thanked me for coming in but also kind of prepared me for the fact that it would most likely not be a match,"" she told ABC News today.

Then Painter and the Parkers got mind-blowing news.

""We were shocked to find out that we were a match,"" said Painter, the mother of two boys, ages 6 and 10.

""She's literally the perfect match for Matthew,"" the school's principal, Krista Moffatt, said in a statement, according to ABC affiliate KVUE-TV. ""This act personifies her character as someone willing to perform a selfless deed.""

Surgery is scheduled for mid-March, officials said. One of Painter's kidneys will be removed. If the surgery is successful, he could return to school full time in eight weeks.

Painter said she hoped to see Matthew every day at the school next year as a second-grader.

""Every time I watch [my sons] active and running around and playing and loud and doing all of these things that little boys should do ... I hope that Matthew is able to get this chance once he gets his kidney,"" she said. ""I am honored to be able to help him out this way."""

The announcement drew gasps from the audience, as well as applause, as Stewart fought back his emotions. He called his role with the show ""the honor of my professional life.""

Stewart, 52, began hosting ""The Daily Show"" in 1999, making fun of the news in a way that caught the imagination of a generation of younger viewers. His show mixes comedy correspondent stories with interviews of celebrities and newsmakers, with the goal of eliciting laughs but also making cogent points about politics, newsmakers and the media.

After Stewart made his announcement during the taping, the show teased the development on social media.

Tonight! For once, you wanna stay through the interview.

""Through his unique voice and vision, The Daily Show has become a cultural touchstone for millions of fans and an unparalleled platform for political comedy that will endure for years to come,"" Comedy Central said in a statement. ""Jon will remain at the held of The Daily Show until later this year.""

Stewart took a hiatus from hosting ""The Daily Show"" over the summer of 2013 to direct his first feature film, titled ""Rosewater,"" which came out this year.

From their fake news desk, ""The Daily Show"" and Stewart have won 19 Emmy awards as well as a Grammy.

Stewart began his career on the comedy club circuit and in the early '90s gained a wider audience through appearances on ""Late Night With David Letterman."" In 1993, he began a successful talk show on MTV.

Stewart told Bill O'Reilly in 2008 that ""The Daily Show"" had no intentional political agenda beyond ""schnicks and giggles."" And over the years he has skewered both Republican and Democratic figures with equal zeal.

U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen’s decision comes after a hearing in Brownsville, Texas, in January and puts on hold Obama’s order, which could protect millions of immigrants who are here illegally from being deported.

Hanen wrote in a memorandum accompanying his ruling that the lawsuit should go forward and that without a preliminary injunction the states will ""suffer irreparable harm in this case.""

""The genie would be impossible to put back into the bottle,"" he wrote, adding that he agreed with the plaintiffs' argument that legalizing the presence of millions of people is a ""virtually irreversible"" action.

The White House released a statement Tuesday criticizing the judge’s decision.

“The Supreme Court and Congress have made clear that the federal government can set priorities in enforcing our immigration laws—which is exactly what the President did when he announced commonsense policies to help fix our broken immigration system. Those policies are consistent with the laws passed by Congress and decisions of the Supreme Court, as well as five decades of precedent by presidents of both parties who have used their authority to set priorities in enforcing our immigration laws,” the statement reads.

“The Department of Justice, legal scholars, immigration experts, and the district court in Washington, D.C. have determined that the President’s actions are well within his legal authority. Top law enforcement officials, along with state and local leaders across the country, have emphasized that these policies will also benefit the economy and help keep communities safe. The district court’s decision wrongly prevents these lawful, commonsense policies from taking effect and the Department of Justice has indicated that it will appeal that decision.”

Cesar Vargas and Erika Andiola, co-directors of the Dream Action Coalition, a political and lobbying voice in immigration issues, also issued a statement saying they weren’t surprised by the judge’s decision.

“The injunction is clearly based more on politics than law, and is now part of an aggressive effort by the rightward fringe of the GOP to scare Dreamers and parents from applying,” the statement reads. “Nevertheless, we will not let this temporary obstacle stop us from holding forums, encouraging people to collect their paperwork and eventually apply; this injunction is only temporary after all.”

The first of Obama’s orders protecting young undocumented immigrants was set to start taking effect Wednesday.

Army National Guard Specialist Hasan Edmonds, 22, was arrested at Chicago Midway International Airport as he was trying to fly to Egypt and ultimately join ISIS in Syria or Iraq, according to authorities. His cousin, Jonas Edmonds, 29, was arrested at his home in Aurora, Illinois, authorities said.

It was all the culmination of an FBI undercover operation, and both men had been under FBI surveillance for months, charging documents say.

Hasan Edmonds first came onto the FBI’s radar in late 2014, and the FBI investigation began with an undercover agent sending him a ""friend request"" over Facebook, according to the charging documents. That agent and the 22-year-old, who joined the Illinois National Guard about three years ago, began exchanging messages online. At the same time, Hasan Edmonds had allegedly been watching ISIS propaganda videos online.

In one message to the undercover FBI agent, Hasan Edmonda allegedly wrote: ""I’d rather struggle and strive hard in the cause of Allah ... than sit back and live a 'comfortable' life. ... The [Islamic] State has been established and it is our duty to heed the call.""

He allegedly noted that while he is already in an army of non-believers, ""now I wish only to serve in the army of Allah alongside my true brothers.""

""Either we will make it to [the Islamic State] or bring the flames of war to the heart of this land,"" he wrote that day, according to charging documents.

In later conversations with the undercover agent, Hasan Edmonds allegedly said his cousin -- who first brought ISIS to his attention -- was willing to conduct an attack inside the United States. Jonas Edmonds was then approached by another undercover FBI agent, and in the following days the group discussed ways of getting to Syria or Iraq.

By Monday, the three had allegedly finalized a plan: Hasan Edmonds would leave the United States to join ISIS, and he would give his cousin his military uniform. Jonas Edmonds would then use AK-47s and grenades to attack the military installation where his cousin trained, according to charging documents.

Jonas Edmonds said he wanted a ""body count"" as high as 150, the charging documents say.

Hasan Edmonds was arrested yesterday at Chicago's Midway airport. The FBI now has his luggage.

This case comes a week after a former U.S. Air Force veteran was indicted by federal authorities for allegedly trying to join ISIS.

Tairod Nathan Webster Pugh, 47, who is from New Jersey but had been living overseas for years, was secretly arrested two months ago after being deported back to the United States.

On his laptop, FBI agents allegedly discovered more than 180 jihadist propaganda videos and noticed he had been conducting online searches for such phrases as ""borders controlled by Islamic state,"" ""kobani border crossing,"" and ""who controls kobani.""

Last month, three New York City men were arrested on charges they allegedly conspired to join ISIS but also expressed willingness to carry out attacks on the terror group's behalf in the United States. The men had planned to travel to the Middle East and had also pledged to launch attacks in this country, including one on President Obama or planting a bomb in Coney Island, Brooklyn, federal officials said.

Over the past 18 months, about 30 people have been charged with joining terrorist groups in Syria and Iraq or trying to do so.

Shelly and Jim Golay of Casper, Wyoming, met at church in 1984. They had a ""fairy tale romance"" and even went to Disneyland in California for their honeymoon, Shelly Golay told ABC News today.

Her husband was ""very much a family man,"" Golay, 52, said, adding that they have two children, now 27 and 25.

The family has owned Rocky Mountain Industrial Supply, an industrial and safety distribution company, since 2007.

""Jim was just an amazing man. Everybody that ever met him loved him. He was always just my rock. And the whole family's rock. And he just had this unwavering faith that was just inspiring. Always had a positive attitude,"" Golay added.

Jim was diagnosed with brain cancer on Easter 2012.

""Had a strength that was just contagious. He was tough as nails,"" Golay said. ""When he went through his chemo, he didn't look like a chemo patient, didn't act like a chemo patient.""

In February 2014, they learned the cancer was inoperable. Jim was given four months to live and he died in June 2014 at age 53.

""They usually give you 12 months to live and he lived 26 months,"" Golay said. ""That was just a blessing.""

This Valentine's Day, eight months after Jim's death, Golay says she received flowers with a card that read, ""Happy Valentine's Day Honey. Stay Strong! Yours Forever Love Jim.""

""My first thought was my kids gave it to me,"" Golay said.

But when she asked her son and daughter, they both denied sending the gift.

Golay spoke with a co-worker, who suggested the flowers may have been from Jim. When Golay looked on the back of the card, she found her husband's cellphone number. ""That was very emotional,"" she said. ""I knew it was him.""

""I went back to my son and said, 'You have to call the flower shop and confirm Dad sent these. I'm too emotional.' Sure enough, he had come in that last Valentine's Day and had said, 'Just send her flowers for the rest of her life.'""

Their daughter, Ashley Wisroth, was at the grocery store when she found out who the flowers were from, and ""just started bawling,"" she told ABC News today.

""I was so excited to know he had done something so sweet. It was just like my dad to do something like that. At the same time, it was bittersweet, because we knew in order for him to set something like that up, he must have known at one point he wasn't going to make it.""

Golay said the flowers ""means to me that his love never ends.""

""He set up such an amazing gift for me to receive that,"" Golay said. ""That act of love to me is just true love in its purest form."""

It's the first time since 1952 that the country has buried a monarch.

The remains of the former king--who died in 1485--were found in 2012 under a car parking garage, according to the BBC.

The procession began with a ceremony today at the University of Leicester, the BBC reports, where archaeologists, researchers and descendants of Richard III's family were in attendance.

The cortege is traveling throughout Leicestershire today and is expected to reach Leicester Cathedral later in the day, according to the BBC. The king will be reinterred at the cathedral on Thursday.

Queen Elizabeth reportedly wrote a greeting that will appear at Thursday's service, a spokesperson for the cathedral told the BBC, but the details of the message haven't been released.

The public will be able to view the coffin at the cathedral from Monday to Wednesday, the BBC reported.

According to the official website of the UK monarchy, Richard III ""usurped the throne from the young Edward V, who disappeared with his younger brother while under their ambitious uncle's supposed protection.

""Before becoming king, Richard had had a strong power base in the north, and his reliance on northerners during his reign was to increase resentment in the south. Richard concluded a truce with Scotland to reduce his commitments in the north. Nevertheless, resentment against Richard grew.

""On 7 August 1485, Henry Tudor (a direct descendant through his mother Margaret Beaufort, of John of Gaunt, one of Edward III's younger sons) landed at Milford Haven in Wales to claim the throne. On 22 August, in a two-hour battle at Bosworth, Henry's forces (assisted by Lord Stanley's private army of around 7,000 which was deliberately posted so that he could join the winning side) defeated Richard's larger army and Richard was killed.""

It's unclear how his remains wound up under the garage, but genetic testing through the maternal DNA of the departed king proved his identity conclusively, according to British press reports."
1FY9vp5,2015-03-22 00:00:00,Bar Co-owner Says Martese Johnson Was 'Cordial' the Night of His Arrest - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/US/bar-owner-martese-johnson-cordial-night-arrest/story?id=29818409,"The co-owner of the Charlottesville bar that Martese Johnson tried to enter before his bloody arrest said that the University of Virginia student was ""cordial and respectful"" and did not appear to be drunk.

Johnson, 20, was bloodied during an arrest near the campus early Wednesday morning, sparking protests on the campus over alleged police brutality as well as a state investigation of the incident. He was arrested outside a Charlottesville bar by state Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) agents who are charged with enforcing alcohol laws in Virginia.

Kevin Badke, the co-owner of Trinity Irish Pub, said in a statement last night that Johnson was refused entry to the pub moments before he was arrested and the bar does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion or national origin. Johnson, 20, was rejected because he provided the wrong zip code when presenting his ID, Badke said.

“Mr. Johnson, probably realizing the reason for the error, stated that he had moved. At this point, Mr. Badke and Mr. Johnson had a brief conversation because Mr. Badke is from the south side of Chicago, where Mr. Johnson indicated he was from. In Mr. Badke’s opinion, Mr. Johnson did not appear to be intoxicated in the least. Despite the conversation, which was cordial and respectful, Mr. Badke reiterated that he could not permit him to enter,"" according to Trinity’s statement.

In Virginia, there is no legal requirement that customers entering a restaurant where alcohol is served must be over the age of 21. So Johnson had every right to attempt to enter Trinity so long as he was using his lawful identification. Trinity’s decision to enact a 21 and over policy after 10 p.m., for busy evenings, does not make Johnson’s attempt to enter illegal.

“He handed Mr. Johnson his ID back and Mr. Johnson began walking in a north westerly direction up University Avenue. A few moments later, Mr. Badke heard a commotion, turned, and saw Mr. Johnson on the ground about 30 feet further up on University Avenue with ABC agents detaining him,” the statement continued.

In a press conference Thursday, Johnson said through his attorney Daniel Watkins in a statement that he was ""shocked that my face was slammed into the brick pavement three blocks from where I attend school.""

Alcoholic Beverage Control said Johnson was charged with public intoxication and obstruction of justice.

The arrest is currently under investigation by the Virginia State Police."

""I take full responsibility for the mistakes that led to my suspension for the 2014 season,"" Rodriguez said in the statement. ""I regret that my actions made the situation worse than it needed to be. To Major League Baseball, the Yankees, the Steinbrenner family, the Players Association and you, the fans, I can only say I'm sorry.

""I accept the fact that many of you will not believe my apology or anything that I say at this point. I understand why and that's on me. It was gracious of the Yankees to offer me the use of Yankee Stadium for this apology but I decided the next time I am in Yankee Stadium, I should be in pinstripes doing my job.""

The Yankees owe Rodriguez $61 million over the remaining three years on his contract. New York has shown no inclination to release the three-time MVP.

Rodriguez could be asked about his PED use at his locker during spring training, but it appears he will decline to go into details.

""I served the longest suspension in the history of the League for PED use,"" Rodriguez said. ""The Commissioner has said the matter is over. The Players Association has said the same. The Yankees have said the next step is to play baseball.

""I'm ready to put this chapter behind me and play some ball.

""This game has been my single biggest passion since I was a teenager. When I go to Spring training, I will do everything I can to be the best player and teammate possible, earn a spot on the Yankees and help us win.""

Rodriguez met with top Yankees officials on Feb. 10 and apologized to the team as he prepares to report to spring training ahead of the first full-squad workout on Feb. 26.

The Yankees and Rodriguez released a joint statement after their 90-minute meeting that day, saying that the slugger ""initiated the meeting and apologized to the organization for his actions over the past several years.""

Yankees owner Hal Steinbrenner and team executives told Rodriguez that they want him to clear the air with the media before spring training, hoping to avoid the distraction that his news conference would create in Tampa.

1FYljWh,2015-02-17 00:00:00,"ABC News Hero Kevin Delany Dies, Helped Rescue Dozens as Saigon Fell - ABC News",http://abcnews.go.com/US/abc-news-hero-kevin-delany-dies-helped-rescue/story?id=29018306,"The ABC News journalist who helped rescue Vietnamese employees of the network and their family members, more than 100 people, as Saigon fell in 1975 has died at the age of 87. Kevin Delany passed away Jan. 15 in Bethesda from complications of Alzheimer's disease, his family said.

His exploits in Vietnam on behalf of the employees of the ABC News bureau and their families were remembered as “heroic” by ABC News vice president Bob Murphy.

""He was always a gentleman and what he did to save our Saigon staff was heroic and amazing,"" Murphy said. ""It set a standard for professional responsibility and human care that we have tried to follow ever since.""

But Delany's wife, Joan Kennan, said that her late husband never sought the spotlight himself.

""He was a very modest person. He didn't brag really about things that he had done, that were part of what he considered the job of being a journalist,"" Kennan said. ""He felt strongly that if there was a story, you just went and got it. It was not the job of the journalist to have the glory reflected on him.""

Delany served as an ABC News bureau chief in Asia in the early and mid-1970s and was in Saigon in late April 1975 when the North Vietnamese were bearing down on the city.

“No one could predict what would happen after a North Vietnamese takeover, but everyone assumed that anyone who had worked with Americans would be dealt with harshly,” Delany wrote in an alumni publication for Williams College in 2006. “The decision was made that ABC wished to assist all Vietnamese who had worked so earnestly and in many cases at great risk during the war years.”

“These were people who worked long and hard for us as cameramen, as sound men, as drivers, taking a substantial risk on a regular basis. We didn’t want them to be a target,” Delany said in an interview on ABC News in 2000.

Originally, 58 people were to be rescued, but Delany wrote in the Williams publication that the number grew “as families ‘discovered’ sons and daughters they had overlooked.” Delany arranged with the U.S. Embassy to get the people out in groups on different days via CIA-run aircraft -- a dicey operation the whole way.

“Crammed into two large vans, we arrived at the main gate only to have a nasty looking Vietnamese MP [military police] officer ignore our pleading and document waving and order us away from the gate,” Delany wrote of one attempt. “We drove around the base to a back gate only to be waved off again. Time was running out to get to the CIA terminal, and we went back to the main gate for one last try. I asked the heads of households to give me all of their Vietnamese piasters [currency] – soon to become worthless.”

Delany gave the money to an ABC cameraman who was able to slip it to the guard at the main gate. With a fistful of cash, the guard let them through.

“’Thank god for corruption,’ I thought, ‘The system still works,’” he wrote.

Overall Delany said there were a “few close calls” but everyone made it out. Delany didn’t leave until the day before the city fell.

“When our turn came, we ran out to the helicopter, jumped on and lifted off and Saigon began to get further and further in the distance,” he said in 2000. “I could see a number of the Vietnamese on board choking back tears and crying and getting their last look at their city.”"

The 51-year-old astronaut has signed on to live in the International Space Station for a full year on Friday. The goal of the mission is to find out how the human body responds to a prolonged stay in space. No American astronaut has spent more than six months beyond Earth’s atmosphere, and the full extent of the physical and psychological strains of space exploration are still unknown.

“There are risks and I am willing to accept that for what we are going to learn from it,” Kelly told ABC’s David Kerley.

Scott Kelly’s twin brother, Mark, who is also an astronaut, will be remain on Earth as an experimental control to help measure the changes to Scott’s body while in space.

“We need to figure out how people are going to live in space for really long periods of time, especially if we want to send somebody to Mars [and]… build a base on the Moon,” Mark Kelly said.

It takes 18 months roundtrip to get to Mars, and the data from Kelly’s expedition will help NASA determine whether a human can survive that journey. Scott Kelly recognizes the risks of the unprecedented expedition, but says he’s focused on doing what it takes to advance space travel and exploration.

“That's one of the things that makes it exciting and something I am really happy to be a part of,” he said."

The shocking attack on the the Stamford Hill synagogue has led to six arrests today, on suspicion of public order offences and assault, police said.

Young worshippers had been celebrating the end of the sabbath at the Ahavas Torah synagogue and were forced to defend themselves with chairs. One young man was allegedly beaten outside the synagogue, before being chased inside.

A graphic video has emerged on Youtube capturing part of the incident, which London police are treating as ""an anti-Semitic incident"" as a result of the comment made by members of the group.

The London police said there was no evidence the attack was either planned or targeted, and said it appeared the attackers had walked to the synagogue from a house party nearby.

""There is no suggestion that this was a far-right or extremist attack but rather the completely unacceptable actions of a drunken group,"" the Metropolitan police said in a statement.

""We are investigating to establish the full circumstances of the incident and to identify anyone else involved in the disturbance who has not yet been arrested, Inspector Jonathan Waterfield said.
""We have also increased police patrols in the Stamford Hill area to provide reassurance to the community."""

VisitIthaca.com has decided to direct all people to its website to ""visit The Florida Keys this week.""

A pop-up photo of palm trees complete with a link to a Florida Keys tourism site reads:

""That's it. We surrender. Winter, you win. Key West anyone?

Due to this ridiculously stupid winter, Ithaca invites you to visit The Florida Keys this week. Please come back when things thaw out. Really, it's for the birds here now. (Still want to Visit Ithaca? Are you sure? Ok, click here.)

P.S. Send us a postcard.""

Visitors Bureau Director Bruce Stoff said, ""We just reached the breaking point this last weekend. The skiing is great now, the best Ithaca has had in years, but we don't blame people for dreaming of palm trees.""

When he contacted people at the Keys website to which the Ithaca site links, Stoff said, they were ""taken aback.""

""They didn't really take us seriously,"" he said.

But Stoff was quite serious and changed the Visit Ithaca site Sunday evening. And the idea to tell people to stay away from the destination has resulted in far more attention than the destination's used to getting in the winter months.

Temperatures in Ithaca this week will dip into the single digits. The Keys? Today's high is 76.

""Come see us when we thaw out,"" Stoff said."

Jodi Routh was the second defense witness called to the stand in Texas today and gave the most thorough portrait to date of her son’s early life. She said he got ""fair grades"" as a youngster and played on his high school football team.

""His dad took him hunting and taught him about firearms,"" she said, which is something he and famed sniper Chris Kyle, whom Routh is accused of killing in 2013, had in common.

The defense launched into its case today by showing the host of long rifles found at the crime scene, a shooting range, including Kyle's personalized gun that had ""American Sniper"" written on the handle.

Jodi Routh noted that her son changed after he returned from the Marines after having served in Iraq and Haiti. During the humanitarian mission in Haiti, she said he ""helped clean up bodies from beaches.""

She said he was ""not happy-go-lucky"" when he came back. ""Sometimes he wasn't able to express how he was feeling,"" she said.

Jodi Routh said her son admitted himself to a veterans' hospital for three days in 2011 after trying to kill himself with a gun.

She was the one who made the connection with Kyle, and when she said her son had been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, the famed sniper allegedly said he would love to help because he had suffered from PTSD as well.

Defense calls Routh's mother to stand. She says mental health issues surfaced after military service #snipertrial pic.twitter.com/3Qr29NtcBL

Chris Kyle gave Jodi a hug and said he would do everything in his power to help her son. #heartbreaking

She testified that her daughter was the one to tell her that her son had allegedly killed the two men, but she made a phone call to see whether it was a mistake.

""I had Chris Kyle's number in my phone and dialed that number praying to God he would answer,"" Jodi Routh said in court today.

The prosecution rested its case early this afternoon against Routh after just five days.

This morning’s session included footage of Routh inside the back of the police car being shown in a Texas court, where he was seen acting restless and talking about his mental state.

Lancaster police Officer Flavio Salazar testified today about how he drove Routh after he was arrested in the slayings of Chris Kyle and Kyle's friend Chad Littlefield on Feb. 2, 2013.

Routh appeared panicked and the officer told him to ""take a deep breath,"" as seen in the video shown today in the Erath County courthouse.

At one point, Salazar tries to calm him by saying, ""I was in Iraq too, man.""

The video shows Routh moving around in the back seat and at times lying down, prompting Salazar to ask whether he was all right.

""I've been so paranoid and schizophrenic all day,” Routh replies. “I don't know if I'm insane or what's going on in the world right now.”

Routh faces life in prison if he is found guilty of murder charges. He has entered a not guilty plea and his defense team will be arguing that he was insane at the time of the shooting."

Lippert is being treated for wounds to his face and subsequent wounds to his arm that he suffered when trying to fight off the attacker this morning.

Officials say the guard assigned to Lippert was an out-of-uniform Korean National Police officer and that it's customary in Seoul for police officers not to carry guns.

After the attack, Lippert was seen bleeding while escorted out of the building by attendees of the event.

The attacker, who is known to police as potential threat, was subdued in the street outside of the building shortly after.

All personal security for any given ambassador is decided upon by the Regional Security Officer and the ambassador himself.

Seoul is generally considered a low-threat post and one official described Lippert's security detail on Thursday as ""routine.""

Security for different posts varies greatly. The ambassador in a country like Yemen, for instance, could have multiple diplomatic security agents supplemented by a small military force, such as Marine guards.

The State Department announced that Lippert is currently recovering in a local hospital and that he says he is in ""great spirits."""

Beatrice Yardolo, 58, spent 16 days in a Chinese Ebola treatment unit, but she returned home today, singing and dancing while her husband looked on and cried. He told ABC News he was so happy that it was overwhelming.

""Words are inadequate to even express how I feel,"" Steve Yardolo, 61, told ABC News, stopping at times to stare at his wife in awe. ""If people could see the inner part of a mind, of an inner being, they would have seen the happiness in me.""

She said the doctors at the Chinese Ebola treatment unit in Monrovia saved her life.

""My walking from here to go to the [Ebola treatment unit] center, it wasn't easy,"" Yardolo told ABC News. ""[My] children crying behind me, 'Don't go! don't go.' I said, ‘If I don't go, it will be bad again.'""

Since the outbreak began in March, the World Health Organization has reported 23,934 Ebola cases and 9792 Ebola deaths in the West African countries where the virus is prominent: Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. In Liberia, WHO reported 9,249 cumulative cases and 4,117 deaths.

According to WHO, 384 new Ebola cases have been reported in the past 21 days, six of which were in Liberia. And one of them was Yardolo. And if there are no new cases for 42 days, twice the length of the virus's incubation period, Liberia can be declared Ebola-free.

Liberia has 19 Ebola treatment units, and none of them has any confirmed Ebola patients now, said Tolbert Nyenswah, Liberia's assistant minister of public health. The country has gone 13 days so far without any new confirmed cases, he said.

""This is significant progress, and this is why we are celebrating, but Ebola is not out yet,"" Nyenswah said. ""We are not out of the woods yet.

Colorado voters passed Amendment 64 legalizing recreational marijuana in November 2012. Retail stores began selling weed January 1, 2014, but pot is still considered illegal by the federal government.

""Amendment 64 is preempted by federal law and therefore violates the Supremacy Clause (Article VI) of the United States Constitution,” according to the lawsuit, filed today in federal court.

The plaintiffs—six Colorado sheriffs, four Nebraska sheriffs along with two county attorneys from Nebraska and Kansas— want the relevant sections of the Colorado constitution declared “invalid, null, and void.”

Speaking at the National Press Club in Washington D.C. today, Sheriff Mark Overman of Scott’s Bluff County, Nebraska says Colorado’s marijuana is a burden on taxpayers in his jurisdiction.

“Colorado’s legalization of marijuana has completely changed the landscape involving the marijuana that we encounter,” he said. ""Because of Amendment 64, our jails are full, our court dockets are full. There are increased costs for overtime, for incarceration.”

Overman also claims his deputies are busting more kids for pot.

“We are seeing a marked increase in the numbers of children as young as 13 that we are finding in possession of marijuana. We don’t want what Colorado has,"" he said.

Larimer County Colorado Sheriff Justin Smith also said legalized marijuana in his state has created a “constitutional showdown” for law enforcement.

“In Colorado every elected official, sheriffs included, are required under the state constitution to take an oath of office,” Smith said. “And that oath of office requires that they swear to defend the Constitution of the United States and the state of Colorado. Amendment 64 puts a conflict in those two parts of the oath of office.”

The Justice Department has said it will not take legal action against states that have approved recreational marijuana use.

Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper is named as the defendant in the lawsuit filed today.

Hickenlooper has not been formally served with the lawsuit, said his spokeswoman Kathy Green.

However, Green told ABC News, “We will continue to defend the will of the voters while prioritizing public safety.”

Marijuana advocates say the lawsuit is frivolous.

""These guys need to get over it,” said Mason Tvert with the Marijuana Policy Project.

""These law enforcement officers are trying to force marijuana cultivation and sales back into the underground market. Colorado adopted these laws in order to start controlling marijuana, and it's working,” Tvert told ABC News.

Recreational marijuana is now legal in Alaska, Colorado, Washington state and Washington, D.C."

The escaped prisoner, Wossen Assaye, was identified by a bus passenger who recognized him on the bus and called police, a law enforcement source told ABC News.

The suspect was arrested in Washington, D.C., by Metropolitan Police Department without incident at 25th and Pennsylvania Avenue SE, law enforcement sources added.

Assaye earlier prompted a lockdown at Inova Fairfax Hospital, in Falls Church, Virginia, less than 10 miles southwest of Washington, D.C., authorities said.

Assaye had been taken to the hospital for injuries sustained during a suicide attempt last Friday, officials said. For the first 24 hours of his hospital treatment, he was watched by Alexandria County sheriff’s deputies, and after that, responsibility for security went to security contractor Allied Protective Services.

At 3 a.m. this morning, Assaye overpowered a female security guard at the hospital and took her gun, Fairfax County Police Chief Edwin Roessler said today after Assaye was captured.

Next, Assaye confronted a male security officer, according to Bobby Mathieson of the U.S. Marshals Service. Mathieson said the male officer fired a shot but no one was hit -- though Roessler said it was unknown who fired the shot.

Assaye then escaped through a hospital stairwell, officials said. Authorities say they don't know what restraints were on him. He was wearing a hospital gown and no shoes at the time.

Authorities said they did not know if the escape was pre-planned.

Assaye fled to a residential neighborhood and broke into the trunk of a 2002 silver Toyota Camry, authorities said. When the owner of the car started to drive to work, Assaye kicked his way out of the trunk and carjacked the vehicle, police said.

The driver was slightly injured during the carjacking, police said.

Around 10:30 a.m., the Camry was found abandoned. Assaye then carjacked another car and fled, police said.

The second car, a 2008 Hyundai Elantra, has also been located, police said after Assaye's capture.

Police said a weapon has been recovered.

Suspect abandoned the first stolen vehicle and has stolen a second one. We are now looking for a dark gray Hyundai Elantra w/VA: XTU-5024

A heavy police presence was reported near the hospital, and police vehicles were seen blocking the hospital’s entrances during the search for the prisoner. Hospital employees were being sent to a nearby high school, and a shuttle bus was carrying the employees to work during the lockdown, police said.

Assaye made his initial appearance in a federal courtroom in Alexandria, Virginia, this afternoon. He was charged with one count of escape from custody in addition to the charge he is already facing for armed robbery.

Assaye appeared ""heavily shackled"" and escorted by four deputy U.S. marshals, a law enforcement source said.

His next appearance will be Friday afternoon.

According to a court complaint, Assaye was accused in a string of bank robberies in eastern Virginia between October 2013 and March 20, 2015. In each situation, authorities say, the perpetrator entered the bank -- often with a cell phone to his ear -- either displayed a handgun or demand note, and verbally demanded money.

Assaye had a criminal history, with convictions for multiple burglary and robbery offenses in 1998 and 1999, and served time in prison between 2000 and May 2013, according to the complaint.

Though clips of half-naked residents plunging into the snow have social media users amused, Boston's mayor isn't laughing.

""This isn't Loon Mountain,"" Mayor Martin Walsh said in a news conference on Monday, referring to a New Hampshire ski resort. ""This is the city of Boston, where we're trying to remove snow off of the street, and it becomes very dangerous.""

""The last thing we want to do is respond to an emergency call where somebody jumped out of the window because they thought it was a funny thing to do,"" he added.

The latest blizzard this past Sunday has officially made this February the snowiest month the city has seen in its entire history. It's also left Boston struggling to remove over seven feet of snow that has accumulated over the past three weeks.

But some folks are not only making use of the seven feet to do daredevil jumps, but also to go swimming.

""These four storms we've had in a row are doing a tremendous wear and tear on our streets,"" said Walsh.

The snow seems to be driving the entire city crazy -- and some to the point of jumping off of roofs three stories high and into snowbanks.

“I’m asking people to stop this nonsense right now. These are adults jumping out windows,"" said Walsh."

Delta Flight 1086, an MD-88 arriving from Atlanta, skidded off Runway 13 around 11:05 a.m., according to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.

The Port Authority confirmed that all 127 passengers and five crew members, ""were safely taken off plane.""

At least 28 passengers had non-life threatening injuries, of those injured five people were transported to hospitals, according to the Fire Department of New York.

The runway where the plane landed had been plowed just minutes before and two other pilots reported ""good braking action"" as they landed, according to Port Authority Executive Director Pat Foye.

Once the plane landed, it veered sharply left about 4,500 to 5,000 feet down the 7,000-foot runway, skidding off to the side and nearly ending up in the water, according to Foye.

An Instagram video shot shortly after the crash showed a man at the scene leaving in a stretcher.

LaGuardia's runways were closed for most of the day, but one runway reopened at 2 p.m., according to Foye.

Officials said they were checking for a fuel leak.

The National Transportation Safety Board announced it would send an investigator to secure the flight data recorders and document the damage.

Images of the plane taken by eyewitnesses showed that it apparently crashed through a fence after skidding off the runway.

""Customers deplaned via aircraft slides and have moved to the terminal on buses,"" Delta Airlines said in a statement. ""Our priority is ensuring our customers and crew members are safe. Delta will work with all authorities and stakeholders to look into what happened in this incident.""

Passengers on the plane included New York Giants tight end Larry Donnell, who said he was ""safe and sound"" after the crash.

""I feel fine physically and hopefully all the other passengers did not have any significant injuries,"" read a portion of Donnell's statement. ""We were all shocked and alarmed when the plane started to skid, but most importantly, as far as I know, all of the passengers and flight crew were able to exit the plane safely.""

An incredible photo was captured by passenger Jared Falleci from inside the plane just after it came to a stop. Falleci told ABC News he had no idea if the plane would stay out of the water as they skidded off the runway.

""I was holding on to the seat in front of me and I was praying,"" he told ABC News. ""It literally stopped a matter of feet, as you can see from the photos, from the water itself."""

Clancy, who spent 27 years as an agent and later led the Secret Service presidential protection division, is personally well-liked and trusted by the Obama family, sources say.

He retired from the Secret Service in 2011 to take a post as a corporate security director at Comcast, but returned in October 2014 at Obama’s request after the abrupt resignation of director Julia Pierson.

""He has delivered the leadership many of us expected him to demonstrate,"" said White House spokesman Josh Earnest, who repeatedly characterized Clancy as ""credible."" ""Certainly his solid performance over the past several months certainly served him well.""

By selecting Clancy as the permanent agency head, Obama is bucking the recommendation of an independent review panel that had called for outside blood to lead the Secret Service, saying it suffered from an insulated management culture and lack of aggressive leadership.

The pick is also widely seen as an attempt to shore up morale in the agency's rank and file. Clancy is well respected among agents and officers and has worked to repair the damage of a difficult year.

“Joe Clancy has taken strong action over the past several months to begin righting the ship at the Secret Service, he has been extremely responsive to Congress,"" said Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., the ranking member on the House Oversight Committee, which oversees the U.S. Secret Service.

The Republican chairman of the committee, Rep. Jason Chaffetz of Utah, offered skepticism of Obama's selection, saying Clancy lacks a ""fresh perspective.""

""It is disappointing the President ignored the recommendation from the independent panel,"" Chaffetz said. ""That said, I appreciate how available Acting Director Clancy has made himself over the past few months."""

Beatrice Yardolo, 58, spent 16 days in a Chinese Ebola treatment unit, but she returned home today, singing and dancing while her husband looked on and cried. He told ABC News he was so happy that it was overwhelming.

""Words are inadequate to even express how I feel,"" Steve Yardolo, 61, told ABC News, stopping at times to stare at his wife in awe. ""If people could see the inner part of a mind, of an inner being, they would have seen the happiness in me.""

She said the doctors at the Chinese Ebola treatment unit in Monrovia saved her life.

""My walking from here to go to the [Ebola treatment unit] center, it wasn't easy,"" Yardolo told ABC News. ""[My] children crying behind me, 'Don't go! don't go.' I said, ‘If I don't go, it will be bad again.'""

Since the outbreak began in March, the World Health Organization has reported 23,934 Ebola cases and 9792 Ebola deaths in the West African countries where the virus is prominent: Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. In Liberia, WHO reported 9,249 cumulative cases and 4,117 deaths.

According to WHO, 384 new Ebola cases have been reported in the past 21 days, six of which were in Liberia. And one of them was Yardolo. And if there are no new cases for 42 days, twice the length of the virus's incubation period, Liberia can be declared Ebola-free.

Liberia has 19 Ebola treatment units, and none of them has any confirmed Ebola patients now, said Tolbert Nyenswah, Liberia's assistant minister of public health. The country has gone 13 days so far without any new confirmed cases, he said.

""This is significant progress, and this is why we are celebrating, but Ebola is not out yet,"" Nyenswah said. ""We are not out of the woods yet. We must continue all of the measures, and I said it is now up to the Liberian people to maintain the vigilance. And we sustain ourselves to zero and look at our borders to protect our people from the Ebola crisis.""

Yardolo, who has four living children, left the ward surrounded by doctors, nurses and her family that isn't under quarantine. Holding bright-red flowers as she stood before a crowd of onlookers, she thanked God and the Chinese treatment unit.

Trending worldwide, the social media campaign #WearYellowForSeth grabbed the attention of Seth fans from all over the globe.

Today, Seth embarks on the first step towards having the bone marrow transplant that could potentially save his life.

""He's doing generally okay,"" mom Leanne Lane told ABC News. ""He’s having an operation today to have his gallbladder out so so he can have his chemotherapy. He's in there right now.

""This is new for us. He's never had any operations on his organs before. He gets upset. He just says 'mummy and daddy' over and over again, but we’ll be outside waiting until hes awake.""

Despite her little boy having to go through surgery today, Lane says that Seth was overjoyed about the amount of people who wore yellow for him on Friday.

""Friday was amazing,"" she says. ""The hospital did a lot there, even the local firemen came to see him and put a ladder up to his window. He [Seth] was shell-shocked.

""It was so busy, we couldn’t even keep up. Obviously there was Ashton Kutcher and 'Paw Patrol.' They did all pups in yellow and sent him a voice message. Seth thought it was brilliant.

""On Saturday morning he said 'is everyone going to wear yellow again today?'""

Celebrities like Joe Jonas and Fifth Harmony's AllyBrooke joined Kutcher in wearing yellow. Television crews, retail stores, and even the cast of ""Sesame Street,"" tweeted in support of Seth.

Seth's gall bladder surgery was slightly delayed because of a chest infection.

Lane told ABC News that Seth has come out of surgery and he is on the road to recovery.

If all goes well, Seth's doctors will perform the bone marrow transplant in three to four weeks."
1G3SveB,2015-03-06 00:00:00,Hillary Clinton Was in Violation of State Dept. Policy for Nearly 6 Years - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/hillary-clinton-violation-state-dept-policy-years/story?id=29424270,"Hillary Clinton was in violation of State Department rules governing the use of non-governmental email accounts during her entire tenure as secretary of state and for nearly two years after she left the job, ABC News has learned.

A senior State Department official tells ABC News that under rules in place while Clinton was secretary of state, employees could only use private email accounts for official business if they turned those emails over to be entered into government computers. They were also forbidden from including sensitive but unclassified information on private email, except under some very narrow exceptions.

This policy is still in place, according to the Department. Until any private emails are entered into government computers, the official says, an employee is in violation of the rules.

Clinton used a private email account for her entire tenure as secretary -- and did not even have a government-issued email. She only turned over some 55,000 pages of emails to be entered into government computer systems late last year, nearly two years after she stepped down from the State Department.

It is also likely that some of Mrs. Clinton's emails contained information ""sensitive but unclassified"" as defined by the federal government, a senior State Department official acknowledged, in potential violation of the 2005 department regulation as codified in the Foreign Affairs Manual (FAM).

""Reports claiming that by using personal email [Clinton] is automatically out of step of that FAM are inaccurate,"" the official told ABC News in a statement. ""We are not going to prejudge the outcome of the review of Secretary Clinton's 55000 pages of emails.""

A spokesman for Clinton did not respond to ABC News' repeated requests for comment.

If Clinton has now turned over all emails related to official business, she would be in compliance with State Department rules, an official said. But there is no way to independently verify that she has done that.

Clinton’s spokesman said earlier this week that she has turned over about 90 percent of the emails she wrote as secretary of state, withholding only those that were strictly personal and not covered by the policy.

State Department email rules became an issue while Clinton was secretary of state.

One of Clinton’s ambassadors was criticized by the department’s inspector general in a 2012 report for using private email.

“It is the department’s general policy that normal day-to-day operations be conducted on an authorized information system, which has the proper level of security controls,” the Office of Inspector General wrote in the 2012 report, referencing the Foreign Affairs Manual provision dating to 2005.

The IG report warned that the use of non-governmental email accounts “increases the risk” of security breaches and the “loss of official public records as these systems do not have approved record preservation or backup functions.”

Clinton is believed to have established her own private email network based out of her Chappaqua, New York, home, where aides say she has personally preserved all messages before turning them over."

Days earlier, he had a fever and a cough.

""I felt helpless,"" Teresa Howe told ABC News' ""Nightline"" in December. ""He was lying in bed and he literally was screaming, 'Help me, Mom,' and I'm just bawling.""

Allen was among the small fraction of children with the respiratory illness enterovirus 68 to develop sudden unexplained paralysis after the initial severe flu-like symptoms. Allen and the others are reportedly recovering, but Dr. Charles Chiu, who set out with a team of researchers to figure out why the paralysis set in to begin with, said none of the 25 children he studied have fully recovered from their paralysis or muscle weakness since last summer.

Federal and state health officials have confirmed 1,153 enterovirus 68 cases in 49 states and Washington, D.C., from August through January. Fourteen patients died, and several clusters developed polio-like paralysis and muscle weakness. Chiu and his colleagues at the University of San Francisco set out to examine the link and determine why some children developed this side effect but not others.

They know that the paralysis and weakness is brought on by acute flaccid myelitis, or inflammation of the nerve cells, but it's tough to say how it's connected to the virus, experts say.

Chiu and his team at the University of California San Francisco and the University of Colorado published their study this week in the medical journal The Lancet. They found that of two siblings with identical strains of enterovirus 68, only one developed paralysis, leading Chiu to suspect that the virus alone may not be at fault for the paralysis. It could be an abnormal immune system response.

""This suggests that it's not only the virus, but also patients' individual biology that determines what disease they may present with,"" Chiu noted in a statement accompanying the study's publication.

The researchers also noticed that they didn't find traces of the virus in the cerebrospinal fluid surrounding the inflamed nerve cells, leading them to believe the virus wasn't directly attacking them. Chiu said it's crucial to continue searching for answers.

""Given that none of the children have fully recovered, we urgently need to continue investigating this new strain of EV-D68 [enterovirus 69] and its potential to cause acute flaccid myelitis.""

The peak enterovirus season has been over for some time, but Dr. Kathryn Miller, assistant professor of pediatrics at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee, said it could come back next year.

As a mother of four, she said she thinks it's important to remember that cases will go away like normal colds. Parents should remind their children to wash their hands thoroughly, and if a child's cold seems more severe than usual, parents should call their family doctor."

No messes. No allergies. No effort. Just pure, simple solidarity. Dahl’s Pet Rock was a key innovation of the 1970s, tongue-in-cheek humor for a post-Watergate world, a pop culture fad that made its creator lots of money -- and continued to draw bemused attention in the decades that followed.

Dahl, whose death was announced Tuesday at age 78, reportedly stumbled onto his Pet Rock idea while at a bar talking with friends.

Dahl quickly got to work, developing the packaging. The smooth stones rested on a bed of excelsior inside a cardboard box -- featuring air holes for breathing purposes, naturally -- and included a tongue-in-cheek instruction pamphlet for ""care and training.""

Lineage was highlighted, too, assuring the owner that there is “nothing common” about the rocks. No, these Pet Rocks came from a long line of famous rocks, the type of rocks found in pyramids and great walls.

The instructions featured obedience commands such as “come,” “stay,” “roll over” and “play dead” (“play dead” was one of the Pet Rock’s specialties).

Dahl introduced his Pet Rock in August 1975 in the San Francisco area, and the fad exploded, with more than one million of them sold in the ensuing months. “Tonight Show” appearances, newspaper clippings and even a song -- “I’m in Love With My Pet Rock,” by Al Bolt -- followed.

Despite his success, Dahl remained grounded.

“I packaged a sense of humor for a very bored public,” Dahl admitted in an interview with the Oakland Tribune.

The fad faded as the calendar switched to 1976, eventually relegated to a sweet, saccharine sentimentality with the likes of lava lamps, pogs and hula hoops. But decades later, Dahl’s creation continues to resonate. The Pet Rock was commemorated in a scene from the 1999 Mike Judge comedy, “Office Space.”

“You know, there are people in this world who don’t have to put up with all this s---, like that guy that invented the Pet Rock?” Tom Smykowski (Richard Riehle) says to his downtrodden co-workers. “You see, that’s what you have to do. You have to use your mind and come up with some really great idea like that. You could make millions. Never have to work again.”

“You think the Pet Rock was a really great idea?” Michael Bolton (David Herman) asks.

“Sure it was. The guy made $1 million.”

As the fad fizzled, Dahl estimated that he had sold 1.5 million Pet Rocks for $3.95 each – not a bad haul for devising a preposterous but pleasant pet.

""This approach reflects the university's longstanding commitment to wide access to educational opportunities,"" Michael Malone, vice chancellor for research and engagement, said in a statement today. ""It is now clear, after further consultation and deliberation, that we can adopt a less restrictive policy.""

The reversal comes just days after the school announced the ban to comply with a 2012 federal law -- part of sanctions against Iran to prevent it from acquiring nuclear weapons. The 2012 law denies visas for Iranian students in the U.S. if they want to work in the energy sector, nuclear science, nuclear engineering or related field in Iran.

Jamal Abdi, policy director of the National Iranian American Council, said his group was surprised by how many programs and students the ban would have affected at UMass Amherst.

""The scope is definitely surprising,"" Abdi said in an interview with ABC News before the ban was overturned. ""This is the problem with a university attempting to implement a law that the State Department is in charge of.""

Abdi later said his group members ""welcome UMass's reversal. We think they've done the right thing.""

Shirin Hakim, the former leader of the Persian Students Association at UMass Amherst, said she was overjoyed that the ban had been overturned and that she felt it was the result of a ""misunderstanding"" on the part of the school administration.

""We always felt welcomed and we're very pleased with the results,"" said Hakim, adding that she thought ""the administration is aware that they mistakenly released a policy that did not align with the support on campus.""

Amir Masoumi, a former graduate student who helped form the Iranian Graduate Student Association at UMass Amherst, said students he talked to thought the ban was ""discriminatory interpretation of the law.""

He said he was still concerned that news of the ban, despite the quick reversal, would deter prospective Iranian applicants. ""We hope that this ban and removal of this ban isn't going to affect those applicants,"" he said.

Abdi said the council knew of only one other school, Virginia Commonwealth University, with a similar ban, but that it was not as expansive as the UMass Amherst ban.

The State Department clarified in a statement that student visas would continue to be decided on a case-by-case basis and ""reviewed individually in accordance with the requirements of the U.S. Immigration and Nationality Act, and other relevant laws.""

""U.S. law does not prohibit qualified Iranian nationals coming to the United States for education in science and engineering,"" a State Department official said in a statement to ABC News.

""This approach reflects the university's longstanding commitment to wide access to educational opportunities,"" Michael Malone, vice chancellor for research and engagement, said in a statement today. ""It is now clear, after further consultation and deliberation, that we can adopt a less restrictive policy.""

The reversal comes just days after the school announced the ban to comply with a 2012 federal law -- part of sanctions against Iran to prevent it from acquiring nuclear weapons. The 2012 law denies visas for Iranian students in the U.S. if they want to work in the energy sector, nuclear science, nuclear engineering or related field in Iran.

Jamal Abdi, policy director of the National Iranian American Council, said his group was surprised by how many programs and students the ban would have affected at UMass Amherst.

""The scope is definitely surprising,"" Abdi said in an interview with ABC News before the ban was overturned. ""This is the problem with a university attempting to implement a law that the State Department is in charge of.""

Abdi later said his group members ""welcome UMass's reversal. We think they've done the right thing.""

Shirin Hakim, the former leader of the Persian Students Association at UMass Amherst, said she was overjoyed that the ban had been overturned and that she felt it was the result of a ""misunderstanding"" on the part of the school administration.

""We always felt welcomed and we're very pleased with the results,"" said Hakim, adding that she thought ""the administration is aware that they mistakenly released a policy that did not align with the support on campus.""

Amir Masoumi, a former graduate student who helped form the Iranian Graduate Student Association at UMass Amherst, said students he talked to thought the ban was ""discriminatory interpretation of the law.""

He said he was still concerned that news of the ban, despite the quick reversal, would deter prospective Iranian applicants. ""We hope that this ban and removal of this ban isn't going to affect those applicants,"" he said.

Abdi said the council knew of only one other school, Virginia Commonwealth University, with a similar ban, but that it was not as expansive as the UMass Amherst ban.

The State Department clarified in a statement that student visas would continue to be decided on a case-by-case basis and ""reviewed individually in accordance with the requirements of the U.S. Immigration and Nationality Act, and other relevant laws.""

""U.S. law does not prohibit qualified Iranian nationals coming to the United States for education in science and engineering,"" a State Department official said in a statement to ABC News.

The department noted there has been no recent change in U.S. policy or guidance regarding Iranian student visas."
1G5GTLV,2015-04-02 00:00:00,Iran Nuclear Talks Continue Past Deadline With No Deal in Sight - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/International/iran-nuclear-talks-continue-past-deadline-deal-sight/story?id=30054523,"More than 24 hours after the deadline expired, negotiators in Lausanne, Switzerland, have yet to produce any sort of agreement on how to dismantle Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for economic sanctions relief.

According to State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf, the negotiations will resume following an all-night negotiation session.

Negotiations ongoing at #IranTalks. @JohnKerry mtg with @JZarif; experts from all delegations in discussions. Lot of activity for late hour.

Earlier, Harf issued a brief statement indicating that Secretary of State John Kerry would remain overnight and continue the talks into Thursday. “We continue to make progress but have not reached a political understanding,” Harf said. “Therefore, Secretary Kerry will remain in Lausanne until at least Thursday morning to continue the negotiations.”

Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif emerged briefly from the marathon meetings, seeming agitated with the US approach. ""Our friends need to decide whether they want to be with Iran based on respect or whether they want to continue based on pressure,"" Zarif said.

Meanwhile, critics of the deal are starting to make their voices heard. House Speaker John Boehner made a surprise visit to Israel, where he met with President Benjamin Netanyahu. At a press conference Netanyahu said “the concessions offered to Iran in Lausanne would ensure a bad deal that would endanger Israel, the Middle East and the peace of the world.”

Back in the U.S., Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Arkansas, author of the now infamous letter to the Ayatollah, is criticizing the White House for letting the deadline slide. “The fact that the president is wanting to go back on his own words just a few week ago and extend past the March 31st deadline, sends a signal of weakness to the Iranians,” Cotton told Fox News."
1G5IOzS,2015-04-01 00:00:00,US Senator Robert Menendez 'Outraged' By Indictment on Corruption Charges - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-senator-robert-menendez-indicted-corruption-charges/story?id=30046251,"Sen. Bob Menendez said he's ""outraged"" by federal corruption charges he's facing stemming from his interactions with a Florida eye doctor.

""For nearly three years, I’ve lived under a Justice Department cloud, and today, I’m outraged that this cloud has not been lifted,"" Menendez said at a news conference in Newark, New Jersey, Wednesday night. ""I am confident at the end of the day I will be vindicated.""

""This is not how my career is going to end,"" Menendez said. ""I'm angry and ready to fight because today contradicts my public service career and my entire life.""

In a short news conference, Menendez maintained his innocence, saying his actions adhered to the law.

“Prosecutors don’t know the difference between friendship and corruption,"" Menendez added.

Menendez, D-New Jersey, along with Dr. Salomon Melgen, is charged with one count of conspiracy, one count of violating the travel act, eight counts of bribery and three counts of honest services fraud.

Menendez was also charged with one count of making false statements.

The Department of Justice filed the charges in the District of New Jersey.

The charges center on Menendez’s relationship with Melgen, who is a close Menendez ally and donor to the New Jersey senator, in connection with a bribery scheme in which the senator allegedly accepted gifts from Melgen in exchange for using the power of his Senate office to benefit the doctor's financial and personal interests.

The indictment includes allegations Menendez accepted close to $1 million worth of gifts and campaign contributions from Melgen between 2006 and 2013 in exchange for advocating on the behalf of the doctor, saying the senator ""used the prestige, authority and influence of his status as a United States Senator to promote Melgen’s personal and business interests.”

Some of the gifts cited in the indictment include flights on Melgen’s private jet, vacations to the Dominican Republic, and $40,000 in contributions to his legal defense fund. Melgen also donated over $750,000 in campaign contributions. Menendez did not report the gifts Melgen provided on any financial disclosure forms.

The indictment also alleges the New Jersey senator used his position and his staff to advocate for Melgen’s interests, including stepping in in a legal dispute involving approximately $8.9 million of Medicare overbilling by Melgen and supporting visa applications for Melgen’s girlfriends.

Last month, the New Jersey Democrat denied any wrongdoing as the Department of Justice weighed issuing criminal charges against him.

“Let me be very clear, very clear. I have always conducted myself appropriately and in accordance with the law,” Menendez said.

Menendez is the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and has been at the forefront of many of the Senate’s recent foreign policy fights. Menendez, who is of Cuban descent, is a fierce opponent of President Obama’s decision to normalize relations with Cuba. The New Jersey senator is also leading efforts to impose new sanctions on Iran if nuclear negotiators fail reach to deal – a move that has put him at odds with the White House.

Menendez plans on temporarily stepping down as ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, a source with knowledge of the decision told ABC News.

Menendez is the 12th senator to be indicted while still serving in the Senate.

The last senator to be indicted was Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, who faced criminal charges due to not reporting hundreds of thousands of dollars in services he received during the renovation of his home. Stevens was convicted in 2008 but in 2009, a federal judge dismissed the conviction."
1G5iPbY,2015-05-07 00:00:00,"As California's Drought Worsens, Governor Announces New Water Restrictions - ABC News",http://abcnews.go.com/US/californias-drought-worsens-governor-announces-water-restrictions/story?id=30047515,"California Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. announced a set of mandatory water conservation measures today, as the state continues to struggle with a prolonged drought that has lasted for more than four years.

""Today we are standing on dry grass where there should be five feet of snow,"" Brown said in a statement after visiting a manual snow survey in the Sierra Nevadas. ""This historic drought demands unprecedented action.""

For the first time in the state's history, the governor has directed the State Water Resources Control Board to implement mandatory water reductions across California, in an effort to reduce water usage by 25 percent. The measures include replacing 50 million square feet of lawns throughout the state with drought-tolerant landscaping, banning the watering of grass on public street medians, requiring agricultural water users to report their water use to state regulators, and requiring large landscapes such as campuses, golf courses and cemeteries to make significant cuts in water use.

The governor’s announcement comes just a few weeks after NASA’s top water scientist, Jay Famiglietti, declared in a Los Angeles Times op-ed that California only had a year's-worth of water supply left in its reservoirs.

The last four years have been the driest in California’s recorded history. As of March 24, more than 98 percent of California is suffering from abnormally dry conditions, with 41.1 percent in an exceptional drought, according the U.S. Drought Monitor, which estimates that more than 37 million Californians have been affected by the drought. The state’s snowpack, which is largely responsible for feeding the state’s reservoirs, has been reduced to 8 percent of its historical average, and in some areas in the Central Valley the land is sinking a foot a year because of over-pumping of groundwater for agriculture.

In January 2014, Brown declared a state of emergency and directed state officials to take all necessary actions to prepare for water shortages. The announcement was quickly followed with the launch of a website, www.SaveOurWater.com, aimed to help Californians make reductions in water use. Tips include everything from reducing shower time to planting drought-resistant trees and plants.

“We are in an unprecedented, very serious situation,” the governor said in his January statement. “At some point, we have to learn to live with nature, we have to get on nature’s side and not abuse the resources that we have.”

Californians use an average of 181 gallons of water each day, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.

The winter wet season was a big disappointment for water conservationists. Half of the state’s annual rainfall usually arrives in December, January and February, and although there were brief stormy periods, California recorded less rain in January than any January before it: less than two inches. In March, the state announced emergency legislation to fast-track more than $1 billion in funding for drought relief and water infrastructure projects, after the State Water Board released a report outlining a steep decline in water conservation during the month of January.

California is not the only state struggling with drought. In Nevada, the Lake Tahoe Basin’s snowpack is reported to be at 3 percent of its normal average, prompting the primary water provider in the Reno-Sparks area to urge customers to cut water use by 10 percent on Tuesday. In Texas, more than half the state is currently suffering under abnormally dry conditions, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor."

Last week, she died of a brain aneurysm at the age of 49.

Colagrossi is one of an estimated 30,000 people in the U.S. who experience a rupture of a brain aneurysm, a bulging, weak area in the wall of an artery, according to the National Institutes of Health. Aneurysms typically form at the branches in the brain’s arteries where blood vessels are the weakest. The most common breaks occur at the base of the brain.

Approximately 40 to 50 percent of brain aneurysm ruptures are fatal, said Dr. M. Shazam Hussain, a neurologist with the Cleveland Clinic’s Neurological Institute.

“Many die before they make it to the hospital,” Hussain said. “Of those who survive, a third will go home, a third will have a disability and a third will die in the hospital.”

About 5 percent of people have a brain aneurysm, Hussain said. Fortunately, only about one in 10,000 of them will rupture and the vast majority of people with the condition live long, health lives, he added.

“The majority of time there are no symptoms leading up to the rupture until right before the bleed,” Hussain said.

When there are symptoms, Hussain describes them as “stroke-like,” including severe headache, difficulty speaking, weakness, vomiting and loss of consciousness.

Colagrossi, who collapsed while returning from a television shoot, was the typical age for a rupture Hussain said.

“You can see them in people as young as 18 but the average age is between 50 and 60,” he said.

The best way to save someone’s life when they've had a rupture of a brain aneurysm is to seek medical attention as soon as possible so they can be stabilized and treated, Hussain advised. Staying healthy, treating high blood pressure and avoiding tobacco is the best way to avoid one in the first place, he said.

Someone with a family history of brain aneurysm ruptures should talk to their doctor about the possibility of getting a brain scan, Hussain said. If one is discovered, doctors will often recommend regular monitoring but in high-risk cases they may be treated, he said.

Colagrossi joined ABC's New York station WABC days after the World Trade Center attacks in 2001. She is survived by her husband Todd, and their two sons, Davis and Evan.

Editor’s Note: A previous version of this story stated in the headline that 30,000 people die each year from aneurysms. In fact, 30,000 people experience brain aneurysm rupture each year."
1G6jcTB,2015-04-02 00:00:00,5 Habits of Vegetarians You Should Steal - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Health/habits-vegetarians-steal/story?id=30053239,"More and more of my clients consider themselves to be “part-time” vegetarians. While they may not want to give up meat altogether, they enjoy plenty of meatless meals or take part in ongoing movements, like Meatless Mondays. Today is another formal campaign focused on leaving meat off your plate: It’s the Great American Meat-Out, and getting on board can be a great opportunity to improve your health.

Even semi-vegetarians weigh less, and have lower risks of high blood pressure and diabetes. Plus, taking the focus off meat can be a simple way to boost your intake of plant-based foods you may not be eating enough of.

Here are five healthy veg-based habits you can adopt, even if you aren’t interested in embracing a total vegetarian lifestyle.

When I ask most of my omnivore clients what they had for dinner last night, they typically reply with meat first (e.g. “I had chicken with…”). Veggies are often an afterthought. Obviously my vegetarian and vegan clients don’t eat meat, but I advise everyone—including omnivores—to think about veggies first and build the rest of their meals around them. It’s key, because eating more veggies is one of the most impactful dietary changes you can make, but about 75% of adults fall short of the minimum recommended three daily servings.

Fitting in just one additional portion per day can slash your risk of heart disease by as much as 11%, and making veggies the star of your plate can lead to a myriad of benefits. From today on, when choosing what’s for lunch or dinner, select your veggies to start, then add lean protein, good fat, and healthy starch to round out your meal.

13 Ways to Make Veggies Taste Better

My hubby, who’s from Texas, grew up eating not just plenty of meat, but also meals made with other animal-based fats, like butter, and bacon grease, as well as lots of dairy based sauces. While he still eats these foods once in a while, he now prefers veggies sautéed in olive oil or dressed with EVOO and balsamic vinegar, as well as guacamole instead of sour cream, and sauces made from tahini (sesame seed paste) or nut butter—all staples for many vegetarians.

The switch has helped him lose weight, up his energy, and improve his health, and I see the same with many of my clients. Plant-based fats have been shown to reduce inflammation, a known trigger of premature aging and diseases, including obesity, and even help boost weight control and whittle waistlines—even without cutting calories (check out my previous post 5 Amazing Powers of Avocado). Make the switch more often yourself and monitor how you feel, as well as how your jeans fit.

14 Best Vegetarian Protein Sources

Pulses are my current obsession. Eating at least one serving a day is the cornerstone of my latest book Slim Down Now, and I truly believe that pulses are the most underrated superfoods on the planet. Pulses include beans, peas (e.g. chickpeas, black eyed peas), and lentils, and in numerous studies, eating more of them has been tied to weight loss, less belly fat, appetite suppression, a better overall nutrient intake, and a lowered risk of diabetes and heart disease. Vegetarians often opt for pulses as their protein source and there are plenty of delicious ways to enjoy them, including lentil or split pea soup, black bean tacos, and hummus.

Pea protein powder, also a pulse, is also becoming a hot plant-based protein. I love to whip it into smoothies, and use it as a protein-booster in oatmeal. In addition to providing protein, pulses are rich in filling, blood-sugar regulating fiber, as well as resistant starch, a unique kind of carb that’s been shown to naturally up your body’s fat-burning furnace. Pulses also pack antioxidant levels that rival berries, and they’re satisfying without making you feel sluggish. This Friday or any day, trade the meat in a meal for a serving of pulse, like cannellini beans, lentils, or oven-roasted chickpeas—they’ll fill you up while helping you slim down and stay healthy.

9 Reasons You Should Eat More Beans

While there are “junk food vegetarians,” many veg-heads make whole, plant-based foods their focus, including at snack time. Great options anyone can reach for include raw veggies with hummus or guacamole, fresh fruit with nuts, seeds or nut/seed butter, or a smoothie made with a plant-based “milk” (like almond or coconut) with fruit, leafy greens, and a plant-derived protein powder, such as pea or hemp. Even choosing dark chocolate over milk chocolate ups your plant-based game and boosts your antioxidant intake!

I love baking (check out this video for my 5 healthy baking swaps) and one of my favorite challenges is to find delicious ways to sneak more plants into my splurges. I’ve added puréed spinach to vegan brownies, and in Slim Down Now I incorporate pulses into several goodies, including whipping white beans into chocolate pudding, and using garbanzo bean flour to make pumpkin spice mini muffins. Nutritionists and chefs are incorporating produce into desserts in lots of interesting ways, from tomato sorbet and chocolate eggplant cake to mushroom meringue.

During a tour of the winning science projects at the White House on Monday, Girl Scout Troop 411 told Obama they generated their idea for a Lego-based automatic page turner during a group “brainstorming session.”

“You guys are already better brainstormers than I am,” the president told the girls, all clad in superhero capes.

The page-turning device -- embellished with multicolored bricks and Lego people -- was “working really well, although you gotta read kind of fast,” Obama observed. “Are you guys able to speed it up and slow it down?”

“It's a prototype! It will get refined later,” Obama said with a laugh. “That’s what I’m saying.”

“Have you ever had a brainstorming session yourself?” one of the girls asked POTUS.

“I have had a couple brainstorming sessions, but I didn't come up with anything this good!” the president said. “I came up with things like, you know, health care. Yeah, it turned out okay -- but it started off with some prototypes.”

“He was a lot more fun than I expected!” 6-year-old Karissa Chang said of Obama. “That was pretty awesome and pretty funny.”

Developing the Affordable Care Act “might take three months, just like it took for us,” Chang remarked to ABC News.

Other inventions on display at the White House today included a spinal implant that grows with the patient, an algae-based biofuel, and a hiccup-curing lollipop.

“These young scientists and engineers teach us something beyond the specific topics that they're exploring. They teach us how to question assumptions, to wonder why something is the way it is, and how we can make it better. And they remind us that there's always something more to learn, and to try, and to discover, and to imagine,” Obama said.

“We don't want to just increase the number of American students in STEM,"" the president added, referring in science, technology, engineering and math. ""We want to make sure everybody is involved. We want to increase the diversity of STEM programs, as well.”

Cierra Ramirez, who plays a teenage coder on ABC Family's “The Fosters” and attended the White House event as a VIP, said the fair shows young people -- especially young girls -- that “you can be both beautiful and smart.”

“Women don't really make up a lot of STEM, especially girls of color. So, to be able to represent both parts of that, and to hopefully inspire some young girls who watch the show to continue to follow their dreams, if they're interested in it, is awesome,” she said."

Bob Menendez, D-New Jersey, pleaded not guilty today to 14 counts of corruption, bribery and fraud in New Jersey.

""For nearly 3 years, the Justice Department has pursued allegations based on smears launched by political opponents trying to silence me,"" Menendez told reporters outside court. ""These allegations are false and I am confident they will be proven false and I look forward to doing so in court.""

Menendez may still travel abroad with his passport for work purposes.

Co-defendant Melgen also pleaded not guilty and was released on a $1.5 million bond. Melgen declined to comment.

The next hearing, which will be a status conference, is scheduled for April 22. The trial is tentatively scheduled for July 13.

The charges center on Menendez’s relationship with Melgen, a close Menendez ally and donor to the New Jersey senator, in connection with a bribery scheme in which the senator allegedly accepted gifts from Melgen in exchange for using the power of his Senate office to benefit the doctor's financial and personal interests.

The indictment includes allegations Menendez accepted close to $1 million worth of gifts and campaign contributions from Melgen between 2006 and 2013 in exchange for advocating on the behalf of the doctor, saying the senator ""used the prestige, authority and influence of his status as a United States Senator to promote Melgen’s personal and business interests.”

Late Wednesday night, Menendez announced he will temporarily step down as ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee."
1G7fh5R,2015-02-18 00:00:00,'American Sniper' Trial: Sister Says Eddie Routh 'Traded His Soul for a Pickup' - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/US/american-sniper-trial-sister-eddie-routh-traded-soul/story?id=29051272,"Accused killer Eddie Ray Routh seemed confused when he arrived at his sister's home a few hours after allegedly shooting Chris Kyle and Chad Littlefield, Routh's sister said today.

""He was talking about pigs sucking his soul,"" Laura Blevins testified during the trial.

Routh's sister and her husband Gaines Blevins were two of the witnesses the defense called to testify this morning in the double murder case. Kyle was a former Navy SEAL and the focus of the book and the movie ""American Sniper.""

But the clear star of the defense case so far has been Jennifer Weed, Routh's ex-girlfriend. She has given the jury the most powerful testimony yet of Routh's history of mental illness.

They spent the night before the murders together, she said, during which time Routh told her the government was listening to him. Routh asked her to not say anything out loud and write down anything she had to say so ""they"" wouldn't hear it, she said.

And then, out of nowhere, Routh asked her to marry him, Weed testified. On the morning of the crime, they fought about his tobacco use and she left, she said.

Laura and Gaines Blevins called 911 after Routh came to their Texas home on Feb. 2, 2013, and admitted killing the famed sniper and his friend at a gun range.

Laura Blevins said that she knew something was awry when her brother pulled up in a truck rather than his normal car, a Volkswagen Beetle that he had gotten painted to look like a ladybug.

The car he was driving on the evening of Feb. 2 was Kyle's SUV that he allegedly stole while fleeing from the scene.

""He said he traded his soul for a pickup,"" Laura Blevins said on the stand. ""The person who came to my house is not who I know as my brother.""

Gaines Blevins said that Routh ""said he took two souls before they could take his."" That claim is the same one Routh made again later that night to Texas Ranger Danny Briley, whose interrogation video was showed in court on Monday.

Today marks the first full day of the defense's case, and while they have never disputed that Routh killed Kyle and Littlefield, they are arguing that Routh was insane at the time of the shooting.

Under Texas law, that means that they will have to prove that Routh did not know what he was doing was wrong. He faces life in prison if found guilty.

Weed also told jurors about one of Routh's ""episodes"" two weeks before the murders. Routh grabbed some decorative ninja swords and held his girlfriend and her roommate hostage in their Dallas apartment, she told the court. He told them they couldn't leave because people were looking for them and the only safe place was the apartment, she recalled, noting that police finally came and Routh was taken to a mental hospital.

This is a shortened court day. The girlfriend is still on the stand and may be the last witness for today.

The drug-resistant superbug known as CRE was likely transmitted to the Los Angeles patients by contaminated medical scopes during endoscopic procedures that took place between October 2014 and January 2015, a university statement said.

The bacteria may have been a “contributing factor” in the deaths of two patients, according to the university.

Fears linger that more confirmed cases of the bacteria could emerge.

By one estimate, CRE, or carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae, can contribute to death in up to half of seriously infected patients, according to the national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The bacteria can cause infections of the bladder or lungs, leading to coughing, fever or chills. CRE infections have been reported in every state except Idaho, Alaska and Maine, according to the CDC.

UCLA said infections may have been transmitted through two endoscopes used during the diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic and bile-duct problems.

""We notified all patients who had this type of procedure, and we were using seven different scopes,” UCLA spokeswoman Dale Tate said. “Only two of them were found to be infected. In an abundance of caution, we notified everybody.”

A similar outbreak from contaminated medical scopes infected 32 people in Seattle from 2012 to 2014. Other superbug cases have been previously reported in cities such as Pittsburgh and Chicago.

Federal, state and local health officials are investigating the outbreak in Los Angeles, and warning letters, as well as home testing kits, have been sent to those potentially at risk.

The Associated Press contributed to this report."
1G8RSAq,2015-03-10 00:00:00,Oregon Community Donates Minivan So Boy Won’t Be Late to School Anymore - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/oregon-community-donates-minivan-boy-wont-late-school/story?id=29450439,"When a photo of a boy being punished at lunch for being late to school went viral, an Oregon community got together to make sure that didn’t happen again.

Hunter Cmelo and his family have a new minivan thanks to the local businesses in Medford, Oregon, and Grants Pass, Oregon, and a local radio host who heard his story.

The 6-year-old arrived late to Lincoln Elementary School last week because his family was having car trouble.

“[The school has] a policy where every three tardies, you get a detention,” Hunter’s mother, Nicole Garloff, 25, of Grants Pass, told ABC News. “Every tardy after that, you get a detention.”

Garloff said they knew Hunter would be getting a detention that day and that he was crying when he went in that morning. But she was shocked when she visited him at lunch that day and learned what his detention was actually like.

“He was at the first table as you walk into the cafeteria, and he was just sitting there with one of those cardboard poster partitions in front of him ... and two or three books next to him,” Garloff said.

She said the school policy was to have students make up work they missed because they were late. Since Hunter was only late by a few minutes, he didn’t have work to make up, so he was told to read a book.

“I was really upset. I went and got my iPad and took a picture of him,” said Garloff. “He wasn’t tardy so many times that he deserved that.

After Garloff posted the photo on her Facebook, the image of her son sitting alone at lunch went viral, coming to the attention of AM 1440 radio personality Bill Meyer. Meyer first heard about the story through his listeners and social media.

“We see a lot of bad news, or we have a lot of problems. So seldomly do we ever get a chance to fix the root of the problem,” Meyer told ABC News. “I saw the school policy as being unjust, but I saw the root of the trouble was car trouble.”

So Meyer reached out to Lisa McClease-Kelly, who owns Kelly’s Automotive, which is located in Medford and in Grants Pass, to see if she would be willing to repair the family’s Dodge Durango.

“The repairs were more than what the car was actually worth,” McClease-Kelly told ABC News. Luckily, a local company, Rapid Repo and Collections, offered to donate a 2001 Chrysler Town and Country van to the family.

Other local businesses pitched in to install a new windshield in the van, two new tires, and McClease-Kelly put about $1,400 of maintenance into it. Hunter’s family was surprised when they came to the shop this week.

“We thought we were going there to be told that our Durango was not going to be fixable at all,” Garloff said. “We were so shocked, it doesn’t seem real. I’m trying to tell Hunter that this doesn’t just happen to you.”

McClease-Kelly will give the family free oil changes for a year, and many others who heard their story donated to give the family a gas card, as well as gift cards to local restaurants.

“This family never asked for the help. All they ever wanted was to change the school policy,” Meyer said. “We saw a way to do a little nudge, and then everyone else came in with their time and generosity.”

The school policy has since been amended, according to the Grants Pass District Superintendent’s office.

“As a result of the concerns raised, the district ended the learning catch-up location at Lincoln Elementary School,” the Grants Pass District said in a statement. “Going forward, a separate, supervised classroom has been designated for necessary catch-up work.”

Garloff said Hunter hasn’t been late since the family got the van and that she is waiting to see if the school’s policy will change.

“We’re so thankful to all the people in our community that have just been so supportive,” Garloff said."

The unidentified 56-year-year-old man was admitted to John L. McClellan Memorial Veterans Hospital in Little Rock last May with weakness, fatigue, body aches and an elevated serum creatinine level, which meant his kidneys weren't functioning properly, according to the doctors' letter published in the New England Journal of Medicine Thursday.

The patient's urine sample was ""remarkable"" for its abundance of calcium oxalate crystals, Dr. Fyed Syed and Dr. Alejandra Mena-Gutierrez told ABC News today. Both doctors treated the patient and co-authored the letter along with Dr. Umbar Ghaffar, who was not immediately available for comment.

Calcium oxalate crystals are molecules that can put someone at high risk to develop kidney stones, Syed and Mena-Gutierrez said.

High levels of oxalate in the body is usually due to a genetic disorder, complications from gastric surgery or consumption of antifreeze, the doctors said, but the patient's history outlined in the letter didn't match any of those explanations.

An explanation was finally found after the patient admitted to drinking 16 eight-ounce glasses of iced tea daily, Syed and Mena-Gutierrez said, adding that black tea, ""a rich source of oxalate,"" accounts for 84 percent of tea consumed in the U.S.

Drinking 16 cups of tea daily, the patient consumed more than 1,500 milligrams a day, the doctors said. The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics advises consuming no more than 40 to 50 milligrams of oxalate per day, they added.

""The case presented here was almost certainly due to excessive consumption of iced tea,"" the authors wrote.

The doctors said they've had patients who've developed kidney stones from high-oxalate foods such as spinach, chocolate and coffee, but never nephropathy, or kidney damage.

""This is the first time we've ever heard of iced tea causing kidney damage and failure,"" Syed and Mena-Gutierrez said. ""It's certainly an interesting find for us.""

However, for those paranoid about drinking tea now, the doctors said they want to emphasize that tea in moderation is OK.

""If you're having two to three cups a day, you're probably OK as long as your family doesn't have a history of kidney disease,"" Syed said. ""Just don't drink in excess or replace water with tea, like this man did.""

The patient has since been discharged, but his kidneys are still non-functioning, and he receives out-patient dialysis treatment three times a week, Syed and Mena-Gutierrez said."
1G8xI9J,2015-03-06 00:00:00,Vanished Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 Still a Mystery 1 Year Later - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/International/vanished-malaysia-air-flight-mh370-mystery-year/story?id=29443649,"A year after it vanished, there still is no trace of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370, which many believe disappeared into the abyss of the Indian Ocean.

Theories of what happened to the plane have been swirling ever since, but no one really knows what occurred.

""I am a little surprised that we haven’t had something wash up on a beach that would tell us, yes, the airplane was in pieces, and was in the water,"" said John Nance, ABC News aviation contributor. ""I think that is still probably going to happen.""

The Boeing 777 left Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, en route to Beijing on March 8, 2014, when it lost contact with air traffic control as it flew over the Gulf of Thailand. The jet had 227 passengers, most of whom were Chinese, along with 12 crew members.

Here are some of the many open questions a year later:

Investigators believe the plane flew thousands of miles off course before crashing into the Indian Ocean. Australian officials still looking for the plane or its remnants say they are focusing on a search area of approximately 23,000 square miles west of the Australian city of Perth, and hope to find something that will provide answers to the plane's fate.

""The flight data recorder might be very helpful, certainly -- very helpful in terms of how the airplane entered the water,"" Nance said.

Malaysian authorities say the plane disappeared about an hour after it took off. However, no one is sure where the plane crashed, or even if it crashed at all. Some believe the plane is located in the southern part of the Indian Ocean, while others believe it flew into the northern part.

Speculation that the plane went north doesn't make sense to Nance, because it discounts evidence from satellite tracking systems. He added that finding the plane may be difficult because the southern Indian Ocean is a large body of water that is mostly unmapped.

Australia said it will continue to search for the plane.

Australian Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss said in a statement to Reuters on Sunday, ""We clearly cannot keep searching forever, but we want to do everything that's reasonably possible to locate the aircraft.""

Truss's office added it was optimistic about finding the plane, given that over 40 percent of the priority search area has already been covered.

If the plane isn't found by the completion of the search, the deputy prime minister’s office told Reuters, discussions will then be had between Australia, Malaysia and China about what to do next.

“If at the end of the search, there is nothing that has been found, I think it’s going to be very difficult for everybody,” Nance said.

Lippert is being treated for wounds to his face and subsequent wounds to his arm that he suffered when trying to fight off the attacker this morning.

Officials say the guard assigned to Lippert was an out-of-uniform Korean National Police officer and that it's customary in Seoul for police officers not to carry guns.

After the attack, Lippert was seen bleeding while escorted out of the building by attendees of the event.

The attacker, who is known to police as potential threat, was subdued in the street outside of the building shortly after.

All personal security for any given ambassador is decided upon by the Regional Security Officer and the ambassador himself.

Seoul is generally considered a low-threat post and one official described Lippert's security detail on Thursday as ""routine.""

Security for different posts varies greatly. The ambassador in a country like Yemen, for instance, could have multiple diplomatic security agents supplemented by a small military force, such as Marine guards.

The State Department announced that Lippert is currently recovering in a local hospital and that he says he is in ""great spirits."""

The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department arrested Erich Nowsch, 19, at a house only a block away from where the slain woman, Tammy Meyers, had lived with her family. Meyers' visibly upset husband, Robert Meyers, was standing nearby when the arrest was made after a two-hour standoff and was asked by police to back away from the area.

Police spokesman Christopher Tomaino said Nowsch was believed to be the only shooting suspect in the case but that police were still seeking another person involved.

Robert Meyers told reporters after the arrest that his family knew Nowsch and his late wife had had spent ""countless"" hours trying to help him.

""He knew where we lived,"" he said. ""We knew how bad he was.""

Tomaino said investigators were unaware that Meyers knew Nowsch.

Meyers said his wife and son went looking for Nowsch after the road rage incident because they knew him and where he lived.

Meyers said police have done an ""awesome"" job on the case.

Police revealed this week that Tammy Meyers and her armed son, Brandon, got in a car to look for the driver with whom she had a dispute last Thursday. She had been teaching her 15-year-old daughter how to drive in the parking lot of a nearby school.

After the incident on the road, Tammy Meyers drove home and asked her daughter to tell her 22-year-old son to come to the car. When the mother and son returned home, police said, the suspect's car pulled up. Gunfire erupted and Meyers was fatally wounded.

She died Saturday at the University Medical Center of Southern Nevada.

The United States has prime seats for a lunar eclipse set to take over the skies early Saturday morning, marking the third in a tetrad, a series of four eclipses.

The lunar spectacle will be the shortest in a century, lasting four minutes and 43 seconds.

The sky spectacle will be visible from all parts of the United States, with people in the eastern part of the country seeing the beginning stages of the partial eclipse before sunrise at 6:16 a.m. ET.

The total eclipse will be visible to people in the Western United States at 4:58 a.m. PT. At this time, the moon will turn a shade of blood red as it skims the outskirts of Earth's shadow.

The best part of all for the Easter weekend treat: No telescope is needed. If you're in an area with clear skies, all you'll need to do is step outside to enjoy the view.

If you find yourself hitting the snooze button, you'll have another chance to catch a lunar eclipse this year. The fourth and final in the tetrad is set for Sept. 28, 2015."

But even more improbable is that student Dylan Miller, 22, says he has already been living outdoors consistently for the past two years.

""I got sick of living in the dorms, and I thought I could save $4,000 a semester living outside, where I love to be,"" Miller told ABC News today. ""I'd set up hammocks in the woods, and I took shelter inside caves during the colder months.""

Last summer, his dad suggested he live in the woods for his senior project like American writers Henry David Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson, whom he had read avidly, Miller said.

Miller started building the circular hut in June in Juniata's Baker-Henry Nature Reserve using materials like donated wooden planks for the floors, fallen branches for the walls and tarp for the roof, he said.

The makeshift structure is minimally furnished: there's a small kitchen table and writing desk he built himself along with a small foldable bed and a chest for his clothes, he said.

Miller also has a small cooking stove and outdoor fire pit for cooking, and he showers in communal bathrooms on campus, he said, adding he also goes to campus to do computer work since he lives by candlelight in the hut near the Huntingdon, Pennsylvania, school founded by the Christian denomination Church of the Brethren.

And as for the cold, Miller said he's fine in 30-degree weather.

""I always wear shorts, and I only wore pants once this winter when the snow was really deep,"" he said. ""I also never wear a jacket.""

Miller admitted he has a portable propane heater for when it's below 10 degrees.

The survivalist enthusiast has also had run-ins with bears, his mother Amy Miller told ABC News today.

""I visited him one night last September, and I heard a bear snuffing around, and I was concerned,"" she said. ""He just went, 'Oh, yeah, that must be the female bear who lives around here,' really matter-of-factly.""

The minimalist outdoor living Miller is undertaking is all for his final undergraduate project called ""Content With Nothing,"" he said.

""The goal isn't to renounce society but to retreat into the woods and bring back the lessons I've learned living more simply,"" Miller said.

After he graduates, he will tear down the hut and live in an apartment in town, he said.

""You don't ever want to be stuck in a groove, and you should want to refresh yourself,"" he said. ""It's pretty hard for me to sleep inside at this point, so that'll be something I'll have to adjust to."""

Toni Elliot, 53, thought she hurt her tooth Thursday and alerted her server Eric Horton, the restaurant's general manager Greg Hargest told ABC News today.

""I went over to see if she was okay, and she goes, 'Oh yes, I just found this pearl in my mouth!'"" Hergest said. ""She started pulling out more pearls from her mouth, and the whole table started laughing.""

Elliot then picked at the oyster and discovered dozens of more baby pearls inside, Hergest said.

""We've never seen anything like this before,"" she added. ""We've had cases where someone might find one pearl, but this is the first time someone's found 50.""

They cleaned the pearls off and put them in a cup for Elliot to take home, Hergest said.

""It was her oyster, so they're her pearls,"" Hergest said. ""It's like winning the lottery. She was so excited to have them.""

Puckett's Boat House gets their oysters from the Gulf of Mexico off Louisiana, Hergest said.

Elliot did not immediately respond to ABC News' voicemail and email requesting additional comment.

Also no word on how much the tiny pearls may be worth."

Technically, replacement referee Shannon Eastin was the first woman to officiate an NFL game during the 2012 lockout. But breaking that barrier wasn't why Thomas got in the game, she told espnW in 2013.

""The thing is, I've never set out to be the first and that hasn't changed,"" said Thomas, who first started officiating football games in 1996. ""I do this because I love it.""

The NFL identifies promising college referees and Thomas has been in the NFL pipeline since 2013, although the NFL saw her potential long before that. She was on a course to be part of the NFL's training program, but an unexpected pregnancy in 2012 meant spending the season off the field before working her way back.

The mother of three got her start in officiating when she accompanied her brother to a meeting for people interested in calling football games. Then, Thomas was the only woman in the room, but she isn't the only woman in the NFL's pipeline.

Last season, Thomas and head linesman Maia Chaka were both in the development program."

""The notion that the West is at war with Islam is an ugly lie,"" Obama said. ""And all of us -- regardless of our faith -- have a responsibility to reject it.""

""We need to break the cycle of conflict, especially sectarian conflict, that have become magnets for violent extremism,” he added.

The president said that the coalition of 60 countries that has been conducting air strikes against ISIS “will not relent” to destroy the organization in Iraq and Syria.

“These terrorists are desperate for legitimacy,” Obama said, which is why he said they target Muslim communities.

Obama said both wealthy and developing nations need to take steps to improve the economic situation around the world, though he said poverty alone does not prompt someone to become a terrorist.

Obama said many people in countries with small Muslim populations get a distorted impression from news coverage. He specifically called out groups like women and young people to help prevent potential recruits from joining terrorist groups.

“Young people are not tapped for hate, it doesn’t come naturally to them. We adults teach them,” he said.

Obama continued to say that everyone has to work to bring more positive attention to the Muslim community.

“Groups like al Qaeda and ISIL peddle the lie that some of our countries are hostile to Muslims,” he said, adding that “we can’t allow cycles of suspicion to tear at the fabric of our cultures.""

Epstein, 69, was arrested in October 2013 for allegedly charging undercover FBI agents $60,000 to kidnap a man and coerce him into granting his wife a Judaic divorce decree.

Epstein and his son David, along with two other rabbis named in the federal complaint as Jay Goldstein and Binyamin Stimler, face federal charges of conspiracy to kidnap and kidnapping. If found guilty, the men face a maximum penalty of 20 years to life in prison.

During Wednesday’s opening statement, prosecutors played a video of allegedly Epstein discussing a staged kidnapping with two undercover FBI agents, wherein he can be heard openly discussing the use of stun guns on men's genitalia.

""If it can get a bull that weighs five tons to move,"" the man on the video identified by the FBI as Epstein is heard telling the undercover agents, ""you put it in certain parts of his body and in one minute the guy will know.""

""Mendel Epstein talked about forcing compliance through the use of 'tough guys' who utilize electric cattle prods, karate, handcuffs and place plastic bags on the heads of husbands,"" said FBI Special Agent Bruce Kamerman shortly after Epstein's arrest.

Epstein's defense claims he was a ""champion of women's rights"" and employed ""torture as term of art"" in order to get a husband's ""evil"" recalcitrance to ""leave his body."" According to the strictest interpretation of ancient Jewish law, a religious divorce, referred to as a ""get"", can only be granted by a husband regardless of the circumstances that may have caused a marriage to break up. Without a ""get"", a religious Jewish woman cannot remarry or get on with her life and she becomes an ostracized member of the community called an “agunah” or a chained person. Convincing reluctant husbands to grant their wives divorces is a specialty among ultra-Orthodox rabbis.

The defense is expected to tell the jury about the oldest interpretation of Jewish law that broadly outlines torture as a legitimate vehicle for convincing recalcitrant husbands to grant their wives religious divorces. Defense lawyer Robert Stahl said during his opening statements that ""the process is a legitimate divorce. It's not a criminal conspiracy."" He told the jury that ancient Jewish texts endorse the use of coercion and physical torture in an effort to convince men to grant their wives divorces.

U.S District Judge Freda Wolfson reminded Epstein's lawyers on day one of the trial that this type of defense is dangerous because the lawyers are essentially asking the jury to overrule federal criminal law.

The trial, which is expected to last five weeks, stems from a lengthy investigation that started more than two years ago in an ultra-Orthodox enclave in Lakewood, N.J. After three alleged victims came forward, undercover FBI agents posing as a disgruntled wife and her brother, lured Epstein into allegedly describing his methods in incredible detail on audio and video recordings. Also on the video prosecutors say the rabbis are shown stretching as if they're warming up for a fight.

Epstein, who is an internationally known expert in Jewish divorce and author of an authoritative book on the matter, boasts that he has participated in 2,500 divorces."

Ray Hinton, 58, was released from jail at 9:30 a.m. today, a member of Jefferson County Judge Laura Petro's staff confirmed to ABC News.

Judge Petro had ordered his release, according to the Equal Justice Initiative.

Today was a ""joyous event,"" said Hinton's attorney Bryan Stevenson, ""although a tragic one, as well.""

Hinton was convicted in 1985 of two murders in Birmingham, according to The Associated Press, largely based on evidence from bullets at the crime scene. But new testing showed that the bullets couldn't be connected to Hinton, the AP reported.

Stevenson, an attorney for the Equal Justice Initiative, the group that helped win his release, said the organization has been involved in Hinton's case since 1999.

The group conducted testing on the weapon ""the state said was sole evidence of finding him guilty of these murders,"" Stevenson told ABC News today, and ""the testing revealed that the Hinton weapon was not used in these crimes.""

But for 15 years, Stevenson claimed, the state ""refused to do the testing.""

The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2014 that Hinton had inadequate counsel and sent the case back for a second trial, the AP reported, and then prosecutors moved to dismiss the case after the bullet testing.

New bullet testing results came back this Wednesday night, Stevenson said, and ""the state acknowledged Mr. Hinton would not be accused of these crimes.""

Stevenson called his client Wednesday night to tell him the good news.

Stevenson said he told Hinton, ""You are going home.""

""And he said, 'I don't believe it.' He was overjoyed.""

""When you're locked down in a solitary cell for 30 years... with the state trying to execute you... to be told you're finally going home, is a kind of joy that's hard to imagine,"" Stevenson said.

At this morning's release, Hinton, who is not giving interviews, wore a suit for the first time in 30 years, Stevenson said.

After he signed the release papers, ""they gave him his meager possessions,"" Stevenson recalled: a pair of sneakers, a belt and a couple of books.

Then they walked out of the jail and met his family and friends.

""Now he's heading back to his home where he'll spend the weekend recovering,"" Stevenson said.

""He's going to take his time and just try to recover from the challenges of confinement,"" he added. ""We'll meet next week and begin trying to sort out how to put his life back together again.""

Hinton's release is ""enormously gratifying,"" Stevenson said, but ""it's also frustrating that so many years were taken away from him unnecessarily.""

The Associated Press contributed to this report."
1GayjLH,2015-05-21 00:00:00,Follow This Transgender Teen’s Transition to Match His Identity Before Adulthood - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Health/follow-transgender-teens-transition-match-identity-adulthood/story?id=30053490,"When Nathan* was a fourteen-year-old, he was like a lot of boys his age. He loved rocking out, riding his bike and sports of all kinds. But there’s more to him than meets the eye.

Anatomically, Nathan is female and was originally born a little girl named Natalie.

Transgender Teen Reunites With Second Grade Counselor Who Helped Him Get Through Life

“I always remember just being different from all the other girls. You know, they would want to play with Barbies and do other girlie things, and I always wanted to play with the boys,” Nathan, from Phoenix, Arizona, told “Nightline.” “I always thought I was different than any of the girls, and from a young age, I was really adamant that I was a boy.”

He's so adamant that at 4 years old, the pre-schooler said, “I’m a boy,” and as a second grader, wrote flyers that said, “I am not a girl. I am a boy,” to hand out to classmates.

Back then, his parents missed the signs.

“We really fed into society’s way of saying that, you know, what does a four-year-old know?” Nathan’s mother Tammy told “Nightline.”

“You know, you ask a four-year-old, ‘What do you want to be?’ And they say, ‘Superman,’ … next week, it might be ‘Spiderman,’” Jim, Nathan’s father, told “Nightline.”

They assumed Natalie was just a tomboy who preferred boy’s clothing and toys. But, finally at age of 13, Natalie asked to be called Nathan, coming out to them as transgender.

“I've always felt like I've had a boy's brain,” said Nathan. “And I always felt like I was trapped in this girl's body.”

“If someone were to wake up in the wrong body, they would be the same way,” he explained. “They'd be uncomfortable. They'd be freaking out. And that's what it's like. You just feel uncomfortable.”

Tammy and Jim accepted Nathan as their son and started using male pronouns. And now with their support and help, he is one of growing number of transgender kids who are transitioning both socially and medically, all before adulthood.

“It’s finally giving him what he needs,” said Tammy, who said she regrets not realizing it sooner.

In 2011, they had already consulted with physicians and therapists as they prepared to launch Nathan into the first generation of transgender kids, and they agreed to let “Nightline” document the transformational journey over several years.

In going public with their story, they asked for tolerance and recognition for what the “opposite path” looks like. In the last six months, at least six transgender teens have committed suicide because they felt unsupported by parents or peers, according to news reports. In fact, a staggering 41 percent of transgender youth will attempt suicide before age 25, according to studies on the population.

“Little kids, you know, have a hard time dealing with these feelings,” Dr. Marvin Belzer, who helps run the largest transgender youth clinic in the county at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, told ""Nightline."" “Then they get into adolescence, and their body starts going through the wrong puberty. And it just becomes a panic. And they get depressed and suicidal.”

For teens in particular, those feelings are often compounded by social stigma and prejudice. “The percentages [of] how many were spat on and how many were hit, how many had to drop out of school, are horrendous,” he said.

Current estimates are that one out of every thousand children is transgender, according to Belzer.

“So, if you have a school of a thousand kids,” he said, “you probably have one.”

Click through to follow Nathan's journey.

*Nathan is a pseudonym used at the family’s request.

“Nightline” first met Nathan when he was 14 years old in 2011. He and his parents were preparing for his multi-phase transition.

“Five years on testosterone will get a lot of the irreversible changes that he wants, and the voice change, that won't go back, and hair growth and things like that,” said Tammy. “So, then we'll go from there.”

Both she and her husband Jim said they believed the transition was crucial for Nathan’s happiness, because living as girl had made him a depressed and angry child.

His early preference for boyish clothing made him look ambiguous and brought a lot of ridicule. Tammy said in the fifth grade he was assaulted by a group of boys who brutally kicked him in the genitals because they were unsure if he was a boy or a girl. Concerned for his safety, she pulled him out of school and started home schooling instead. He returned to public school for junior high, but Nathan said the cruelty continued.

“People started thinking of me as, ‘the weird kid’ and ‘the different one,’” he said. “I got taunted in the halls. People would, you know, go by and call me, ‘Princess,’ or, ‘girlie,’ or stuff like that, and it was hard.”

At 14, Nathan said it was easier to take classes online, but it left him depressed and even more isolated.

“It's hard. You know, I want to be able to hang out with people, you know, go do regular teenage things. And now, it just feels like I don't have anyone to talk to,” Nathan said.

He tried his best to pass as a boy, but he said his high voice and female breasts were painful reminders of his brain-body mismatch.

“Puberty was a big hard point in my life,” he explained, “I felt like my body was betraying me.”

Every day he wore a thick bra-like tank top to bind his breasts down and frequently hunched over.

“I want my boobs gone, I don’t want them -- I never wanted them in the first place,” he said.

As part of his physical transition, he had just started drugs that suspended his period, similar to an early menopause.

“Going through your period is something that’s hard for a girl,” he said, “but for a guy it’s just completely embarrassing and wrong.”

In the future, Tammy and Jim hope Nathan can re-enter school as a male and be accepted by greater society as the gender in which he identifies. So, after three months of waiting for a hearing date, they went to court to legally change his name.

“Nathan is now officially our son. He doesn’t have to have his female name any longer,” Tammy said.

“I’m going to remember this day as one of the greatest days of my life,” Nathan said, outside the courthouse.

Afterwards, his family held a celebration complete with a cake that said, “It’s a boy,” and Tammy sent out birth announcement cards as a way of letting friends and family know.

“I just say, ‘Help us in accepting and loving and welcoming our son, and then as of this date, she will no longer be she,” Tammy said, displaying the card.

While some critics believe transitioning youth before adulthood is a mistake because they might change their minds, Nathan said he felt male his entire life and did not think he would ever regret any part of his transition.

“This is something I’m going forward with,” he said, “and it’s something that I’ve really wanted.”

According to Dr. Belzer, children under 11 years old do sometimes remit on their transgender feelings, but he said, after 12 years old those feelings are usually set. “The important thing is that you support them and give them a loving environment,” Belzer said, “letting them know, should their feelings persist, there are options to change, if they want to.”

Transgender feelings are not a choice, Belzer said, citing brain and genetic differences that are currently under research. And, considering the difficulties of transitioning, as well as the stigma, he said, “It's clear that these people would not choose to have to go through this life.”

Throughout the summer, Nathan saw an endocrinologist in preparation for cross-gender hormone treatment. At home, he created a paper chain to countdown the days to his first shot of testosterone.

“When I get down to one, it’s gonna be one of the happiest days of my life,” he said.

“To have that coursing through his veins, is just what's going to be making him happy,” said Tammy.

In July, he got his first shot. Over time, the testosterone will masculinize his body. His voice will lower, and he will develop more body hair and muscle mass. His breasts will shrink some, and his ovaries and uterus will go dormant. To maintain the effects, he will have to inject the hormone every two weeks for the rest of his life. There are also controversial, irreversible side effects, including potential infertility.

“Nightline” asked Jim and Tammy what they would say to critics who might say ""Don’t mess with nature,"" and ‘What if he changes his mind?"" Jim responded, “You can look at it that way, but you can look at it this way, too: would you rather have a happy kid or would you rather have a dead kid?”

Jim said, for him, the answer was clear.

Because hormonal treatment is relatively new for transgender children, some critics caution the long-term impacts are not completely known. “There is some truth to that matter,” said Dr. Belzer. “Except in medicine, we have to weigh the risks of doing nothing…the risks of doing nothing are actually pretty horrendous.”

“If we can help them pass in life, their life is just going to be so much easier,” Belzer explained, “They're not going to have the prejudice and stigma.”

After his first testosterone shot, Nathan went to a Trans support group that his mother helped him find. Though technically an adults group, they welcomed the teenager and helped him celebrate with Testosterone-themed cupcakes.

A year later, Nathan’s parents made the bold decision to allow him, at age 15, to get a double mastectomy to remove his breasts; also known as “top surgery.”

“My parents were [originally] thinking, you can have that when you’re 18. From there it sort of evolved to, okay we need this now,” said Nathan.

“When I first started doing this type of surgery, I didn’t see any patients who were minors,” said Dr. Michael Brownstein, the reconstructive surgeon who performed the procedure. “And now I see a respectable number.”

He said minors like Nathan need permission from both parents, and that Nathan had letters of referral that indicated he was capable of making the decision and that the procedure was appropriate for him.

“I think ... Nathan is going to be quite pleased,” said Dr. Brownstein.

Though the procedure costs almost $10,000, not covered by insurance, Tammy said it was worth the financial sacrifice.

Several months later, Nathan’s chest had healed from the top surgery, and he felt comfortable enough to go for a swim for the first time in years.

“It's been forever since I've been at a pool and felt comfortable being in a pool with my shirt off, so I mean, I can't even describe the feeling,” he said.

“It’s amazing,” added Tammy. “This is exactly why, you know, we wanted to do the top surgery. We wanted him to be able to do things that kids do, and that is what he is doing now.”

“To see him smile again and be comfortable in his own skin, that’s the best,” said Jim.

When he started driving, Nathan also got a driver’s license with his new name and gender listed as male.

“New name, new gender, new everything really,” he said.

Three years after beginning his transition, Nathan, 17, is a visibly masculine, confident young man. He returned to a large public high school and graduated, wearing the blue cap and gown designated for senior boys.

“This is how I dreamed it would happen,” he said. “I'm graduating as a boy, not as a girl like I was afraid of.”

Before he transitioned, he said it hurt to look in the mirror, but now he could do that proudly. “This is the way I’ve always wanted to look, and this is the way I’ve always imagined myself being,” he said.

“If we didn’t transition for sure, we wouldn’t either have a child or he would be a very angry person,” Tammy said. “We had a really angry girl. The more counseling we got and the closer we got to things, we saw this child blossom.”

“I know if I had to live as a girl now… I would most likely be very depressed,” said Nathan. “Hopefully not, but I most likely would have tried to kill myself.”

Looking back, he said he was grateful for his parent’s support and he also shared a powerful memory of a school counselor whose indelible words comforted him for over a decade.

Her name was Amy Spletter and Nathan, then Natalie, was sent to her office in the second grade because he had been telling his classmates he was a boy.

Transgender Teen Reunites With Second Grade Counselor Who Helped Him Get Through Life

“I remember she sat me down in her office and she said to me, ‘There's other people like you and you're not alone,’” said Nathan. “So, I always thought that was the most profound piece of advice ever and it kept me going from second grade on.”

He had lost contact with her, but “Nightline” tracked her down and soon Nathan was on her doorstep to see her and thank her after all those years.

“Look at you! Oh, my gosh!” exclaimed Amy, opening the front door with tears in her eyes. “Oh, that's my wish and my dream come true,” she said, embracing Nathan.

“You sat me down and you just told me that there were other people like me,” he told her. “I never heard that before… I thought I was the only one.”

“It has kept me going all these years,” he continued. “Just the fact that you said that to me meant so much.”

Amy said she could never forget him either and that in her twenty-year career, she kept only one file: Natalie/Nathan’s. She took it out to show him, and inside were the flyers he had made in the second grade that declared, ‘I am not a girl,’ ‘I am a boy’.

“I couldn’t do anything big,” explained Amy, “but I could be there every day when Natalie needed to talk.”

Nathan said he doesn’t want another transgender kid to have to go through life thinking they’re different or wrong.
“They need that one person that says, ‘You-- you're all right’,” he said. “That's what matters, is just having one person.”

In his case, he had three: his caring parents and a counselor who made all the difference."

""The notion that the West is at war with Islam is an ugly lie,"" Obama said. ""And all of us -- regardless of our faith -- have a responsibility to reject it.""

""We need to break the cycle of conflict, especially sectarian conflict, that have become magnets for violent extremism,” he added.

The president said that the coalition of 60 countries that has been conducting air strikes against ISIS “will not relent” to destroy the organization in Iraq and Syria.

“These terrorists are desperate for legitimacy,” Obama said, which is why he said they target Muslim communities.

Obama said both wealthy and developing nations need to take steps to improve the economic situation around the world, though he said poverty alone does not prompt someone to become a terrorist.

Obama said many people in countries with small Muslim populations get a distorted impression from news coverage. He specifically called out groups like women and young people to help prevent potential recruits from joining terrorist groups.

“Young people are not tapped for hate, it doesn’t come naturally to them. We adults teach them,” he said.

Obama continued to say that everyone has to work to bring more positive attention to the Muslim community.

“Groups like al Qaeda and ISIL peddle the lie that some of our countries are hostile to Muslims,” he said, adding that “we can’t allow cycles of suspicion to tear at the fabric of our cultures.""

Shuts Down Email After Cyber Attack - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/US/state-dept-shuts-email-cyber-attack/story?id=29624866,"The State Department shut down large parts of its unclassified email system today in a final attempt to rid it of malware believed to have been inserted by Russian hackers in what has become one of the most serious cyber intrusions in the department’s history, U.S. officials told ABC News.

“The Department is implementing improvements to the security of its main unclassified network during a short, planned outage of some internet-linked systems,” State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in a statement to ABC News.

The outage could last though the weekend, according to officials. But as of now there is no time limit and no real indication of when the system will be back online.

Last November, the State Department conducted similar repairs to its system stemming from a cyber-attack it suffered the month before. The attack targeted the unclassified email system and is believed to have been executed by Russian hackers.

Officials stress that throughout this process, including the attack in October, there was never any compromise to the department’s classified systems.

News of this latest outage comes as presidential hopeful and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is in the midst of a political controversy stemming from her exclusive use of a private email address and home-based server during her tenure as the nation's top diplomat.

In a news conference Tuesday where she addressed the email scandal, Clinton said her server was guarded by the Secret Service and “there were no security breaches.”"

The state's Department of Justice's Division of Criminal Investigation is investigating the Friday shooting of Tony Robinson, officials said today. Wisconsin law requires an outside agency to investigate officer-involved shootings.

""We all deserve to know the facts in this case,"" Madison Mayor Paul Soglin said in a statement Saturday. ""Tony Robinson's family deserves that, our community deserves that, and the Madison Police deserve that. When the answers come, we will be open and transparent in communicating them.""

Robinson, 19, was jumping in and out of traffic on Friday night and allegedly responsible for a recent battery, Madison Police Chief Mike Koval said.

Madison Police Officer Matt Kenny, a 12-year veteran of the department, went to an apartment where he thought Robinson had gone, Koval said. The officer heard a disturbance inside and entered, where an altercation with Robinson began, the police chief said.

Koval said Kenny then shot Robinson, who later died at the hospital.

""Nineteen years old is too young,"" Koval said at a news conference, adding that Robinson was unarmed.

""He was a great kid. He is a great kid,"" said Robinson's grandmother, Sharon Irwin. The family was expected to make a statement during a news conference Saturday afternoon.

Kenny, 45, was also injured, said Koval, but his injuries were not disclosed. The officer was placed on administrative leave with pay pending the outcome of the investigation.

Kenny was involved in a police-involved shooting in 2007 and was exonerated of any wrongdoing, said Koval.

After the Robinson's death, demonstrations condemning the shooting began. A crowd gathered where the shooting happened and then left. Some people then headed to the downtown building that houses the Madison Police Department's Central District offices.

""As a parent, I can only imagine the heartbreak they must be feeling right now in the wake of this tragedy,"" Wisconsin Attorney General Brad Schimel said in a statement. ""Likewise, I am concerned for the officer involved in this incident, who I imagine is experiencing great trauma, as well. They are all in my thoughts and prayers.""

Schimel added that the department will conduct a ""thorough, professional and transparent investigation.""

On Sept. 12, 2014, state trooper Alex Douglass was shot in the pelvis during Frein's ambush, which took place during a late-night shift change at the State Police barracks in Blooming Grove, Pennsylvania.

Douglass has undergone 16 surgeries and has another one scheduled in April, he told ABC News affiliate WNEP-TV Saturday at a road naming ceremony for Cpl. Bryon Dickson, who died in the attack.

""I feel good,"" Douglass said to WNEP-TV. ""I'm getting better and now I'm off the crutches. Our department was tremendous during this horrific tragedy. That's what really kept me motivated and just looking on into the future.""

And Douglass' future could include returning to the state police.

""I don't want anything to hold me back,"" Douglass said, according to WNEP-TV. ""It will be an honor to go back to the Pennsylvania State Police.""

Frein was captured in October after a 48-day manhunt. At times, 1,000 officers searched the Pocono Mountains for Frein, who police said had planned his attack and hiding for years. The lives of residents in the area were disrupted by the manhunt, which forced school closings and event cancellations.

Frein pleaded not guilty to all charges, according to the Associated Press.

1GdccRS,2015-02-21 00:00:00,Kurt Busch suspended indefinitely - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/kurt-busch-suspended-indefinitely/story?id=29116354,"Earlier Friday it was ruled that Busch smashed his ex-girlfriend Patricia Driscoll's head against his motor home wall Sept. 26 at Dover International Speedway, according to the conclusions of a Kent County (Del.) family court commissioner who granted Driscoll's request for a protective order Monday.

""Given the serious nature of the findings and conclusions made by the Commissioner of the Family Court of the State of Delaware, NASCAR has indefinitely suspended driver Kurt Busch, effective immediately,"" NASCAR said in a statement. ""He will not be allowed to race nor participate in any NASCAR activities until further notice.

""Kurt Busch and his Stewart-Haas Racing team are fully aware of our position and why this decision was made. We will continue to respect the process and timetable of the authorities involved.""

Busch on Friday night filed paperwork for an appeal on his suspension, which will be heard at noon ET Saturday in Daytona, NASCAR spokesman David Higdon said.

""We are extremely disappointed that NASCAR has suspended Kurt Busch,"" Busch's attorney, Rusty Hardin, said in a statement Friday afternoon. ""We assure everyone, including NASCAR, that this action against Mr. Busch will turn out to be a travesty of justice, apparent to all, as this story continues to unfold.""

Hardin, who cannot represent Busch in the NASCAR appeal because the appeal process does not allow for lawyers to represent NASCAR members, reiterated his hope that the family court commissioner reconsiders his opinion based on additional evidence that would show Driscoll is not credible.

""It is important for everyone to remember that the commissioner's report has to do with a civil, family law matter and no criminal charges have been filed against Mr. Busch,"" Hardin said. ""We ask everyone's patience as this case continues in the court of law and are confident that when the truth is known Mr. Busch will be fully vindicated and back in the driver's seat.""

NASCAR appeals are heard by a three-member panel selected from a list of former drivers, racing promoters and racing executives in the NASCAR rule book.

During the appeal, NASCAR will present its evidence, Busch will make his argument and then they both are permitted opportunities for rebuttal. Both sides can bring witnesses but not legal counsel, and the panelists can summon any NASCAR member from whom they want to hear.

If Busch loses the appeal, he can make one last appeal to former Gulfstream president Bryan Moss, NASCAR's final appeals officer. NASCAR chairman Brian France also has the ability to lift the suspension at any time.

It wasn't immediately clear if Busch wins his appeal whether he could still drive for SHR, which gets a significant amount of financial support from Chevrolet.

In her statement, Driscoll said she did not consider this a ""victory.""

""For victims of domestic violence there are no victories,"" she said. ""My only hope is that the pain and trauma I suffered through this process will help other victims find their voice."
1GET95W,2015-03-11 00:00:00,"Sigma Alpha Epsilon Racist Chant Was 'Taught to Us,' Fraternity Member Says - ABC News",http://abcnews.go.com/US/sigma-alpha-epsilon-racist-chant-taught-us-fraternity/story?id=29548668,"One of the students identified in a video of University of Oklahoma fraternity members reciting a racist chant said “the song was taught to us,” but Sigma Alpha Epsilon denied that the chant originated at the national organization, blaming the since-shuttered chapter.

“I admit it likely was fueled by alcohol consumed at the house before the bus trip, but that’s not an excuse,” Parker Rice, 19, said in a statement released Tuesday to the Dallas Morning News. “Yes, the song was taught to us, but that too doesn’t work as an explanation.”

Rice, who attended a Catholic high school in Dallas, is seen in the video leading his fellow University of Oklahoma fraternity members in the chant, “There will never be a n***** at SAE.”

“In separate statements, the two men who have been expelled from the university have mentioned that the song was ‘taught to us,’” the fraternity said in a statement released late Tuesday. “However, as has been maintained in previous statements, the national fraternity does not teach such a racist, hateful chant, and this chant is not part of any education or training.

“Our investigation has found very likely that the men learned the song from fellow chapter members, which reiterates why Sigma Alpha Epsilon did not hesitate to close the chapter completely because of the culture that may have been fostered in the group.”

The fraternity was founded in 1856 at the University of Alabama and now features about 15,000 members across more than 200 chapters.

Matt Lopez, Rice’s former dorm mate on the Norman, Oklahoma, campus, blamed the incident on Rice’s trying to fit in.

“I know Parker, he’s not racist. He’s really not … he compromised his morality for the liking of his friends,” Lopez said Tuesday.

Rice said the incident that was caught on video was ""likely was fueled by alcohol,"" but ""that's not an excuse.""

""I am deeply sorry for what I did Saturday night,"" he said in a statement emailed to The Associated Press by his father. ""It was wrong and reckless.""

Another fraternity member, Levi Pettit, was also identified as a participant after the video appeared. His parents, Brody and Susan Pettit, released a statement Tuesday saying they were “shocked and saddened” by what they saw in the video.

""As parents of Levi, we love him and care for him deeply,"" they said. ""He made a horrible mistake, and will live with the consequences forever. However, we also know the depth of our son's character. He is a good boy, but what we saw in those videos is disgusting.”

University of Oklahoma President David Boren said the students who played a leadership role in the ""exclusionary"" chant had created a hostile learning environment. He said the chant was heard not only by those on a bus, but also affected the entire university community because it was distributed through social media.

""I have emphasized that there is zero tolerance for this kind of threatening racist behavior at the University of Oklahoma. I hope that the entire nation will join us in having zero tolerance of such racism when it raises its ugly head in other situations across our country,"" Boren said.

According to Boren's letter, if the expelled students disagree with the decision, they can contact the school's Equal Opportunity Office by Friday.

The university has not confirmed the identities of the expelled students."

And not to put too fine a point on it, the Data Security and Breach Notification Act of 2015, in its current form, has a long way to go before it should become the law of the land.

The Data Security and Breach Notification Act of 2015, “aims to tackle the nation’s growing data security threats and challenges.” So far, that sounds pretty good to me. The bill was authored by Energy and Commerce Committee Vice Chairman Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) and Rep. Peter Welch (D-VT), making it a bipartisan effort. The goal: to implement “a comprehensive plan to help safeguard sensitive consumer information and shield Americans from the harmful consequences of cyber attacks.”

I’ve written elsewhere about the need for a federal breach notification law, so in theory I’m on board. A strong federal law that requires businesses and government entities to inform people that their personal information has been compromised in a data breach can absolutely be a good thing…if it’s done right.

The problem with this proposal is that there are far more effective laws already on the books in several states, and they could be preempted were the bill to pass. If that weren’t bad enough, the proposed bill could also supersede stronger rules already put in play by the FCC with regard to telephone, broadband Internet, cable and satellite user information.

The undermining of better laws is bad, but worse is the way the Data Security and Breach Notification Act of 2015 underscores a continuing failure of our leaders to fully understand the nature of the problems we face in the mare’s nest that is consumer privacy and data security. In a widely publicized survey conducted by the Pew Research Center, “91 percent of adults in the survey ‘agree’ or ‘strongly agree’ that consumers have lost control over how personal information is collected and used by companies.” Data breaches, and the identity theft that flows from them, have become the third certainty in life. We need a strong federal law, but as I argued in my op-ed about the Data Breach Disclosure Box, any proposed bill that threatens to weaken existing laws has to be challenged, quickly and without equivocation.

1GFue2b,2015-03-12 00:00:00,'Dirty Brigades': US-Trained Iraqi Forces Investigated for War Crimes - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/International/dirty-brigades-us-trained-iraqi-forces-investigated-war/story?id=29193253,"U.S.-trained and armed Iraqi military units, the key to the American strategy against ISIS, are under investigation for committing some of the same atrocities as the terror group, American and Iraqi officials told ABC News. Some Iraqi units have already been cut off from U.S. assistance over ""credible"" human rights violations, according to a senior military official on the Pentagon's Joint Staff.

The investigation, being conducted by the Iraqi government, was launched after officials were confronted with numerous allegations of “war crimes,” based in part on dozens of ghastly videos and still photos that appear to show uniformed soldiers from some of Iraq's most elite units and militia members massacring civilians, torturing and executing prisoners, and displaying severed heads.

“As the ISF [Iraqi Security Forces] and militias reclaim territory, their behavior must be above reproach or they risk being painted with the same brush as ISIL [ISIS] fighters,” said a statement to ABC News from the U.S. government. “If these allegations are confirmed, those found responsible must be held accountable.""

[In an image posted on Instagram, six black-uniformed men who appear to be Iraqi Special Operations Forces from the “Golden Brigades” surround an alleged ISIS suspect who has been dragged with a rope or cable tied to his foot.]

Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, along with international human rights advocates and military experts, called the photos evidence of Iraqi ""war crimes.""

""I guarantee you ultimately we get blamed for it whether we did it or not,"" Leahy predicted.

Under what is known as the Leahy Law, the U.S. is required to cut off funds to any foreign military unit when there is “credible evidence” of human rights violations. In Iraq the responsibility of determination falls to the Department of Defense. In recent Senate testimony, Secretary of State John Kerry confirmed the Iraqi investigation had been ordered and said the Leahy Law applies to units operating alongside the many militias also fighting in Iraq against ISIS.

""I would say that involves the Leahy Law,"" Leahy recently told ABC News after viewing the shocking imagery. “And I'd argue that we should be withholding money.""

According to the Pentagon, the U.S. already has. In a statement to ABC News, the Joint Staff official revealed that in the months since the U.S. began airstrikes and military assistance to Iraq last August, “We have withheld assistance from certain Iraqi units on the basis of credible information in the past. Due to the sensitive nature of our security assistance, we are unable to discuss specific units.”

In Washington today, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Gen. Martin Dempsey told lawmakers the U.S. military is keeping a close eye on the militias as well.

""What we are watching carefully is whether the militias -- they call themselves the popular mobilization forces -- whether when they recapture lost territory, whether they engage in acts of retribution and ethnic cleansing,"" he said.

An Iraqi government spokesperson previously said while the dozens of photos could be ISIS propaganda, a full investigation was warranted.

“Yes, of course we will investigate these pictures,” the spokesperson, Gen. Saad Maan, said in an interview in Baghdad as he viewed a selection of images provided by ABC News.

""We don't have anything to hide,” the general said. “We don't have anything to be in, let's say, in a black corner.""

[A bound and blindfolded detainee appears to be dropped – or possibly hung from the neck according to one analyst -- from what looks like an Iraqi military base guard tower. The image was posted on Instagram.]

The Iraqi military is key to the U.S. strategy to fight ISIS and stop its atrocities, which have outraged the world. The U.S. is shipping almost $1 billion in weapons, as well as providing U.S. military trainers to instruct new Iraqi recruits. A special operations official in Baghdad, however, said it’s the government of Iraq that decides — not the Pentagon — which Iraqi units get U.S.-donated weapons, such as 43,000 M4 rifles and thousands of other light infantry weapons Congress approved for shipment in December. American troops are not known to be operating on the ground in combat in Iraq or Syria. No Americans are shown in the images or footage ABC News has found, nor have any Americans been implicated in any of the alleged atrocities.

Officials from Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International who reviewed the library of horrors assembled in the ABC News investigation said it is rare to see so much visual evidence of human rights abuses.

""Usually when forces commit such crimes they try to hide them. What we are seeing here is a brazen, proud display of these terrible crimes,"" Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East Executive Director at Human Rights Watch, said in an interview as she and the group's lead investigator in Iraq, Erin Evers, surveyed the carnage.

ABC News came upon the first such images last September, when a reporter following personal Instagram accounts of Iraqi counter-terrorism troops spotted a video of a handcuffed prisoner shot in the head by a man in camouflage -- which more than 600 users ""liked."" The English and Arabic captions by a self-identified member of the Iraqi security forces said, “We have arrested this terrorist yesterday and we killed him after completion of interrogation.""

A separate photo posted in September showed the severed head of a long-haired and bearded alleged ISIS fighter lashed to the grill of a U.S.-donated Humvee bearing an Iraqi Army license plate. A second related photo eventually surfaced of what appeared to be an Iraqi Army soldier holding up the same severed head next to the gun truck. Desecration of war dead and extrajudicial killings are violations of the Geneva Conventions.

""You don’t behead someone and place their head on the front of your Humvee. That’s unacceptable -- because it’s a war crime. And it’s an atrocity,"" retired U.S. Army Special Forces Lt. Col. James Gavrilis told ABC News.

As a senior officer in 5th Special Forces Group in Iraq a decade ago, Gavrilis was deeply involved in counterinsurgency during the U.S. war and creating Iraqi counter-terrorism units from Special Forces and special police teams.

""I think it’s horrible. I think this really shows a failure of our policy for Iraq,"" Gavrilis said, confirming that the imagery looked authentic and too plentiful online to be faked.

""Both sides are committing war crimes,"" he said. ""This is widespread, it’s endemic.""

[A man wearing a uniform with a patch that appears to be from the Emergency Response Brigade steps on two severed heads in a photo posted on Instagram.]

In another video posted online in October, two unarmed civilians are shot to death after being questioned, and denying, whether they were part of ISIS. When the camera pans to one man with a gun, he appears to be wearing a uniform and shoulder patch of Iraqi Special Forces, with Iraqi Army officers also nearby observing the atrocity.

Fighters who appear to be a mix of militia and army appearing in a separate 78-second video circulating in January — including some wearing Iraqi flags and Iraqi Special Forces patches — take pictures of a captured teenaged boy who appears terrified. “Didn’t you just shoot?” demands one fighter. The handcuffed boy, shoved to the ground, insists, “No, no, I did not shoot a single bullet.”

The men argue over whether to kill him, some asking the others to calm down, but they shoot him to death anyway as the sound of mortars and gunfire nearby punctuate the crime. “This is to avenge the martyrs,” one man says.

“I've seen all sorts of horrible things over the years... but I have never seen anything this bad in my life,” said Ali Khedery, an American former diplomat in Baghdad who advised five U.S. ambassadors in the Iraqi capital and three generals overseeing Middle East operations at U.S. Central Command.

Khedery recently wrote in Foreign Policy about another video, where a man was beaten and machine gunned to death by a gang who appeared to be both militias and Iraqi Special Forces with U.S.-donated M4A1 rifles. He said the video slaughter of the Iraqis accused by their killers of smuggling weapons for ISIS was far worse, because Iraqi government troops were present.

“It was the shooting of unarmed men. This is a U.S.-backed government. They carried U.S. weapons,” he said.

U.S. and Iraqi authorities say they have been working to fully authenticate the content posted online on sites such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter connected to the Iraqi military. The uniforms and insignia of Iraqi Special Operations Forces under the command of Baghdad’s Counter-Terrorism Forces as well as special police and Emergency Response units from the Ministry of the Interior are clearly identifiable in many of the photos and videos, which include many severed heads and corpses dragged behind humvees.

Gen. Maan, the Iraqi government spokesperson, claimed the patches identifying Iraqi military units could be bought on Iraqi streets and that the gruesome images could be a clever ploy by ISIS to discredit the Iraqi military.

""It does not look like ISIS propaganda at all,"" Gavrilis said. ""I don’t know how we could support them, if they are spearheading a lot on the front lines alongside these militias, and if they are conducting these kinds of atrocities as well... These Shi’a militias are just as barbaric as ISIS.""

Some militias take pride in their atrocities and appear to often be calling the shots on the battlefield, not the government forces, BloombergView columnist Eli Lake found when he recently visited the front lines north of Baghdad.

Officials said that the State Department's human rights observers and military intelligence had viewed examples of Iraqi Security Forces posting atrocities on personal social media for over a year. But one knowledgeable U.S. official said that since ABC News began asking about the many disturbing images last fall, the atrocities allegations against Iraq’s fighting forces have grown “more severe” and the “very concerning” allegations are being raised at high levels in Baghdad.

The Pentagon spokesperson told ABC News the U.S. military has ""discussed with Iraqi leaders the paramount importance of maintaining high standards of conduct and protecting civilian populations of all sects.""

""The actions of a small minority, if left unchecked, could do serious harm to the efforts of the Iraqi government,"" the spokesperson said.

With several thousand American troops back in Iraq as trainers, the alleged atrocities by Iraqi troops puts U.S. military commanders in the unenviable position of having to sort out which units are clean or dirty, Gavrilis said.

[The severed head of an alleged ISIS fighter is being held up by a desert camouflage-uniformed individual in front of a Humvee in this image uploaded to Instagram. Patches on his uniform match those often worn by the Iraqi Army.]

The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights last month released a report on Iraq that both condemned ISIS for its campaign of killings verging on genocide, but also criticized Iraqi Security Forces for military operations that ""which may have amounted to war crimes.""

Last March, the State Department's Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor also issued its own damning report on Iraq, stating that government officials under then-Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki committed ""extrajudicial killings"" -- meaning battlefield executions of ISIS suspects and killing individuals in custody without trial.

""Ministry of Interior officials tortured detainees to death, according to reports from multiple government officials and human rights organizations,"" read the annual report. The Bureau explicitly fingered the Iraqi Counter-Terrorism Forces and Interior Ministry's special police units -- which the U.S. established, trained and armed from 2003-2011, and whose troops are seen in many of the atrocities images.

But the State report was issued before the U.S. began airstrikes in Iraq last August to assist security forces in successfully retaking the Mosul Dam, and long before President Obama deployed thousands of American infantrymen, special operations forces and enablers back into Iraq beginning last fall to assist the Iraqis in fighting ISIS. A new report is expected soon, officials said.

Now that the alleged war crimes of the U.S.-backed forces have become public, the Iraqi spokesman stressed that his government will not tolerate “bad behavior.”

Using the Arabic slang for ISIS, Gen. Maan said, ""We do not allow any person to be a savage like Daesh.""

1GFuE8R,2015-03-12 00:00:00,'Dirty Brigades': US-Trained Iraqi Forces Investigated for War Crimes - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/International/dirty-brigades-us-trained-iraqi-forces-investigated-war/story?id=29193253,"U.S.-trained and armed Iraqi military units, the key to the American strategy against ISIS, are under investigation for committing some of the same atrocities as the terror group, American and Iraqi officials told ABC News. Some Iraqi units have already been cut off from U.S. assistance over ""credible"" human rights violations, according to a senior military official on the Pentagon's Joint Staff.

The investigation, being conducted by the Iraqi government, was launched after officials were confronted with numerous allegations of “war crimes,” based in part on dozens of ghastly videos and still photos that appear to show uniformed soldiers from some of Iraq's most elite units and militia members massacring civilians, torturing and executing prisoners, and displaying severed heads.

“As the ISF [Iraqi Security Forces] and militias reclaim territory, their behavior must be above reproach or they risk being painted with the same brush as ISIL [ISIS] fighters,” said a statement to ABC News from the U.S. government. “If these allegations are confirmed, those found responsible must be held accountable.""

[In an image posted on Instagram, six black-uniformed men who appear to be Iraqi Special Operations Forces from the “Golden Brigades” surround an alleged ISIS suspect who has been dragged with a rope or cable tied to his foot.]

Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, along with international human rights advocates and military experts, called the photos evidence of Iraqi ""war crimes.""

""I guarantee you ultimately we get blamed for it whether we did it or not,"" Leahy predicted.

Under what is known as the Leahy Law, the U.S. is required to cut off funds to any foreign military unit when there is “credible evidence” of human rights violations. In Iraq the responsibility of determination falls to the Department of Defense. In recent Senate testimony, Secretary of State John Kerry confirmed the Iraqi investigation had been ordered and said the Leahy Law applies to units operating alongside the many militias also fighting in Iraq against ISIS.

""I would say that involves the Leahy Law,"" Leahy recently told ABC News after viewing the shocking imagery. “And I'd argue that we should be withholding money.""

According to the Pentagon, the U.S. already has. In a statement to ABC News, the Joint Staff official revealed that in the months since the U.S. began airstrikes and military assistance to Iraq last August, “We have withheld assistance from certain Iraqi units on the basis of credible information in the past. Due to the sensitive nature of our security assistance, we are unable to discuss specific units.”

In Washington today, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Gen. Martin Dempsey told lawmakers the U.S. military is keeping a close eye on the militias as well.

""What we are watching carefully is whether the militias -- they call themselves the popular mobilization forces -- whether when they recapture lost territory, whether they engage in acts of retribution and ethnic cleansing,"" he said.

An Iraqi government spokesperson previously said while the dozens of photos could be ISIS propaganda, a full investigation was warranted.

“Yes, of course we will investigate these pictures,” the spokesperson, Gen. Saad Maan, said in an interview in Baghdad as he viewed a selection of images provided by ABC News.

""We don't have anything to hide,” the general said. “We don't have anything to be in, let's say, in a black corner.""

[A bound and blindfolded detainee appears to be dropped – or possibly hung from the neck according to one analyst -- from what looks like an Iraqi military base guard tower. The image was posted on Instagram.]

The Iraqi military is key to the U.S. strategy to fight ISIS and stop its atrocities, which have outraged the world. The U.S. is shipping almost $1 billion in weapons, as well as providing U.S. military trainers to instruct new Iraqi recruits. A special operations official in Baghdad, however, said it’s the government of Iraq that decides — not the Pentagon — which Iraqi units get U.S.-donated weapons, such as 43,000 M4 rifles and thousands of other light infantry weapons Congress approved for shipment in December. American troops are not known to be operating on the ground in combat in Iraq or Syria. No Americans are shown in the images or footage ABC News has found, nor have any Americans been implicated in any of the alleged atrocities.

Officials from Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International who reviewed the library of horrors assembled in the ABC News investigation said it is rare to see so much visual evidence of human rights abuses.

""Usually when forces commit such crimes they try to hide them. What we are seeing here is a brazen, proud display of these terrible crimes,"" Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East Executive Director at Human Rights Watch, said in an interview as she and the group's lead investigator in Iraq, Erin Evers, surveyed the carnage.

ABC News came upon the first such images last September, when a reporter following personal Instagram accounts of Iraqi counter-terrorism troops spotted a video of a handcuffed prisoner shot in the head by a man in camouflage -- which more than 600 users ""liked."" The English and Arabic captions by a self-identified member of the Iraqi security forces said, “We have arrested this terrorist yesterday and we killed him after completion of interrogation.""

A separate photo posted in September showed the severed head of a long-haired and bearded alleged ISIS fighter lashed to the grill of a U.S.-donated Humvee bearing an Iraqi Army license plate. A second related photo eventually surfaced of what appeared to be an Iraqi Army soldier holding up the same severed head next to the gun truck. Desecration of war dead and extrajudicial killings are violations of the Geneva Conventions.

""You don’t behead someone and place their head on the front of your Humvee. That’s unacceptable -- because it’s a war crime. And it’s an atrocity,"" retired U.S. Army Special Forces Lt. Col. James Gavrilis told ABC News.

As a senior officer in 5th Special Forces Group in Iraq a decade ago, Gavrilis was deeply involved in counterinsurgency during the U.S. war and creating Iraqi counter-terrorism units from Special Forces and special police teams.

""I think it’s horrible. I think this really shows a failure of our policy for Iraq,"" Gavrilis said, confirming that the imagery looked authentic and too plentiful online to be faked.

""Both sides are committing war crimes,"" he said. ""This is widespread, it’s endemic.""

[A man wearing a uniform with a patch that appears to be from the Emergency Response Brigade steps on two severed heads in a photo posted on Instagram.]

In another video posted online in October, two unarmed civilians are shot to death after being questioned, and denying, whether they were part of ISIS. When the camera pans to one man with a gun, he appears to be wearing a uniform and shoulder patch of Iraqi Special Forces, with Iraqi Army officers also nearby observing the atrocity.

Fighters who appear to be a mix of militia and army appearing in a separate 78-second video circulating in January — including some wearing Iraqi flags and Iraqi Special Forces patches — take pictures of a captured teenaged boy who appears terrified. “Didn’t you just shoot?” demands one fighter. The handcuffed boy, shoved to the ground, insists, “No, no, I did not shoot a single bullet.”

The men argue over whether to kill him, some asking the others to calm down, but they shoot him to death anyway as the sound of mortars and gunfire nearby punctuate the crime. “This is to avenge the martyrs,” one man says.

“I've seen all sorts of horrible things over the years... but I have never seen anything this bad in my life,” said Ali Khedery, an American former diplomat in Baghdad who advised five U.S. ambassadors in the Iraqi capital and three generals overseeing Middle East operations at U.S. Central Command.

Khedery recently wrote in Foreign Policy about another video, where a man was beaten and machine gunned to death by a gang who appeared to be both militias and Iraqi Special Forces with U.S.-donated M4A1 rifles. He said the video slaughter of the Iraqis accused by their killers of smuggling weapons for ISIS was far worse, because Iraqi government troops were present.

1GH426l,2015-03-30 00:00:00,Senator Demands Release of Hopkins Black Lung Report - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/US/senator-demands-release-hopkins-black-lung-report/story?id=30005460,"U.S. Sen. Robert Casey, Jr. is demanding to see the findings of Johns Hopkins internal review of a controversial radiology program that for years reviewed x-rays of coal miners on behalf of coal companies and rarely found miners to have serious black lung disease -- decisions that helped prevent them from obtaining much-needed financial support.

“My constituents and coal miners and their families who have suffered the effects of black lung and the wrongful denial of black lung benefits claims are waiting for answers,” wrote Casey, a Pennsylvania Democrat, in a letter to Johns Hopkins Medicine CEO Dr. Paul Rothman Friday. “In the interest of full disclosure and transparency, I strongly urge you to publicly release the findings of your review.”

Nearly a year-and-a-half later, the school has completed its review, but won’t say whether medical opinions from Johns Hopkins doctors were skewed to favor coal companies over America’s coal miners.

“The review has always been intended as an internal evaluation and will remain confidential,” said Kim Hoppe, a Johns Hopkins spokeswoman.

Hoppe said Johns Hopkins doctors have not resumed reading lung x-rays for the coal industry, which paid millions of dollars to have doctors from the renowned hospital render their expert opinions in black lung benefits cases. Scores of those medical readings were used by coal company attorneys to thwart claims from coal miners who believed they were entitled federal financial relief because they had been stricken with black lung disease while working underground, the ABC News-CPI investigation found.

“Given the alarming findings of the investigative reports into the matter, I am surprised that, after almost a year and a half, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine has chosen to withhold findings that have clear implications for miners and their families, the American public and the federal government,” Casey wrote in his letter to Rothman.

“There are still many questions left unanswered following the revelation that since 2000 Dr. Wheeler had not found one case of complicated pneumoconiosis in over 1,500 black lung claims and in more than 3,400 x-ray readings,” Casey wrote. “The coal miners whose x-rays were read by Dr. Wheeler and their families deserve more information.”

Hoppe told ABC News earlier in March that “decisions coming out of the review are being deliberated.”

Among the miners affected by Dr. Wheeler’s x-ray readings was Michael “Steve” Day of West Virginia, who died in 2014. As in dozens of other cases, an autopsy found that, contrary to Dr. Wheeler’s opinion, Day did indeed have advanced black lung disease and should have been eligible for benefits.

“It proved to everybody that [Dr. Wheeler] was wrong,” said Patience Day Williams, Steve Day’s daughter. “We knew it all along.”

Day’s autopsy report said his lungs were clogged with coal dust – the disease had spread into 85 percent of his lungs."

At Pizza Ranch in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, on Saturday, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush was peppered with questions on everything from GOP strategy to Alzheimer’s funding and flooding.

Bush, who said he envisioned a “hopeful and optimistic” campaign - if he decides to mount one - told potential supporters that Republicans must “get outside of our comfort zone.”

“Young people have had eight years of President Obama, and he turned them on, to begin with,” he added. “The thrill is gone.”

Bush also criticized the president’s stance on net neutrality. Last month, the FCC voted to reclassify Internet service providers as common carriers and impose regulations similar to those imposed on utilities.

The @FCC just voted to keep the internet open & free. That's the power of millions making their voices heard. Thank you! #NetNeutrality -bo

“The president steamrolled the FCC,” he said. “The idea of regulating access to the internet with a 1934 law is one of the craziest ideas I’ve ever heard.”

This weekend marks Bush’s first foray into Iowa politics since he last visited the Hawkeye State in October 2012. And in Iowa, retail politics are a potential candidates’ bread-and-butter – or, corn-and-pork.

“We are first in the nation, and we love it,” Joni Scotter, a Marion resident who is considered one of Iowa’s most highly-sought out volunteers, told ABC News. “If a candidate doesn’t get their noses right in front of our faces, oops, they’ve lost a vote. And I’m not kidding you, it’s a serious business.”

Scotter added that some of the volunteers are ""very snobby.""

“We’re used to having them come,” he said. “I’m not kidding you.”

Bush, who acknowledged that he needs to distance himself from his identity as “George’s boy or Barbara’s boy or W’s brother,” sought to re-brand himself.

“I’ve been on my own journey,” he said, touting his record as governor and his time in commercial real estate.

Though his surname has given some political pundits pause, many of the locals gathered at the Pizza Ranch to meet Bush were unconcerned – for them, his family’s political legacy is a point in his favor.

“I like the Bushes. The old man - I voted for him. I voted for George for the two terms he was in there,” said Ed Osbourn, a material handler in Cedar Rapids. “I’d probably vote for Jeb.”

“I think that he’s a strong candidate and I think he will be able to overcome any of the baggage with the name,” said Shelia Anderson, who owns a math learning center in Cedar Rapids.

The Pizza Ranch was so crowded that the proprietor was forced to ask unregistered guests to leave or risk shutting the event down.

But for those who were crowded out, never fear, Bush – who noted he has yet to make his 2016 decision – promised, “If I get beyond where we are today, I’ll be back here a lot.”"

""We'll be getting new health insurance and we'll presumably do it through my job with the Senate, and so we'll be on the federal exchange with millions of others,"" Cruz said in an interview with CNN Tuesday.

Cruz and his family currently have health insurance coverage through his wife’s employer, Goldman Sachs. Cruz's wife, Heidi, is a managing director at the company and will take a leave of absence to campaign for her husband, causing her family to lose their healthcare coverage, according to CNN.

Most members of Congress are required to obtain healthcare coverage through the federal exchanges established by Obamacare. The exception is for those who are covered by Medicare or receive coverage through their spouses, like Cruz previously did.

“Well, it is written in the law that members will be on the exchanges without subsidies just like millions of Americans so that's – I think the same rules should apply to all of us. Members of Congress should not be exempt,” Cruz told the Des Moines Register.

Throughout his three-year Senate career, Cruz has been on a crusade to repeal Obamacare - most notably when he led a 21-hour filibuster against the president's healthcare plan on the Senate floor in 2013. The tactic caused many people to blame Cruz for the government shutdown that lasted for 16 days.

Cruz launched his presidential campaign yesterday on the five-year anniversary of the president signing the Affordable Care Act into law and committed to repealing the legislation if he becomes president in 2017.

""Instead of the joblessness, instead of the millions forced into part-time work, instead of the millions who've lost their health insurance, lost their doctors, have faced skyrocketing health insurance premiums, imagine in 2017 a new president signing legislation repealing every word of Obamacare,"" Cruz said at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia Tuesday."
1GKV1Y2,2015-03-03 00:00:00,"Pregnant Women Turn to Alternative, 'Personalized' Birthing Options - ABC News",http://abcnews.go.com/Health/pregnant-women-turn-alternative-personalized-birthing-options/story?id=29337459,"Giving birth is the most primal act in a woman’s life. And yet, modern medicine has turned birthing into a sterile, medical procedure, often performed in a hospital operating room.

But more and more women are rejecting the traditional hospital approach to delivery in favor of a more “personalized” birthing experience, with some literally going back to their primal roots by trekking into the wilderness to give birth.

""Born in the Wild” is a new reality TV show, which debuts on Lifetime on Tuesday at 10 p.m.. It features expectant mothers who chose to give birth outside in the woods. Peter and Audrey Bird, who live in Alaska and have two children and a third on the way, are featured on the show. They said they had a negative experience in the hospital with the birth of their 6-year-old son.

""My labor was full of fear,"" Audrey, 25, says on the show. ""That's not something that I ever wanted to do again.”

So to welcome their daughter Piper, they decided to go into the great outdoors to give birth in a makeshift tent, with no medical professionals.

""I’m excited to have my baby outside in Alaska,"" Audrey said. ""We’re surrounded by the lake, the trees, and the clouds, and the mountains. It’s absolutely breathtaking. We are about a hundred miles from the nearest road. No power lines run to the property, no phone lines, we don't have a sewer system. On this side of the lake, it’s just us. There’s no neighbors. There’s no other families nearby. So we are very isolated.""

Practicing OBGYN and ABC News contributor Dr. Jennifer Ashton said, while extreme, more women are taking control of their labor and delivery.

""I think there's no question we're certainly hearing a lot more about alternative births,"" Ashton said. ""I think in large measure that comes because women are growing more and more dissatisfied with what’s being offered by their doctor, by their board certified OB or even in some cases by a certified nurse midwife, and it’s pushing them to seek out these more extreme birthing experiences.""

In suburban New Jersey, Cheryl and Terrance Suydam decided to have all three of their children born at home.

With their third child, Cheryl planned to give birth in a tub set up in the family's living room, with two midwives and her husband on hand. In the final stages of labor, she decided instead to move to the family sofa, which had been covered in plastic. After 21 hours of labor, Cheryl delivered a healthy baby girl.

Throughout Suydam's delivery, the couple's two other kids, Livvy and Alex, who were ages 3 and 6 at the time, and even the family dog, freely walked in and out of the birthing room.

Out-of-hospital births are far from the norm. Only around 1 percent of births in the United States are done outside of a hospital, according to the most recent statistics from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

""The fact of the matter remains, that in obstetrics, there can be life and death, last minute emergencies that are unexpected, unanticipated, and if they occur outside of a safe hospital or birthing center setting can be disastrous for the mother or the baby,"" Ashton said.

But more U.S. hospitals are seeing the trend of mothers wanting options and now offer a variety of birthing experiences, including Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee.

Jennifer Horn had her son Seth at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, and although it was her third time giving birth, it was the first time she was able to watch her baby being born.

Horn had previously given birth to two children via C-section, but for her third child, she decided to try Vanderbilt’s “family-friendly” C-section option."

""When I heard the song I forgot to eat or drink. I was just listening. I kept practicing and practicing until I learned it by heart,” Muqqadas told BBC News.

From a poor family near Lahore, Pakistan, neither sister speaks English so they meticulously sounded out the words and transliterated the lyrics into Urdu.

A version of the video was posted to Facebook on February 17, and has since wracked up 1,965,033 views. Soon after, local TV channels came knocking and the sisters were invited to perform live.

Their mother Shahnaz Tabaydar, who can be seen tapping a pot in the original Facebook video, admitted to BBC News she shared her daughters’ Bieber Fever.

Albert Manero, a college student who builds and donates low-cost, 3-D printed bionic limbs to kids around the world, put the two together as part of Microsoft's Collective Project.

And their meeting was captured on video, which Downey posted on Twitter today.

""Honored to present a bionic #IronMan arm to Alex through @MSOneNote’s #CollectiveProject,"" Downey tweeted. ""Check the bowtie. #dapper.""

In the video, you can see Downey greeting young Alex in a dapper red bow tie.

As the pair sit down to check out the bionic arms Downey brought along in metal cases marked Stark Industries, Alex is asked if he knows who Downey is.

""Iron Man,"" he replies without hesitation, causing everyone, including Downey, to break into laughter.

Asked if he knows Downey's name, Alex replies, ""Robert,"" to which Downey responds, ""Great!""

The pair then put on and compare their bionic arms.

""I'm having a technical glitch,"" Downey tells Alex in the video, as the light on his Iron Man arm continually flashes. ""Half the time I design one of these, it winds up breaking on me. But what I do is I keep working on it, kind of like you're working on it with Albert.""

""He keeps working and working until he gets it right,"" Alex replies.

Later, Downey praises Albert.

""Albert has made it so affordable,"" the actor said. ""I'm probably going to start farming out a lot of my tech work to Albert, too. I feel like he could cut down the price point on one of my suits, which is I guess about now a billion and a half dollars.""

The world's oldest cat, Tiffany Two, turns 27 today, or 125 in human years, according to Guinness World Records.

Tiffany's owner, Sharron Voorhees, told ABC News she thinks her cat's longevity can be pinned to her devotion and her small size.

""Tiffy's just so devoted to me, she doesn't want to leave me."" Voorhees, 73, said. ""But I think it could also have to do with her size. She's only six pounds, and I know smaller dogs live longer than older dogs.""

And fun fact: Tiffany is a ""feisty"" cat with a lot of ""sex appeal,"" her owner said.

""She's had many boyfriends over the years,"" Voorhees said. ""One young male cat used to always run and want to see her even when she was already 13 or 14. I also used to have a big 20-pound black-and-white cat who she'd cuddle and spoon with.""

Voorhees used to have a Tiffany ""One"" in the '70s, who died early from cancer, she said. She saw Tiffany Two when she passed a local pet shop in 1988 that was going out of business that day, she said.

""I saw the little kitty who looked just like my old Tiffany, and though I went home, I just kept thinking about it,"" Voorhees said. ""They were both short-haired and black-and-orange tortoiseshell colored.""

Voorhees went back a few minutes before the pet shop closed for good, she said, and adopted Tiffany, who was six weeks old at the time.

""I paid $10, and I always say that was the best investment I ever made,"" Voorhees said. ""We're inseparable. She gets very emotional when I pet her. She drools.""

Shortly after, Voorhees got two dogs, whom Tiffany got along well with, she said.

""They'd run around the house together, and she'd help him escape the play pen I kept him in whenever I had to leave the house,"" Voorhees said. ""They've been long gone, but I still have two other dogs and two cats who are family to Tiffany.""

Happy Birthday Tiffany Two! World's oldest cat living is 27 today http://t.co/cFyejtTXRd #cats pic.twitter.com/n3POHxPdek

Despite Tiffany's old age, she's still a healthy cat, Voorhees said.

""She's not feeble, she can go up and down the stairs and goes outside when she pleases,"" Voorhees said."

The first egg belonging to the viral couple at Corodus State Park hatched on Tuesday, and was captured on a webcam set up by the Pennsylvania Game Commission.

The birds have attracted the attention of viewers from around the globe, especially when they were spotted sheltering their eggs in the snow in early March.  As snow had piled up on the birds’ nest, one of the eagles placed its body over the eggs.

Besides becoming stars online, the birds have attracted an audience much closer to their nest.

Residents at the Country Meadows retirement facility in York, Pennsylvania, have been watching the eagles in their nest for months, according to a report by ABC News affiliate WHTM-TV.

“It was great to see it because I’ve never seen one before like that,” resident Martha Orner told WHTM-TV.

Bonnie Gesinger, director of community life at the facility, told the television station that residents have been watching the eagles since December.

“Residents come knock on my door. They say, ‘When are you putting the eagles up?’” Geisinger told WHTM-TV.

Now that at least one of the eggs has hatched, all eyes will be focused on watching the fledgling grow until it is expected to leave the nest in late June or early July, according to the Pennsylvania Game Commission."

""Several other incidents with chapters or members have been brought to the attention of the headquarters staff and leaders, and each of those instances will be investigated for further action,"" the apologetic fraternity said in a statement Monday night.

The national office, which has disbanded the local chapter, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The video, which surfaced over the weekend, was posted to Twitter by Unheard, which describes itself as ""an alliance of black students organized for change within campus administration and atmosphere.""

The video shows young men on a bus chanting, ""There will never be a n***** at SAE.""

The Unheard tweet, directed at OU president David Boren, said, ""Racism is alive at The University of Oklahoma.""

Boren said in a statement Monday that all ties and affiliations between the school and chapter are ""hereby severed.""

As for the song, a former member of the Oklahoma SAE chapter told ABC News he doesn't know whether it originated at Oklahoma or elsewhere.

""I hope it didn't start where I was,"" said Will James, an SAE at Oklahoma from 2001 to 2005. ""But I really don't know.""

James, 31, believes he was the second African-American member of the Oklahoma SAE chapter and doesn't think there has been another since him.

The Edmond, Oklahoma, musician said he thinks the racist song has ""probably"" been sung at other SAE chapters.

""We would find songs from other chapters,"" he said, adding, ""singing on the bus rides is a tradition we did.""

But James said they didn't sing ""anything like that song"" when he was a student. ""When I was there, I don't believe anyone would have stood for anything like that,"" he said.

SAE has an official song book, James said, as well as ""songs that just rise out of tradition.""

He said most of the official songs were about fraternity symbolism, while the songs that came from tradition ""celebrated drinking and partying."" But ""no one was ever taken down by any song we had,"" he added.

While James said he no longer has a copy of the song book, he said the racist chant was ""definitely not in the official book.""

""When we have those bus rides to date parties, we would sing our songs from the book and what we picked up from tradition,"" he said. ""Everyone knew the words and sang along.""

James said he considered the chapter diverse when he was in school.

""There were Middle Eastern members, there were Hispanic members, we were all over the place,"" he said. ""We had various socioeconomic backgrounds and nobody cared, it was inclusive. And so, I just I can't imagine how that culture has shifted so far to allow that song, or any song that would be disparaging to anybody is happening at that house."""
1GNpyY8,2015-03-13 00:00:00,Florida Military Helicopter Crash: Decorated Marine Among Those Killed in Training Accident - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/US/florida-military-helicopter-crash-decorated-marine-killed-training/story?id=29619161,"Among the men killed in a military training accident this week was the 2013 Marine of the Year, who just last week was awarded the Silver Star, the military’s third-highest decoration for valor.

Staff Sgt. Andrew Seif, 26, was one of 11 veteran Marines and soldiers conducting a training mission off the Florida coast when their UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter crashed, killing all on board during a nighttime operation in foggy conditions.

A second Black Hawk involved in the exercise managed to return to base safely. There is still no explanation as to what caused the crash.

Seif and the six other Marines on board were members of the highly-trained Marine Special Operations Command, known as MARSOC.

MARSOC identified the six other Marines as Capt. Stanford H. Shaw, III, 31, from Basking Ridge, New Jersey, Master Sgt. Thomas A. Saunders, 33, from Williamsburg, Virginia, Staff Sgt. Marcus S. Bawol, 26, from Warren, Michigan, Staff Sgt. Trevor P. Blaylock, 29, from Lake Orion, Michigan, Staff Sgt. Liam A. Flynn, 33, from Queens, New York, and Staff Sgt. Kerry M. Kemp, 27, from Port Washington, Wisconsin.

The crew of the Black Hawk helicopter were from the Louisiana National Guard and had extensive experience. The two pilots had thousands of hours of flight time and had reached “instructor” status, one of the highest designations pilots can achieve. The Louisiana National Guard members have not yet been identified.

The remains several individuals killed in the accident will be received Friday at a private ceremony at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware.

The years of experience between the men lost compounds the tragedy. In 2013, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Martin Dempsey was present when Seif, a Holland, Michigan, native, became “Marine of Year” at a USO Gala in Washington D.C.

""I mourn the loss of so many brave men, including Sgt. Andrew Seif, the 2013 Marine of the Year,” Dempsey said in a statement to ABC News. “Their loss a reminder to us that those who serve put themselves at risk both in training and in combat. And we will work with the services to ensure their family members will be well cared for.”

It was just one week ago today that Seif was awarded the Silver Star at a ceremony in Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, for his actions in a July 2012 mission in Afghanistan. Seif’s close friend, Sgt. Justin Hansen, was killed in that raid targeting a high-profile Taliban bomb-maker.

""There are definitely some individuals out there who deserve [the medal] just as well,"" Seif said last Friday. ""But it’s an honor to accept it on the behalf of the unit and on behalf of the rest of the men.""

The bomb-maker they were after was responsible for the deaths of a number of coalition troops and an expert at manufacturing roadside bombs. Seif and Hansen found themselves outside his compound cutting off a back escape route when they came under fire. Hansen was wounded badly and Seif rushed to his aide.

“Even though Justin was hit, he was very much still in the game,” Seif said. “He motioned to where the [shooter] was, so I assaulted through.”

Seif was credited with rushing forward without backup and clearing the compound by himself, a daunting task for any operator. He then returned to Hansen to treat his wounds. Hansen later died.

Maj. Gen. Joseph L. Osterman, head of the Marine Special Operations Command, presented the medal to Seif.

“The fact that [Seif] continued to fight through the objective to get Sgt. Hansen taken care of, putting himself in the line of fire, speaks volumes to who he is and demonstrates that he would never leave a Marine behind,” Osterman said.

Seif leaves behind his wife, Dawn, pictured alongside him here at the 2013 USO Gala in Washington D.C."
1GnQDgW,2015-03-11 00:00:00,Why Some Think 47 GOP Senators Broke the Law With Iran Letter - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/47-gop-senators-broke-law-iran-letter/story?id=29528727,"Some law professors and liberal commentators say they believe the “open letter” Sen. Tom Cotton and 46 of his Republican colleagues sent this week to the leaders of Iran, warning them that any nuclear deal they sign with President Obama won’t last after Obama leaves office, might be a crime.

That letter from the Arkansas Republican to the ayatollahs and other Iranian officials, critics say, is a violation of the 1799 Logan Act, which says starkly:

“This [letter] seems squarely to satisfy the elements of the law,” Temple University law professor Peter Spiro declared, suggesting a crime has occurred here.

But hold on.

In the 215-plus years the Logan Act has been on the books, there’s only been one indictment against someone for breaking the law, in 1803, and the case fell apart before trial.

And what the GOP senators are doing here, while rare, is hardly unprecedented.

For instance, in 1920, 88 members of the House of Representatives sent a cable to British Prime Minister David Lloyd George and the British Parliament to protest against Britain’s treatment of Irish prisoners being held without arraignment or trial. This was directly contrary to the policy of President Woodrow Wilson, who sought closer relations with Great Britain at the time, and who did not support Ireland’s push for independence.

In 1927, the Senate’s anti-imperialist “peace progressives,” led by Sen. William Borah, R-Idaho), wrote directly to the Mexican president in an effort to renegotiate oil leases granted to U.S. oil companies under an agreement reached by President Coolidge.

In 1975, Sens. John Sparkman, D-Ala., and George McGovern, D-S.D., traveled to Cuba to negotiate directly with Fidel Castro about easing relations.

And the practice goes all the way back to the beginning of the country, when the House (dominated by fiery pro-French Jeffersonians) voted a resolution of approval of the radical French constitution of 1792, despite President George Washington’s desperate efforts to keep his fledgling country neutral in the great European wars that were unfolding.

The bottom line: As the great scholar Edward Corwin put it, “the Constitution … is an invitation to struggle for the privilege of directing American foreign policy.”

Cotton and his colleagues in Congress are waging that old struggle anew. Whether their “open letter” to the ayatollahs is wise is another matter.

(Cotton apparently fancies himself a constitutional scholar. In fact, he declares that the Iranian leadership “may not fully understand our constitutional system.” But his letter contains a pretty egregious constitutional error, one that would get him marked down sharply on a first-year con-law paper).

He writes that “the Senate must ratify [a treaty] by a two-thirds vote.”

But the Senate does not “ratify” anything. Ever. The Senate advises and consents to treaties and other international agreements, and the president, in the name of the United States, ratifies them as binding law on the country in its international relations.

This fact is not obscure. It is not hard to find. Indeed, a senator can find it on the Senate’s own webpage:

“The Senate does not ratify treaties. Instead, the Senate takes up a resolution of ratification, by which the Senate formally gives its advice and consent, empowering the president to proceed with ratification.”"

Oh, and a penchant for the written word.

Running a quaint New England Inn is the dream of many. But often, quaint comes with a steep price. Here's a chance to win an inn -- the Center Lovell Inn in Maine, about three hours north of Boston -- estimated to be worth 900k.

And all you have to do is write a short essay and with your submission, a $125 check.

The current innkeeper, Janice Sage, herself won the inn in an essay contest 22 years ago, according to The Boston Globe. But after 17-hour days, $500,000 in renovations and serving up to 120 dinners a night in the inn's restaurant, Sage is ready to move on.

The inn reportedly comes with all the furnishings, but no food or alcohol. And the person who wins the contest must agree to ""maintain the property as a country inn and restaurant for at least one year after the hand-over, keep the building painted white, and maintain the roofing and shutters in forest green, hunter green, or black.""

Sage expects about 7,500 entries. That would come to almost $940,000 for Sage to enjoy her retirement.

She will read all the entries on the subject: ""Why I would like to own and operate a country inn,"" by May 17, the Globe reported.

She'll choose her top 20 and then hand those over to two unnamed area judges who will pick the winner. The transfer is expected to be complete within 30 days."

The day that celebrates the mathematical constant pi is Saturday. And because it's 2015, this particular sequence of numbers in the calendar that matches pi -- 3/14/15 -- won't come around for another century.

While the mathematical constant, which represents the ratio of circumference of a circle divided by its diameter, is often abbreviated as 3.14 for convenience, pi actually has an infinite number of digits beyond the decimal point, starting with 3.141592653.

So, expect a good deal of celebration at 9:26 a.m. at 53 seconds -- with the pastry pie, for obvious phonetic and geometrical reasons.

In fact, there will be a point between 9:26 a.m. 53 seconds and 54 seconds that the clock matches the number pi down to an infinite number of digits.

And as befitting its reputation as an elite institution of math, science and engineering, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has announced that it will send out its acceptance letters for this year's incoming class on Pi Day, precisely at 9:26 a.m.

That should round out the day -- at least for those accepted."

Volo Auto Museum in Illinois is hosting the giveaway for the 1981 exhibition model estimated to be worth $85,000.

""The car is fully functional. It's a running and driving car,"" museum director Brian Grams told ABC News today. ""Though we don't guarantee time travel with the car, its flux capacitor and other board lights light up just like the movie's car.""

But, of course, you'll have to rely on the Cubs -- who famously haven't won a World Series since 1908 and haven't even appeared in one since 1945. They finished dead last in their division in 2014.

Some superstitious fans believe the team is cursed. The Cubs famously were five outs away from locking up a World Series berth in 2003 when a fan reached out and deflected a ball that appeared headed for a Cubs player's glove. The Cubs then blew a three-run lead to lose, lost another game after that and missed the World Series.

The DeLorean was acquired from a custom car builder who built various original car props for movies, including the original Batmobile for the T.V. series, Grams said. The car has been on display the museum since the late '90s.

The museum encourages Chicago Cubs and ""Back to the Future"" fans from all over the world to register beginning March 21, Grams said.

To enter the raffle, you can visit the museum with more than 400 eccentric cars in Volo, Illinois, and register on-site or online using your wristband ticket's number.

If the museum is too far for you to visit, just send it a self-addressed, stamped envelope, Grams said, and the museum will then mail you back an eligible registration number.

This is the museum's first car giveaway, Grams said. He said he hopes the Cubs finally win, so the car will go to a fan.

And if the Cubs drop the ball, there's a consolation prize, Grams said.

""We keep the car, but the giveaway winner will win the museum's hover board prop,"" he said."

At least eight people have died, according to the Vanuatu National Disaster Management Office, the director of UNICEF Australia, Tim O'Connor, told ABC News.

“We’re extremely concerned for [the] safety and well being of tens of thousands of people across Vanuatu,” the Australian Red Cross said in a statement. “Humanitarian needs will be enormous. Many people have lost their homes. Shelter, food and water [are] urgent priorities.”

The storm uprooted trees, blew roofs from homes and downed power lines across Port Vila. Chloe Morrison, a World Vision emergency communications officer who is in Port Vila, said there is no power or running water in the capital and that communication remains unreliable.

""It's still really quite dangerous outside. Most people are still hunkering down,"" she said. ""The damage is quite extensive in Port Vila but there are so many more vulnerable islands. I can't even imagine what it's like in those vulnerable communities.""

U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said the impact of the disaster wasn't yet clear, but he feared the damage and destruction could be widespread.

""We hope the loss of life will be minimal,"" he said during a World Conference on Disaster Risk and Reduction in Japan.

Ban said he had met the president of Vanuatu, Baldwin Lonsdale, who is attending the conference, and expressed the U.N.'s condolences and solidarity. The U.N. said it was preparing to deploy emergency rapid response units.

Located about a quarter of the way from Australia to Hawaii, Vanuatu has a population of 267,000 spread over 65 islands. About 47,000 people live in the capital.

Founded on March 3, 1915, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, called NACA, focused on innovation in aeronautics including the creation of the retractable landing gear, jet engine compressors and turbines, among other technologies.

The mission, according to NASA administrator Charles Bolden was to ""supervise and direct the scientific study of the problems of flight with a view to their practical solution.""

Starting with a small budget and no payroll, the committee grew into a powerhouse around World War II, developing cutting edge aeronautics technology that helped lead American troops to victory overseas.

It wasn't until the 1950s that the reality of space travel came into the picture. All 7,500 NACA employees became part of the newly formed National Aeronautics and Space Administration, or what we commonly call NASA.

The influence of NACA can be seen today in ""streamlined aircraft bodies, quieter jet engines, techniques for preventing icing, drag-reducing winglets and lightweight composite structures are an everyday part of flying thanks to research concepts and tools that trace their origins to the NACA,"" Bolden said in a statement celebrating the milestone anniversary.

NACA's place in history is also cemented by a set of footprints left behind on the moon. Before NASA was formed, the first man to set foot on the moon, Neil Armstrong, was a NACA employee.

According to a law enforcement official, the report will say the Ferguson Police Department’s conduct routinely violated the constitution and federal law due to a combination of racial bias and a focus on generating revenue.

According to the findings, African-Americans make up 67 percent of the population of Ferguson, but were subject to 85 percent of traffic stops, 90 percent of citations and 93 percent of arrests.

In essence they accuse the Ferguson police department of a pattern and practice of discrimination.

The Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division found multiple examples of police and municipal court officials exhibiting racial bias in emails sent on official Ferguson accounts.

Examples include a November 2008 email which stated that President Barack Obama would not be president for very long because “what black man holds a steady job for four years.” Another racist email from May 2011 stated: “An African-American woman in New Orleans was admitted into the hospital for a pregnancy termination. Two weeks later she received check for $5,000. She phoned the hospital to ask who it was from. The hospital said, ‘Crimestoppers.’”

From April to September 2014, 95 percent of people held at the Ferguson jail longer than two days were African American.

African Americans accounted for 95 percent of all “Manner of Walking in Roadway” -- essentially jaywalking -- charges, 94 percent of “failure to comply” charges and 92 percent of all “peace disturbance” charges."

Schock did not notify House Republican leaders prior to his decision to resign, catching the GOP leadership off-guard, according to a senior GOP leadership aide.

“With this decision, Rep. Schock has put the best interests of his constituents and the House first,"" House Speaker John Boehner wrote in a brief statement. ""I appreciate Aaron’s years of service, and I wish him well in the future.""

In Illinois, Republican Governor Bruce Rauner said it was ""a sad day for the people of Illinois and the 18th District"" in a statement after Schock's announcement.

Schock came under fire last month for his spending on office décor, which bore a striking resemblance to the one featured in the popular PBS British drama series, ""Downton Abbey,"" as well as eyebrow-raising travel spending.

He has hired a team of lawyers from the Washington, D.C., firm Jones Day, as well as communications operatives Ron Bonjean and Brian Walsh -- both veteran congressional aides -- to help him respond to his recent troubles.

The Office of Congressional Ethics had reportedly launched an investigation into Schock's spending habits, although that probe will end once Schock's resignation is official.

Schock was already under investigation by the House Ethics Committee for allegedly soliciting contributions for an independent expenditure-only political committee in excess of $5,000 per donor, in violation of federal law, House rules, and standards of conduct. That investigation will also end on March 31st once the resignation takes effect, although Schock could still potentially face a criminal inquiry.

A Schock spokesperson confirms that Schock has repaid all money he’s received during his congressional career from expensing mileage.

“In an effort to remove any questions and out of an abundance of caution, Congressman Schock has reimbursed all monies received for official mileage since his election to Congress,” a Schock aide wrote in an email."
1GTBJQu,2015-03-05 00:00:00,Ferguson Report: Rampant Racism and Other Scathing Findings From Probe - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/ferguson-report-rampant-racism-scathing-findings-probe/story?id=29385473,"The Department of Justice today released its investigation of the Ferguson police, which found a pattern and practice of discriminatory policing.

The report includes seven racist emails sent by Ferguson officers. In its review, the Justice Department also found 161 use of force complaints against the Ferguson police from 2010 to 2014. Only one case was founded and no officer was disciplined.

The conclusions come nearly seven months after a confrontation with officer Darren Wilson left 18-year-old Michael Brown dead.

In the wake of the controversial slaying of unarmed teenager Trayvon Martin, Brown’s death reignited a national debate over race in America and sparked protests across the country. Separately today, the DOJ announced that Wilson will not be charged in Brown's death.

Here is a sampling of some of the 100-page report's most scathing findings:

The investigation has found that the Ferguson police department “routinely” stopped African American drivers without reasonable suspicion, arrested them without probable cause, and used unreasonable force against them. The police actions, the investigation found, were “unconstitutional,” and amounted to a “pattern and practice” of unlawful conduct.

""Conducting stops without reasonable suspicion and arrests without probable cause"" -- both violations of the Fourth Amendment, according to the DOJ.

The report found that racial bias and a desire to generate revenue drove much of the law enforcement efforts in Ferguson. African Americans accounted for 85 percent of the vehicle stops, 90 percent of the citations, and 93 percent of the arrests, despite making up only 67 percent of the population. “African Americans are more than twice as likely as white drivers to be searched during vehicle stops,” the report found, “but are found in possession of contraband 26 percent less often than white drivers.”

Harmful municipal court and police practices are due, at least in part, to intentional discrimination as ""demonstrated by direct evidence of racial bias and stereotyping about African Americans by certain Ferguson police and municipal court officials,"" according to the DOJ.

When it comes to use of force by the police, the report found that nearly 90 percent of the documented force cases involved African Americans. Senior DOJ officials said that they found 161 excessive force cases filed against the police from 2010 to 2014, but only one had been “founded.” No officers were disciplined for excessive force in that time period. And, in every canine bite incident for which racial information is available, the investigation found, the person bitten was an African- American.

The Department of Justice has recommended 26 steps the city should take to start correcting these longstanding issues. Among them:

At a briefing about the results of the investigation, top DOJ officials – who asked not be named – said that some of the recommendations are already being implemented, and they believed Ferguson officials had to ability to change. If the city does not make the recommended changes, these officials said that the Justice Department would not hesitate to file suit against the city.

The Ferguson Police Department did not return a call seeking comment. In a news conference late today, Ferguson Mayor James Knowles said the city has cooperated with the DOJ, received the results of the investigation and has already acted on changes, including diversity training for police and African-American hires. The city immediately placed three employees who allegedly sent racially-charged emails on administrative leave. One of the three has been fired and the fate of the others awaits the results of an internal investigation. ""That type of behavior will not be tolerated,"" Knowles said. ""We must do better not only as a city but as a state and country.""

1GTD1Lg,2015-03-05 00:00:00,K-Cup Inventor John Sylvan Admits He Doesn't Use 'Expensive' Coffee Pods - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Business/cup-inventor-john-sylvan-admits-expensive-coffee-pods/story?id=29382481,"John Sylvan, the inventor of K-Cups, admits he doesn't use his hugely popular product and laments their impact on the environment.

Sylvan not only complains that K-Cups, which are found in many households and offices around the country, contribute to waste, but that they're expensive, too.

“I feel bad sometimes that I ever did it,"" Sylvan told The Atlantic.

“I don't have one. They're kind of expensive to use,” Sylvan said about the coffee pods experience. “Plus it’s not like drip coffee is tough to make.”

Sylvan did not respond to a request for comment from ABC News.

In the article, Monique Oxender, the chief sustainability officer for Keurig Green Mountain, said the pods are ""fully recyclable"" if a person is willing to disassemble them into paper, plastic and metal parts.

“I gotta be honest with you,” Oxender said, “we're not happy with where we are either. We have to get a solution, and we have to get it in place quickly.”

But Sylvan counters that the type of plastic creates a recycling challenge.

“No matter what they say about recycling, those things will never be recyclable,” Sylvan said. “The plastic is a specialized plastic made of four different layers.""

Sylvan said he has proposed a solution that's so far fallen on deaf ears.

""Take coffee and put it in a centrifuge, and it comes apart. Then you take the parts and combine them back when you make the coffee. So you could use something like a ketchup foil pack, and the separate parts won't become oxidized when they’re stored and transported. Then you can combine them again at the last minute while making the coffee,” he told The Atlantic.

A spokeswoman for Keurig said the recyclability of K-cup packs “is a challenge we take very seriously.”

“[Sylvan’s] contributions to the company were made in its infancy 19 years ago and Keurig Green Mountain is a fundamentally different company today, in which we partner with the world’s leading brands and are committed to sustainability,” a statement from the company read.

Keurig said it is working toward making all of its K-Cup packs recyclable by 2020, in addition to other environmental goals like limiting water use, according to the company’s sustainability report released last month. Keurig says the majority of pack types for the Keurig 2.0 system will be recyclable by mid-March. The company’s other goals include achieving “zero waste-to-landfill” at its manufacturing and distribution facilities.

The company says it has also studied packaging for its Keurig 2.0 brewers to avoid using 16 million cubic feet of EPS foam each year, enough to fill a football field to a depth of 283 feet.

The company said it supports more effective municipal recycling and has joined other companies in the Closed Loop Fund to make recycling available to all Americans."
1GThwNj,2015-03-16 00:00:00,Robert Durst Says on HBO 'What the Hell Did I Do? Killed Them All' - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/US/robert-durst-hbo-hell-killed/story?id=29650536,"Robert Durst, the subject of both an HBO series and law enforcement scrutiny, asked himself off-camera in the closing moments of the final episode of the documentary that aired Sunday, “What the hell did I do?” before answering, “Killed them all, of course.”

Filmmakers asked Durst about similarities in handwriting in a letter he wrote and another linked to one of the killings to which he has been linked, The Associated Press reported, before he wore his microphone into the bathroom.

That’s when he apparently said to himself, ""There it is. You're caught"" and ""What the hell did I do? Killed them all, of course.""

The six-part HBO series ""The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst"" ended a day after Durst was arrested on a capital murder warrant issued by police in Los Angeles related to the death of his friend, Susan Berman, his attorney said today.

FBI agents believed Durst may have wanted to flee the country, possibly to Cuba, as he registered under an alias at the hotel, paid with cash, and was found with fake documents, said the source. According to nola.com, Saturday marked the first nonstop flight from New Orleans to Cuba since 1958.

The Los Angeles Police Department said today Berman's death has been under investigation since her body was found in her home on Christmas Eve in 2000.

""As a result of investigative leads and additional evidence that has come to light in the past year, investigators have identified Robert Durst as the person responsible for Ms. Berman's death,"" the LAPD said.

Durst appeared before a magistrate Sunday in New Orleans where he was ordered held without bond, according to the Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office. He has an extradition hearing scheduled for Monday.

""We will waive extradition in an attempt to expedite the process of getting into court in LA to answer and defend against the charges,"" Chip Lewis, Robert Durst’s attorney, told ABC News in a statement.

Durst's brother Douglas Durst said in a statement, ""We are relieved and also grateful to everyone who assisted in the arrest of Robert Durst. We hope he will finally be held accountable for all he has done.""

HBO said in a statement, ""We simply cannot say enough about the brilliant job that Andrew Jarecki and Marc Smerling did in producing The Jinx. Years in the making, their thorough research and dogged reporting reignited interest in Robert Durst's story with the public and law enforcement.""

The New York real estate heir has made national headlines as a person of interest or suspect in three deaths since 1982.

Durst has denied killing Berman, but some believed he had a motive, allegedly wanting to silence her about the 1982 disappearance of his first wife, Kathleen Durst, another death he has been investigated for but never charged. Berman was about to meet with investigators in New York about the disappearance of Kathleen Durst before she died.

Kathleen was officially declared dead in 2001, and Durst has said he has no idea what happened to her.

Durst was also charged in the 2001 killing of a neighbor in Galveston, Texas, but he claimed self-defense and was later found not guilty.

Durst, who participated in 25 hours of interviews for the HBO series, declined to comment to ABC News about the series.

1GTKTPJ,2015-03-16 00:00:00,Baby Beer Bottles and 4 More Questionable Children's Toys - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/baby-beer-bottles-questionable-childrens-toys/story?id=29446162,"Watching a baby throw back his head to take a long sip from his bottle is a common adorable sight for parents. But what if the bottle is tinted brown with a tin top and labeled ""lager""? Still cute?

Fred And Friends, the manufacturers of a prank baby bottle called ""Chill Baby, Li'l Lager Baby Bottle"" apparently think the idea is hilarious. They are selling pre-orders of the 8-inch item for $12 on the company's website, noting that the bottle is ""BPA-free, phthalate-free plastic bottle with a food-grade silicone nipple. Cheers!""

Fred and Friends did not respond to ABC News' requests for comment on the product, and whether the company has any concerns about the Li'l Lager Baby Bottle encouraging children to consume alcohol.

Is it hilarious or ill-conceived? Here, four more unconventional toys that some find questionable and others think are quite funny.

Roadkill Toys' Smudge The Squirrel

""He measures a statuesque 32 cms from twitchy nose to bushy tail, and 10 cms from squished flank to flank,"" the display copy begins describing Roadkill Toys' Smudge The Squirrel, a plush doll designed to resemble a rodent that has recently been run over by a car. For $26.28 on Amazon, the toy includes multicolor entrails that can be pulled out from a zipper pouch, as well as a body bag and death certificate.

But while the ""manufacturer recommended age"" on the Amazon product page is ""4 years and up,"" creator Adam Arber told ABC News that the toy is intended for an older audience.

""It isn't designed and marketed for children,"" Arber said, noting that, ""it's a grown-up toy for collectors and students."" But, he added, ""It's in a similar vein to Tom and Jerry and Itchy and Scratchy humor. It's cartoon humor, and parents don't usually get upset with those programs.""

He admitted that not everyone was a fan.

""Sometimes we do get detractors and people who just don't understand humor,"" said Arber. ""These people are generally fundamentalist Christians or animal welfare activists. PETA rang me up once and said that they've bought all the toys and have some on display in their headquarters.""

Archie McPhee's The Avenging Narwhal

""The narwhal is an arctic-dwelling whale, who, thanks to his long, pointy tusk, has been nicknamed 'the Unicorn of the Sea,'"" notes the introductory copy on The Avenging Narwhal's product description. ""Our Avenging Narwhal is made of hard vinyl and comes with a detachable tusk to impale a devious penguin (included).""

Sold for $7.50 on the Archie McPhee's site, the hard plastic toy is considered unsafe for children 3 and under due to small parts that could present a choking hazard. But despite a tongue-in-cheek fictional origin story detailing why the narwhal seeks revenge, there is no warning that the toy might be considered violent to those 4 years old and up.

Whether it is or isn't is a matter of personal taste, though narwhals feed on fish, not penguins. McPhee's did not respond to ABC News' requests for comment.

I Heart Guts' Tremendous Testicle Plush

Puns abound in the affectionate product description for this 9"" x 9"" x 5"" plush doll created to resemble a large blue testicle with a smiley face, leading one to believe that the item may be geared toward adults. But the copy does note that the $20 doll is safe for all ages. Do kids really want to play with this?"

""In one afternoon 50 years ago, so much of our turbulent history -- the stain of slavery and anguish of civil war; the yoke of segregation and tyranny of Jim Crow; the death of four little girls in Birmingham, and the dream of a Baptist preacher -- met on this bridge,"" Obama said, addressing a crowd gathered there.

""It was not a clash of armies, but a clash of wills; a contest to determine the meaning of America,"" the president said.

While praising the accomplishments of the marchers at Selma and across the country in the civil rights movement, he also reminded his listeners that the work is not finished.

""We just need to open our eyes, and ears, and hearts, to know that this nation's racial history still casts its long shadow upon us,"" he said. ""We know the march is not yet over, the race is not yet won, and that reaching that blessed destination where we are judged, all of us, by the content of our character -- requires admitting as much, facing up to the truth.""

Touching on the Justice Department's recent report finding rampant racism on the Ferguson, Mo., police department and a municipal government that used its police force to raise revenue, Obama said those findings were reminiscent of America before the late 1960s.

""The report's narrative was sadly familiar,"" Obama said. ""It evoked the kind of abuse and disregard for citizens that spawned the Civil Rights Movement.""

Despite the problems revealed in Ferguson, the president urged anyone listening not to forget the progress that's been made.

""We do a disservice to the cause of justice by intimating that bias and discrimination are immutable, or that racial division is inherent to America. If you think nothing's changed in the past fifty years, ask somebody who lived through the Selma or Chicago or Los Angeles of the 1950s,"" Obama said.

Obama appeared at the same bridge in Selma, Ala., addressing a crowd gathered there for a day of events marking the 50th anniversary of the Selma to Montgomery marches. He was introduced by John Lewis, the civil rights leader who now serves as a Democratic member of Congress.

""I would've told you you're crazy,"" Lewis said, if anyone had told him 50 years ago that he would return to Selma to introduce the first African-American president."

""We got Leah's MIBG Scans back tonight and the doctors told us they didn't see any active disease in her body!!!,"" her dad wrote on Instagram.

""We still have to wait for her MRI and bone biopsy results later this week. But the doctors feel very optimistic about them because of the results from today. So for now we celebrate!!"" he wrote.

Leah underwent surgery and chemotherapy after doctors found a cancerous growth in her abdomen in June, according to The Associated Press.

Still had earlier announced on his Instagram account that Leah's battle with cancer was not yet over. But this is certainly a step in the right direction.

Still, 25, a defensive tackle, had originally been cut from the Bengals roster, but once the team learned his daughter had stage 4 cancer, they resigned him to their practice squad. He has since been placed on the active roster."

“It is appalling that elephants and many others may be extinct in the wild in our lifetimes, and that we seem to be hurtling towards that tragic outcome,” the prince said in a speech.

The sanctuary is located in Xishuangbanna, a fast-developing area in southwestern China, where elephants are part of the culture. Just a few miles from the sanctuary is a local circus, where patrons line up to ride and get picked up by elephants that have had their tusks either cut or removed for safety."

The documentary crew spent hours interviewing Robert Durst, who had faced decades of law enforcement scrutiny involving three deaths.

The small crew didn’t have a chance to pour through every audio and video clip, Jarecki said. When extra editors were added, one of the editors was tasked with double-checking the material.

That something turned out to be Durst, apparently saying to himself, ""There it is. You're caught"" and ""What the hell did I do? Killed them all, of course."" The off-camera audio clip served as powerful closing moment to the HBO series ""The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst,"" which completed its sixth and final episode Sunday.

One day before the episode aired, Durst, 71, was arrested by FBI agents at a New Orleans hotel, in connection with a 2000 murder – one of three he has been suspected of since the 1980s. Durst is scheduled to appear in court today for an extradition hearing.

Jarecki said he was shocked to hear the audio for the first time.

""I sat there in the edit room with my partners, [Marc Smerling and Zac Stuart-Pontier], and we just sort of shook our heads and it took a while to really understand the impact of it. It was so chilling to hear it. It’s disturbing to hear it. It makes you very uncomfortable to hear it,” he said.

The audio was recorded three years ago, Jarecki said. The clip came from the group’s second and final interview of Durst. Jarecki said the documentary producers discussed what to do with the clip.

“We talked a lot about it with our legal advisors and we said, ‘Look, if we go to the authorities now, we’re missing the opportunity for us to actually get the real story from him, and it may take years for them to do that because the truth is, as filmmakers, we have the freedom to do things that maybe the law enforcement authorities wouldn’t have,” Jarecki said. “But at the same time, we didn’t want to hold it back if it was going to take forever. So all we could do was get him into the chair, which took a lot of work, and then, when we had his reaction, that was when we felt the time was right for us to show that to them and that was many, many months ago.

“We’ve been in contact with law enforcement for the past two years, so when we finally found that subsequent submission, what happens in the bathroom, we contacted them and we said, ‘We have something more.’”

Jarecki said the filmmakers did not make a deal with law enforcement over the timing of the arrest.

“We don’t have that kind of power, we’re not in charge of the arrest timing, and we had no idea of the arrest timing,” he said.

The Los Angeles Police Department said the death of Susan Berman has been under investigation since her body was found in her home on Christmas Eve in 2000.

""As a result of investigative leads and additional evidence that has come to light in the past year, investigators have identified Robert Durst as the person responsible for Ms. Berman's death,"" the LAPD said.

1GUUAKK,2015-03-04 00:00:00,What You Need to Know About the Challenge to Obamacare in Supreme Court - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/obamacare-subsidies-supreme-court-hears-major-challenge/story?id=29351654,"The Affordable Care Act, a.k.a. Obamacare, dodged a bullet in 2012 when the Supreme Court upheld the individual mandate. Wednesday, it faces a second major legal challenge; this one to the taxpayer-funded premium subsidies that underpin the entire law.

The nine justices will hear arguments over whether it’s legal to give out the subsidies in 34 states where the federal government established and runs the insurance exchanges, HealthCare.gov.

The stakes are high: About 7.5 million Americans have received subsidies to purchase health insurance coverage in those 34 states.

If the court strikes them down, the “vast majority” will be forced out of coverage almost immediately because their premiums will become prohibitively expensive, experts say.

""There could be chaos,"" said Abbe Gluck, a Yale Law School professor who specializes in health law.

An average American receiving Obamacare subsidies pays just $105 a month out of pocket for insurance, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Take away the aid and the cost spikes to $373 a month – for many, a price out of reach.

“The horror stories will be real,” Republican Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska warned in the Wall Street Journal. “Chemotherapy turned off for perhaps 12,000 people, dialysis going dark for 10,000.”

Experts are also sounding alarm bells about a broader impact: the upending of individual insurance markets and a likely “death spiral.” Premiums would skyrocket for everyone in those 34 states, not just those who purchased Obamacare, a study in the New England Journal of Medicine found.

And if you think the states, Congress or the Department of Health and Human Services could enact a quick, even temporary, fix, then think again. There has been little-to-no preparation for a court decision striking the subsidies down.

“We’ll have to wait and see what the Supreme Court decides,” President Obama told Reuters Monday. “If they rule against us, we’ll have to take a look at what our options are.”

There will be just 25 days to look at those options after the court releases its opinion, which is expected in June, leaving precious little time for lawmakers and those relying on subsidized Obamacare insurance to act to come up with an alternative plan."
1GvLdjV,2015-03-13 00:00:00,Ferguson: Demonstrators Gather Outside Police Department Night After Shooting - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/US/ferguson-shooting-police-officers-released-hospital/story?id=29573803,"A manhunt for suspects in the ambush shootings of two police officers in Ferguson, Missouri, continued tonight as demonstrators gathered outside the headquarters of the city's police department for a candlelight vigil.

More than 100 demonstrators gathered, along with media and police presence, but the tone was much different than a night before, when a large crowd gathered following the resignation of the St. Louis suburb's police chief. It was during that gathering that shots rang out and the two officers were injured.

The officers were released from the hospital Thursday morning after sustaining non-threatening injuries, the St. Louis County Police said in a Facebook post. St. Louis County Police and the Missouri State Highway Patrol have taken over security for the protests in Ferguson since the shooting.

The officers, who have not been identified, were ""lucky"" they weren't killed, St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said earlier Thursday. He said they heard ""hear three or four shots ring out"" before the officers were hurt, both of whom were seriously wounded from a shooter standing about 150 feet away.

""We are lucky by God's grace that we didn't lose two police officers,"" he said.

One officer, 41, was struck in the shoulder; the other, 32, in the face, Belmar said.

Belmar said the shots were fired from an undetermined location north or northwest of the Ferguson Police Department building.

The search for the suspect or suspects is the ""number one priority"" within the St. Louis County police department, according to Belmar.

President Obama called the shooting ""unacceptable.""

Violence against police is unacceptable. Our prayers are with the officers in MO. Path to justice is one all of us must travel together. –bo

U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, in a statement released this morning, said, ""This heinous assault on two brave law enforcement officers was inexcusable and repugnant. I condemn violence against any public safety officials in the strongest terms, and the Department of Justice will never accept any threats or violence directed at those who serve and protect our communities. ... Such senseless acts of violence threaten the very reforms that nonviolent protesters in Ferguson and around the country have been working towards for the past several months.""

Holder also said he wished the officers ""a full and speedy recovery.""

""We stand ready to offer any possible aid to an investigation into this incident, including the department's full range of investigative resources. And we will continue to stand unequivocally against all acts of violence against cops whenever and wherever they occur,"" he added.

Tensions simmered in the city on Wednesday night after the resignation of the city’s police chief, Tom Jackson. Hundreds of protesters gathered throughout the night, staring down police officers in riot gear.

A handful of people were arrested. Some people chanted, and other flare-ups were reported, unrest rekindled after a Justice Department report documented widespread racial bias in the city.

Jackson’s resignation makes him the sixth person who has been fired or forced to resign since the report was released March 4 detailing what it described as rampant racial bias in policing in the St. Louis suburb.

Lt. Col. Al Eickhoff will take over as the acting chief of police starting today as the city launches a national search for a new chief of police, the letter stated.

Jackson had initially come under fire in August for his department's handling of the shooting death of unarmed teenager Michael Brown.

Brown's parents released a statement today, calling the police shooting ""senseless.""

""We reject any kind of violence directed toward members of law enforcement. It cannot and will not be tolerated,"" the family said. ""We specifically denounce the actions of stand-alone agitators who unsuccessfully attempt to derail the otherwise peaceful and non-violent movement that has emerged throughout this nation to confront police brutality and to forward the cause of equality under the law for all. We must work together to bring peace to our communities. Our thoughts and prayers remain with the officers injured during this morning's shooting and their families.""

More than 100 demonstrators gathered, along with media and police presence, but the tone was much different than a night before, when a large crowd gathered following the resignation of the St. Louis suburb's police chief. It was during that gathering that shots rang out and the two officers were injured.

The officers were released from the hospital Thursday morning after sustaining non-threatening injuries, the St. Louis County Police said in a Facebook post. St. Louis County Police and the Missouri State Highway Patrol have taken over security for the protests in Ferguson since the shooting.

The officers, who have not been identified, were ""lucky"" they weren't killed, St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said earlier Thursday. He said they heard ""hear three or four shots ring out"" before the officers were hurt, both of whom were seriously wounded from a shooter standing about 150 feet away.

1GXgHj3,2015-03-18 00:00:00,SXSW 2015: 5 Standout Moments in Technology - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/sxsw-2015-standout-moments-technology/story?id=29722900,"After five days of fun, the interactive portion of South by Southwest has come to an end.

As the barbecue and beer bender winds down for techies at SXSW, here's a look back at five standout and downright cool moments from the interactive portion of this year's festival in Austin, Texas.

Google's Biggest Mistake With Glass

Astro Teller, the scientist who has the real-life title of ""Captain of Moonshots"" at the secretive Google X laboratory, was candid in a keynote address on Tuesday about what went wrong with Google Glass.

""We allowed and sometimes even encouraged too much attention for the program,"" Teller said. ""What we wanted was to say to the world this is an early prototype.""

Launching the Google Glass Explorer program to get the devices out into the real world for immediate feedback was an important first step for Teller's team.

""We learned a lot on the technology front,"" he said. ""Many things like the battery were big obstacles. [Also] to understand how to talk about these things in the real world and figure out how new social norms could be built.""

Google ended its Explorer program earlier this year and is back at it working on a second prototype.

Flying Car

Flying cars could one day be a reality. AeroMobil showed off its prototype, which the company hopes will be hitting the road and the skies as early as 2017.

The vehicle -- which looks a lot like something the Jetsons would have -- tops off at 99 mph on the road and around 124 mph in the sky, according to the AeroMobil website.

Not surprisingly, the vehicle won't come cheap. While an exact price hasn't been set, the company said buyers can expect to pay somewhere in the six figures for the first edition.

'Ex Machina'

""Ex Machina"" was the film everyone was talking about at SXSW, thanks in part to a brilliant stunt involving Tinder.

Alicia Vikander, an actress who plays a beautiful robot in the film, was turned into a Tinder bot at the start of the festival where plenty of unsuspecting men swiped right on the actress.

After having a conversation with the bot, they were directed to her Instagram where the only two posts are advertisements for the film.

The stunt drew plenty of attention to the film, which stars Oscar Isaac and opens on April 10.

Meerkat

Two weeks after its launch, the live video streaming app took SXSW by storm as festival attendees used it to broadcast their experiences from Austin live to their Twitter followers.

What makes Meerkat so attractive is the easy way users can leverage their existing social networks with just a smartphone.

After downloading the app and logging in via Twitter, users can schedule a live stream or begin one with the push of a button. A tweet is then sent out from the user's account, inviting people to click the link to watch the live stream.

When the person is done broadcasting, the users can save their stream or choose for it to disappear -- offering the same ephemeral content that has turned Snapchat into a success."
1GxhlDY,2015-03-12 00:00:00,"Homeopathy Doesn't Work, Major Australian Study Concludes - ABC News",http://abcnews.go.com/Health/homeopathy-work-major-australian-study-concludes/story?id=29595411,"Homeopathic medicine doesn't work, according to a major Australian study.

The country's National Health and Medical Research Council considered 1,800 studies, narrowing them down to 225 that met certain criteria, and concluded that homeopathy didn't work better than a placebo. Even if a study claimed it was effective, the council found that that study was of poor quality.

""From this review, the main recommendation for Australians is that they should not rely on homeopathy as a substitute for proven, effective treatments,"" said the council's CEO, professor Warwick Anderson.

""This statement was the result of a rigorous examination of the evidence and used internationally accepted methods for assessing the quality and reliability of evidence for determining whether or not a therapy is effective for treating health conditions,"" Anderson added.

In 2007, Americans spent $2.9 billion on over-the-counter homeopathic medicines and $170 million on visits to homeopathic practitioners, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The new Australian study doesn't bode well for ""treatments"" such as dilute pellets, gels, creams and other substances derived from things like crushed whole bees and poison ivy.

""Do not use homeopathy as a replacement for proven conventional care or to postpone seeing a health care provider about a medical problem,"" the CDC says on its website."

The attacks happened in the country's capital of Sana'a, authorities said.

A total of 120 people were killed and 150 were injured, according to the Ministry of Information in Yemen.

Two high-ranking figures were among those killed: a major Shia religious leader and the imam of one of the mosques, according to a Yemeni official.

ISIS claimed responsibility for the attacks, according to the SITE Intelligence Group, which tracks international terrorists and the global jihadist network.

Four suicide bombers attacked ""two Houthis dens"" in Sanaa, according to a statement from the Sana'a province media office, while a fifth attacked another ""den"" in Saada.

The mosques targeted are used mainly by supporters of the Zaidi Shia-led Houthi rebel movement which controls the capital, the BBC reports.

The video, which surfaced over the weekend, was posted to Twitter by Unheard, which describes itself as ""an alliance of black students organized for change within campus administration and atmosphere."" The video shows young men on a bus chanting, ""There will never be a n----r at SAE.""

The tweet, directed at OU president David Boren, said, ""Racism is alive at The University of Oklahoma.""

Boren said at a news conference Monday that he was ""sickened by the video,"" and, ""I couldn't sleep after that.""

And the Tri Delta sorority announced that it is investigating the incident. In the video, Tri Delta members are seen singing with SAE members on the charter bus.

""We are deeply disappointed by the conduct of the students involved in the incident at The University of Oklahoma,"" the national Tri Delta sorority said in a statement. ""Tri Delta expects its members to uphold the highest responsibilities of college women. The behavior documented in the video is deplorable and is in no way consistent with Tri Delta's ideals and core values. We are cooperating fully with our partners at the university as they investigate this matter.""

The sorority later issued a followup statement, saying, ""Members of the chapter were not pictured in the video and have not been and are not currently the subject of any investigation. We will continue to cooperate fully with our partners at the university.""

Boren said in an earlier written statement that all ties and affiliations between the school and the SAE chapter are ""hereby severed.""

""To those who have misused their free speech in such a reprehensible way, I have a message for you. You are disgraceful,"" Boren's statement read. ""You have violated all that we stand for. You should not have the privilege of calling yourselves 'Sooners.' Real Sooners are not racist. Real Sooners are not bigots. Real Sooners believe in equal opportunity. Real Sooners treat all people with respect. Real Sooners love each other and take care of each other like family members.

""All of us will redouble our efforts to create the strongest sense of family and community,"" Boren added. ""We vow that we will be an example to the entire country of how to deal with this issue. There must be zero tolerance for racism everywhere in our nation.""

Boren said SAE residents would have to remove their possessions and vacate the house ""by midnight tomorrow.""

At Monday’s news conference, Boren added that he doesn't plan on helping the displaced residents find housing.

""That's not our responsibility,"" he said. ""We don't provide student services to bigots.""

In fact, he said he'd be happy if the ""bus-load"" of students involved left school, adding that the university's legal team is exploring possible further punishment up to and including expulsion.

""As they pack their bags, I hope they think long and hard about what they've done,"" Boren said.

Boren called the video ""heartbreaking for every member of this community.""

The national SAE organization said in its own statement that it closed the Oklahoma Kappa chapter at the University of Oklahoma and suspended all of the fraternity's members -- and the members involved with the incident could have their membership privileges revoked permanently.

""We apologize for the unacceptable and racist behavior of the individuals in the video, and we are disgusted that any member would act in such a way,"" the online statement read. ""Furthermore, we are embarrassed by this video and offer our empathy not only to anyone outside the organization who is offended but also to our brothers who come from a wide range of backgrounds, cultures and ethnicities."""
1GyKp1j,2015-03-09 00:00:00,"Sam Simon, 'Simpsons' Co-Creator, Dead at 59 - ABC News",http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/sam-simon-simpsons-creator-dead-59/story?id=29508699,"Sam Simon, co-creator of ""The Simpsons,"" died Sunday after a long battle with colon cancer, his foundation confirmed via Facebook today. He was 59.

""It is with much sadness that we must let you know that Sam Simon has passed over,"" the message read. ""We all miss him, and in his honor, we will continue bringing his vision to light through our work at The Sam Simon Foundation. We take comfort in knowing how many greetings he is receiving across that Rainbow Bridge. We love you Sam!""

Another Facebook page for his foundation added, ""He passed away peacefully in his own bed, in his own home, surrounded by people and a dog who loved him.""

The creative mind behind one of the longest, most successful shows in TV history had been vocal about his battle with the disease that eventually took his life. One of his last tweets was March 1 when he shared a picture of him at the doctor's getting his lungs drained.

Simon, who was a Los Angeles native, was diagnosed in 2012 and been given just months to live. In the three years he dealt with the disease, he kept his fans updated via social media and his pictures in the hospital were always candid and showed his humor in dealing with cancer.

No port. I'm getting old school. Iv. Nurse Julie is painless! pic.twitter.com/iB07w5p5pw

In an interview last year with Vanity Fair, Simon was open about giving his fortune - upwards of $100 million -- away to charities that were close to his heart, including animal rights. Simon was fiercely protective of all animals -- bears, chimps, dogs, dolphins and elephants. He also started a program called Feeding Families, which was a vegan food bank for 400 families in California.

Simon, who co-created ""The Simpsons"" with Matt Groening and James L. Brooks in the late 1980's, told the magazine how his obsession with helping other causes began.

""I'm an atheist, but there's a thing called tithing that a lot of religions do. Ten percent was the minimum you were supposed to give to charity every year. And I always outdid that,"" he said.

Carolyn Miles, president and CEO of Save the Children, said Simon supported the organization for decades.

""He gave a voice to children and endangered animals who can't speak up for themselves,"" Miles said. ""And he gave away his fortune so that they may have a chance at a better life.

""Sam once told me: 'Giving -- I get pleasure from it. I love it. I don't feel like it's an obligation. In fact, nothing is as gratifying as knowing that my giving has changed lives, especially the lives of children,'"" she said.

He was such a large donor to organizations like PETA that the organization named a headquarters after him.

After news of his death broke, PETA President Ingrid Newkirk told ABC News in a statement ""I think Sam died with a smile on his face, knowing that elephants were on their way out of the circus, something that, together with the closure of SeaWorld, he dreamt of and talked about all the time. He said the last two years of his life, since his diagnosis, were his happiest, as he used them to help animals who had nothing, and it gave him great joy to see chimpanzees, elephants, and even a ""gay"" bull find freedom from harm because he had worked with PETA to get them all out of hideous circumstances.""

It was his missions and causes that inspired Simon and kept him moving forward long past the date doctors assumed he would have passed."

The 24-year-old ""Harry Potter"" alum and U.N. women global goodwill ambassador made headlines last September when she launched the ""HeForShe"" campaign, which aims to enlist 1 billion men and boys in the movement for gender equality. After Watson delivered her speech, she said a new website popped up threatening to release naked pictures of her.

Watson said she knew the threat was empty, because she'd never taken any nude photos, but that didn't make it any less cruel.

""I knew it was a hoax. I knew the pictures didn't exist,"" she told an interviewer Sunday during a HeForShe webcast. ""But I think a lot of people that were close to me knew gender equality was an issue but they didn't really think it was that urgent or particularly, you know, 'We live in Great Britain. This is a thing of that past.' ... And then when they saw that the minute I stepped up and talked about women's rights, I was immediately threatened -- I mean, in less than 12 hours I was receiving threats -- and I think they were really shocked and, particularly, one of my brothers was very upset.""

Watson talked about the cruel prank while answering fans' questions for International Women's Day. The interview was later posted on her Facebook page, which has 30 million fans.

""So I think it was just a wake-up call of, 'Oh, this is like a real thing, it's really happening now. Like now,'"" she said. ""Women are receiving threats in all sorts of different forms. That was just one specific one.""

She added, ""If anything, it made me so much more determined. I was just raging. It made me so angry that I was just like ... 'This is why I have to be doing this!' ... So if anything, it actually, if they were trying to put me off it, they did the opposite.""

The letter returned a presumptive positive for cyanide, but it was being tested again to confirm the result, the Secret Service said tonight, confirming a story first reported by The Intercept.

The letter was received Monday at the White House Mail Screening Center, and after initial biological testing came up negative, chemical testing today came up with the positive for cyanide.

The sample was transported to another facility to confirm the results, the Secret Service said.

Sources familiar with the case say told ABC News the substance was inside a plastic Ziploc-like bag inside an envelope.

The sender is someone known to the Secret Service and charges are possible, depending whether the material was indeed hazardous, the sources said."

It was unclear how many people were inside the building when the fire occurred, according to the New York City Fire Department. The incident took place in a bustling area with many restaurants and pedestrians, blocks away from New York University.

""Preliminary evidence suggests a gas-related explosion,"" said New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, adding that the investigation is ongoing. He said the incident ""appears to have been caused by plumbing and gas work that occurred in 121 2nd Avenue.""

Four buildings were affected, including at least two that partially collapsed, said the mayor.

The four people in critical condition include two individuals with burns to their airways and another person who was unconscious following the event, according to FDNY Commissioner Daniel Nigro.

Of the about 250 firefighters who responded to the blaze, four were transported to area hospitals, where one was in fair condition, said the fire department. The conditions of the other firefighters weren't immediately released.

One man, Nicholas Figueroa, was unaccounted for after the fire, his father told ABC News. Nick Figueroa said his son went to lunch in a restaurant at the bottom of the building that caught fire and that a bank statement showed a charge from the eatery.

Figueroa said he has had no contact with his son since the explosion and that investigators began searching for him late Thursday.

Around 3:17 p.m., witnesses reported what sounded like an explosion at Sushi Park restaurant at 121 2nd Avenue, which is at the bottom of a five-story pre-war building that houses a handful of residential units. Had the event taken place during another time of the day, when more residents were in the building, it's likely more people could have been injured or missing.

""Our members arrived in less than three minutes to a scene they certainly didn’t expect -- to see that this explosion blew the front of 121 across the street,"" Nigro said. ""They, for the first 15 minutes, before the building started to collapse, made extremely dangerous searches of these buildings to search for any victims, and were forced out by the subsequent collapse of 123 and 121.""

The flames spread next door to 123 2nd Avenue, another five-story building anchored by the restaurant Pommes Frites on the street level. The other buildings that were affected were 119 2nd Avenue and 125 2nd Avenue, said the mayor.

""To the best of our knowledge they were working on the gas in the building. That was the work being done, and right now, the fire marshals and the police department are investigating with all of the people involved,"" Nigro said about the work that took place in one of the buildings by private contractors. ""I’m sure by the end of tonight, we’ll know a lot more.""

At 121 2nd Avenue, Con Edison said it was evaluating work by the building's plumber related to a gas service upgrade but the work failed its inspection ""for several reasons, including insufficient spacing for the installation of the meter in the basement.""

""We had no reports of gas odors in the area prior to the fire and explosion,"" read the statement from Con Edison. ""A survey conducted yesterday (Wednesday) of the gas mains on the block found no leaks. We continue to work with all agencies on the investigation into the cause, and we are praying for the recovery of all the injured.""

The Salvation Army set up a reception station at nearby Public School 63 to support residents of the buildings, family members and neighbors. The public can inquire about people who may be missing related to the incident through the phone number 311.

Almost exactly a year ago, another explosion rocked a separate neighborhood in New York City. That incident in East Harlem killed eight residents and injured dozens on the morning of March 12, 2014. The National Transportation Safety Board is still investigating what may have caused the explosion, which destroyed two five-story buildings. The NTSB released a report last week indicating that the Harlem explosion may have come from a new section of plastic pipe installed in 2011.

Witnesses said the street a scene of chaos when the explosion erupted as first responders rushed to the site. There were a series of earlier reports that indicated the firefighters might have been missing after the blast period, but all the first responders were located. At the same time, there was a frantic effort by the fire department to evacuate neighboring structures on a densely crowded block as the fire continued spreading.

1H0ypD9,2015-03-05 00:00:00,"Under Scrutiny, Hillary Clinton Asks for State Department Emails to be Released - ABC News",http://abcnews.go.com/US/hillary-clinton-responds-email-controversy/story?id=29401518,"Hillary Clinton on Wednesday asked the State Department to release the emails she sent from her personal account during her term as Secretary of State. But a State Department spokesperson told ABC News it will be ""several months"" before the emails are released, because the department will need time to review the emails and remove sensitive and personal information.

“I want the public to see my email. I asked State to release them. They said they will review them for release as soon as possible,” Clinton wrote on Twitter Wednesday night..

State Department deputy spokeswoman Marie Harf, in a statement that followed Clinton's tweet, said the department is focused on reviewing Clinton's emails.

""The State Department will review for public release the emails provided by Secretary Clinton to the Department, using a normal process that guides such releases,” the statement reads. “We will undertake this review as quickly as possible; given the sheer volume of the document set, this review will take some time to complete.”

Clinton’s team submitted 55,000 pages of emails to the State Department, but an unknown number of emails that do not pertain to work will not be turned over, a Clinton aide told ABC News.

The storage of Clinton’s email has come under scrutiny after a New York Times report revealed she used a personal, non-governmental email address to conduct official business as secretary of state. The Associated Press reported Tuesday Clinton used a personal server based in her New York home to host her emails.

Clinton, 67, used only one email address during her tenure, her attorney David Kendall wrote in an email to the House Select Committee, which is tasked with investigating the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi,Libya. The committee sent subpoenas to the State Department Wednesday requesting all of Clinton's communications related to Libya.

“The Select Committee on Benghazi today issued subpoenas for all communications of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton related to Libya and to the State Department for other individuals who have information pertinent to the investigation,” Jamal Ware, communications director for the committee, wrote in a statement. “The Committee also has issued preservation letters to internet firms informing them of their legal obligation to protect all relevant documents.”

The email account that Clinton used while working at the State Department was hdr22@clintonemail.com and was traced to a server based out of Chappaqua, New York, where she and former President Bill Clinton have a home, ABC News confirmed.

ABC News also learned that another email domain, wjcoffice.com, which used the former president's initials as their descriptor, was also based out of Chappaqua. That domain was registered by an individual called Eric Hoteham, the same name used to register the clintonemail.com domain.

Clinton has yet to explain why she used her own server and personal email, instead of a State Department email address to comply with federal record-keeping requirements.

Chris Kmetz of Bothell was driving home from his job as a Boeing analyst Feb. 23 when his car flipped into a drainage pond, putting the Superman fan on life support, his wife Jackie Kmetz told ABC News today.

Because she was warned her husband likely wouldn't make it, she mentioned to hospital staff early on her and Chris' wishes of donating his organs, she said.

She also dressed Chris in his “Superdad” T-shirt and had their kids wear their Superman shirts before saying goodbye Saturday, Jackie added.

""My husband was huge on Superman and comic superheroes, and he wore Superman shirts at least twice a week"" she said. ""Superman was his idol and the epitome of what he wanted to be: a humble hero whose purpose was to better the world around him.""

Chris kept over 10,000 comics in their bedroom, dressed as Superman every Halloween and would play superhero games with his kids, Jackie said, adding that you never would have known he was a former Marine because he was so goofy and happy-go-lucky.

""In true superhero fashion, Chris passed away, but he saved two lives after donating his kidneys,"" Jackie added.

Chris and Jackie competed in national autocross competitions through the Sports Car Club of America. Autocross racers drive through challenging courses designated by traffic cones at speeds no greater than legal highway driving, according to the SCCA.

""Organ donation was something Chris and I were really passionate about,"" Jackie said. ""When we first met when I was his car-racing teacher we both saw that we were donors on our licenses, had a whole conversation about it and clicked from there.""

The Kmetz family has received a ton of support from friends on Facebook, many of whom have changed their profile pictures to a white Superman logo with text saying, ""Be a superhero. Be like Chris Kmetz. Become a donor.""

The commemorative logo was also made into a sticker that the couple's circle of racing friends can put on their cars.

""I'll have the sticker on his blue race car, which I'm going to drive,"" Jackie said. ""It's going to be hard, that first race without him there, but I know he'd want me to keep doing it.""

Jackie said she hopes Chris' story will touch more lives and inspire more people to register to be organ donors because only relatively few organ donors can save lives because of rigid requirements such as the time that passes between a donor's death and the possible transplant.

Only an estimated 1 to 2 percent of organ donors die in a way that they can be an organ donor, United Network for Organ Sharing spokeswoman Anne Paschke told ABC News today.

Jackie said she wants Chris to know he continues to be a true superhero, and she's going to miss her best friend and sweet dad to their children."

In addition, two attackers have also been killed, Prime Minister Habib Essid said, calling it a ""cowardly terrorist operation"" that targeted tourists.

The tourists were attacked while they were getting off a bus to enter the museum, Essid said, noting this is the first attack there targeting tourists.

The attackers were wearing military fatigues, and when the tourists ran toward the museum to avoid the shooting, the attackers pursued them, Essid said.

Among the 17 tourists killed, the nationalities included Polish, German, Italian and Spanish, Essid said.

An additional 22 tourists and two Tunisians were injured, he said.

Radek Sikorski, speaker of Polish Parliament, said seven Polish tourists were dead and three were in in critical condition. And the Italian Foreign Ministry told ABC News that three Italians were dead and six were wounded.

The country's Interior Ministry initially said earlier today that eight people had been killed but also noted that a number of hostages were also being held captive in the museum and that security forces were deployed inside it.

Carina D. Klein, a spokesperson for the U.S. Embassy in Tunis, told ABC News they cannot confirm nor deny whether Americans are among the those dead in the attack.

At a news conference, the attorneys for the Brown family confirmed that the city of Ferguson and former police officer, Darren Wilson, would be named in the suit. They did not say when exactly the suit would be filed.

Brown was fatally shot by Wilson last August, sparking numerous protests in Ferguson.

""We believe that there were other alternatives available to him,"" Daryl Parks, attorney of Michael Brown's family, said of Wilson. ""He did not have to kill Michael Brown.""

The news comes a day after the Department of Justice announced they would not be prosecuting Wilson for Brown's death.

Attorney Anthony Gray, speaking on behalf of Brown's family, said they ""disagree with those findings.""

Michael Brown's parents, Lesley McSpadden and Michael Brown Sr. attended the news conference but did not speak to reporters.

Also this week, the Department of Justice also released a scathing report that found the Ferguson Police Department had a pattern and practice of discriminatory policing."

As is his annual custom, the president spent a portion of his afternoon on Tuesday with ESPN's Andy Katz, filling out a March Madness tournament bracket at the White House.

It's an annual opportunity for Obama to talk basketball and show off his knowledge of the college field. If George W. Bush won the presidency in 2000 because voters would rather sit with him for a beer, then Obama may owe part of his success to the apparent enjoyability of talking basketball with him.

The NCAA tournament is an unpredictable thing, and even the president is subject to its vagaries. Despite is widely recognized knowledge of the game, Obama has enjoyed (or not enjoyed) varying success since his first presidential bracket in 2009.

In that year, the president picked the University of North Carolina, a top-seeded team, to win the tournament--and he was right, despite missing three of that year's Final Four.

The president has only picked the NCAA's ultimate winner once, when he concurred with popular opinion and predicted North Carolina's widely anticipated championship run in 2009. This year, the president has once again picked the top teams to advance. His final four, as presented to Katz, are:

Kentucky (No. 1 seed)

Arizona (No. 2 seed)

Villanova (No.1 seed)

Duke (No. 1 seed)

After getting adventurous (for him, anyway) in '13 and '14, Obama's '15 NCAA picks are once again heavy on favorites pic.twitter.com/oRyXyKikXB

So what does this say about how Obama has changed over time? Should we ought to take his sports predictions as indications of his temperament?

Obama's 2015 bracket marks a return to his conservative style of NCAA picks. As usual, he has selected few upsets -- his notable exception being Buffalo, a 12-seed, to upset No. 5 West Virginia in the opening round -- and has placed three No. 1 seeds in his Final Four.

Obama loosened up a bit in 2013, picking No. 3 seed Florida for the Final Four. The president picked his riskiest bracket in 2014, predicting that No. 4 Louisville and Michigan State both reach the Final Four. Neither team made it, and those picks worked about as well for the president did during the 2014 midterms.

So after a brief flirtation with risky picks, Obama has reverted to his pragmatic style of selecting few upsets and predicting the top-ranked teams to make the Final Four.

Here's how the president's brackets have evolved over the years:

Obama's lone correct NCAA championship prediction came in 2009, when he picked a powerhouse UNC team to win it pic.twitter.com/jMEA2KAzDY

Cautious in 2010, Obama missed Butler's run to the title game vs. Duke, picking only 1 of 3 Final Four correct (KY) pic.twitter.com/08UNanoJYD

Obama picked ALL 1-seeds to the Final Four in 2011, a bad year to do so: VCU and Butler made deep runs to the FF pic.twitter.com/497KgJKZUd

It was 1s and 2s again for Obama in '12. Played it safe, just like he did by running against Romney's biz record. pic.twitter.com/y4ZUNVhp4M

Obama loosened up a bit in 2013, putting 3-seed Florida in the Final Four pic.twitter.com/Qom4We2fkU

His wildest bracket, 2014 saw Obama put two 4-seeds in the Final Four. Unfortunately, neither made it. pic.twitter.com/H36bOQiqgI"

The Brooklyn-based Preschool Mastermind, as it's called, is a preschool-type experience for adults. No, really. And according to its founder, there's show-and-tell, arts-and-crafts such as finger paint, games (think musical chairs) and even naps.

""I realized all the implications of what we learn in preschool,"" said founder Michelle Joni, who said she went to school for childhood education and always wanted to be a preschool teacher. ""People come here and get in touch with their inner child. It's magical.""

The class runs through March and meets weekly. Joni was getting ready for tonight's class when we spoke. She facilitates the class with two assistants. There are six students in the class, each hoping to get something different out of the experience.

""One person's here because they want to learn not to be so serious,"" she said. ""Another's here to learn to be more confident."" But some are there just to have fun.

Adult preschool -- not unlike New York City's preschool's for children, doesn't come cheap. Payment for the class is on a sliding scale ranging from $333 to $999. Joni said that ""preschool is all about choice. I want them [the students] to feel good about the choice they're making.""

Next week there's a field trip. Then the last week of class is ""parent day"" when the students bring two adults of their choice to class. One woman is actually bringing her parents.

Joni said that while the planned activities are fun, it's often the spontaneous moments that resonate with the students. ""It's the things you don't plan for, the sharing between friends and learning from and working off each other."""

Many owners across the country said it’s about time, and that “pot for pets” should be legal everywhere.

Becky Flowers, a California ranch owner, said she gave her mare Phoenix regular doses of medical marijuana for several years to help ease the pain of a degenerative joint condition. The horse could barely walk due to extreme swelling in her front legs that traditional and herbal medications didn’t seem to help, Flowers said.

“She would lay there for days and she wouldn’t eat or drink,” Flowers told ABC News.

Flowers said she considered having the animal euthanized but decided as a last ditch effort to give her some of marijuana legally prescribed to her husband who is a paraplegic. In less than an hour, the horse was up and moving, Flowers said.

Flowers began giving Phoenix about a tablespoon of medical marijuana in oil every day, she said, noting that the horse lived largely pain-free for two more years before dying in her late twenties. Since then, Flowers has given marijuana to some of her other horses and has recommended it to other horse owners as well.

Medical marijuana does show some promise for easing the pain and suffering in animals, but veterinarians and owners should proceed with caution, said Dr. Robert Silver, president of the veterinary botanical medical association.

“There needs to be a lot more research and education taking place before we introduce this to pets,” Silver said, who is a veterinarian in Colorado, a state where both medical and recreational marijuana are legal for people.

Studies show that dogs in particular react differently than humans to THC, one of marijuana’s active ingredients, Silver said. Because they have a high concentration of THC receptors in the back of their brains, they are susceptible to severe neurologic effects and toxic reactions, he added. States where medical or recreational use is legal have seen an increase in canine emergency room admissions associated with the drug, Silver said.

The American Veterinary Medical Association does not have an official stance on the use of medical marijuana with pets but suggests that vets make treatment decisions based on sound clinical judgment that stay in compliance with the law. They note that even in states where medical marijuana is legal, it is still a Class I narcotic under federal law which means vets are not legally allowed to prescribe it to their patients.

If passed, the Nevada law would allow animal owners to get marijuana for their pet if a veterinarian certifies the animal has an illness that might be helped by the drug. The proposal is in its earliest stages and faces numerous legislative hurdles before it could become law. It’s part of a larger bill that would refine the state’s existing medical marijuana law by clarifying penalties for drivers under the influence and allowing the resale of marijuana dispensaries.

The shooter, who has not been identified, is now in custody, according to police. The suspect was tased before he was arrested, Mesa police spokesman Esteban Flores said.

Flores said there are believed to be five or six different locations where the shooting took place.

Police said six people were shot, one of whom died at the scene.

Another victim remains in critical condition; four others are expected to survive, police said.

A Mesa police spokesman said that they believe the shooting spree began inside a room at a local motel, and that the suspect then shot one person at a nearby bistro before carjacking a vehicle and driving to an apartment complex.

The suspect then broke into an apartment in that complex, shooting one man, before fleeing to a neighboring apartment building and breaking into another apartment and shooting another individual, who is now in critical condition, police said.

""We don't know exactly what happened at the first shooting,"" a Mesa police official said. ""We know there was some type of argument and they possibly knew each other.""

Third-year student Martese Johnson was arrested by Alcoholic Beverage Control agents after he was rejected entry from a University Avenue bar, authorities said. The agents then approached Johnson and “a determination was made” to arrest him – during which time “the arrested individual sustained injuries,” according to the ABC agency, which is charged with enforcing alcohol laws in the state.

Cell phone video of the incident shows the student lying face down on the sidewalk with two agents detaining him as bystanders yell, “His head is bleeding!” From another angle, he is shown with his face bloodied, shouting, “I go to UVA!” and then “You f---ing racists!”

He was charged with public intoxication and obstruction of justice, ABC officials said in a statement. They would not comment on the case beyond details of the arrest. ""The individual received treatment for his injuries at a local hospital and was released,"" according to the statement.

University Vice President for Diversity and Equity Marcus L. Martin and Dean of African-American Affairs Maurice Apprey described the incident in a message to students and staff as “appalling” and said the student’s head was “slammed into the hard pavement with excessive force.”

“This was wrong and should not have occurred,” Martin and Apprey said in a written statement. “We view the nature of this assault as highly unusual and appalling based on the information we have received.""

The governor has asked the state police to begin an independent investigation into the incident.

Tonight, a large group of students gathered on campus at a rally in the wake of the incident, including Johnson.

Daniel Watkins, an attorney for Johnson, said in a statement that Charlottesville Police charged Johnson with two misdemeanors: obstruction of justice without force and profane swearing and/or intoxication in public. The student was released early this morning and has not yet entered a plea to the charges.

""Contrary to early police reports, Mr. Johnson has not been accused of possessing false identification.
Just before handcuffing him, police took Martese to the ground, striking his head on the pavement and causing him to bleed profusely from the gash on his head,” Watkins said. “This morning he received ten stitches at the University of Virginia Medical Center. Fortunately, Martese’s physical wounds are beginning to heal.”

He added: ""He holds numerous leadership positions on grounds, including Vice Chair for Community Relations of the Honor Committee, Vice Polemarch of the Eta Sigma Chapter of Kappa Alpha Psi, and a Chair of the Leadership Development Committee of the Black Student Alliance. He has no criminal record.

“As evidenced by both his academic and extracurricular achievements, Martese is a smart young man with a bright future,” Watkins said. “I have spoken with him several times today, and he is absolutely devastated by yesterday’s events. Currently, we are preparing to investigate and defend this matter vigorously. Please keep Martese in your prayers during this difficult time.”

Virginia ABC said in the statement that they are restricting the special agents involved in the incident to administrative duties while the investigation into the matter is underway.

This is not the first time an ABC agent has caused a controversy at the school. In 2013 they mistakenly thought the bottled water Elizabeth Daly was carrying to her car from the grocery story was beer, and the plain clothed officers surrounded her car, one even drawing a gun.

Daly panicked and drove away, because she didn’t know the men were police. She ended up spending one night in jail. Daly later sued the Alcoholic Beverage Control and collected a $212,500 settlement and a letter from the ABC board explaining the circumstances of her arrest to present to any future employer, according to a July 30, 2014 statement from the state Attorney General's office. The ABC did not admit any wrongdoing in the case.

The quotations actually were from a written statement by Vice President for Diversity and Equity Marcus L. Martin and Dean of African-American Affairs Maurice Apprey."

Attorney Robert Harris said his client, John Marshall, 52, had missing teeth and appeared to have some broken fingers. Marshall said he had gotten into a fight with a neighbor, identified as Theodore Hubbell Jr., 65.

Marshall then told Harris the body was in the back of the pickup truck, the lawyer said. “Once I learned of the facts, I called 911,” Harris told ABC affiliate WZVN-TV in Fort Myers.

The Lee County Sheriff’s Office confirmed it is investigating Hubbell’s death. At this point, no charges have been filed.

Harris called the situation “a clear-cut case of self-defense.”

Marshall lives in Cape Coral, near Fort Myers, and had purchased property off a dirt road in a rural neighborhood called Bokeelia, Harris said.

Marshall and his wife planned to build a house and had built a shed on the property, and they kept a camper there, Harris said. The neighbor didn't want Marshall to build in the rural area, Harris said.

A few days before the incident, Marshall and the neighbor argued, Harris said. Marshall called Harris, who advised his client to get a restraining order.

Harris said Marshall called police and reported the incident, but a restraining order had not been issued.

The situation turned physical Wednesday, and Marshall was pistol-whipped during the fight, Harris said. “He's distraught. He's a man who fought for his life, but it doesn't change the fact that someone is dead,” Harris said.

Neighbors are devastated by Hubbell’s death, and wonder why Marshall would drive with the body in his truck.

“If I, in self-defense, had to shoot somebody or kill somebody in my home or near my home, what would I do – drag the body into my vehicle and take it to my lawyer?” neighbor Jill Hammer told WZVN. “I would be calling 911. That’s what you do. Any sane person would.”

The family of Marvin Gaye filed an injunction on Tuesday to prevent copying, distributing and performing the hit song, Richard S. Busch, the family's lawyer, confirmed to ABC News.

""The trial in this action only included revenue from past sales of 'Blurred Lines.' The Gaye family is requesting an injunction so that the parties have time to negotiate how their father will be credited and how future sales will be shared,"" Busch explained.

""This type of relief is authorized by the Copyright Act and we believe is neither controversial nor unusual once a determination of infringement has been made,"" Busch added. ""That is because, without an injunction, the infringing product continues to be sold and the party whose work has been infringed is not receiving appropriate credit for their contribution, is not receiving a share of the copyright, and is not participating in the revenue from those sales. We would hope that an agreement will be reached so that, if the court decides to issue an injunction, it would then be lifted by agreement.""

In a statement to the Associated Press, the Gaye family added: ""With the digital age upon us, the threat of greater infringement looms for every artist. It is our wish that our dad's legacy, and all great music, past, present, and future, be enjoyed and protected, with the knowledge that adhering to copyright standards assures our musical treasures will always be valued.""

A jury ruled earlier this month that Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams copied parts of Gaye's song ""Got to Give It Up"" for ""Blurred Lines,"" and awarded the late singer's family approximately $7.4 million in damages. The jury ruled Clifford Harris, the rapper known as T.I. who performed on ""Blurred Lines"" and received a co-songwriting credit, did not infringe on the Gaye copyright.

However, according to the AP report, Gaye's family also sought Tuesday to change the verdict to include T.I., as well as Universal Music, Interscope Records and Star Trak Entertainment.

Williams spoke to the Financial Times, though he would not comment on whether he and Thicke will appeal the verdict, saying only, ""We're working out our next steps."" However, he insisted that there was no infringement in the making of ""Blurred Lines,"" and worried that this verdict could permanently damage the entertainment industry.

“Everything that’s around you in a room was inspired by something or someone,” he said. “If you kill that, there’s no creativity.”"

The planets orbit around Kepler 444, which at 11.2 billion years old, is more than twice as old as the sun, according to researchers at the University of Birmingham in Britain who published their findings today in the Astrophysical Journal.

Despite being 117 light-years away from Earth, in the direction of the constellations Cygnus and Lyra, researchers were able to learn more about the solar system using a practice called astroseismology.

Listening to the hum of Kepler 444, the team was able notice the slight changes in brightness created by the noise, which enabled them to measure the star's diameter, mass and calculate its approximate age.

Researchers studied the brightness of the star over time and detected planets passing in front of it, creating a slight dimming effect. Depending how much the light was dimmed, researchers were then able to measure the size of the planets, using Kepler 444 as a baseline.

""There are far-reaching implications for this discovery,"" lead researcher Tiago Campante said in a statement. ""We now know that Earth-sized planets have formed throughout most of the Universe's 13.8 billion year history, which could provide scope for the existence of ancient life in the Galaxy.""

Since the newly discovered planets are older than Earth is, researchers hope that by studying them, they may learn more about planet formation -- including what could be in store for our home."

“There is nothing he could’ve said or done that could provoke an officer of the law to assault him in such a manner,” Joshua Kinlaw told ABC News.

The roommate also said it’s common for the university’s underage students to try to enter bars.

“I am aware that Martese does not own a fake ID,” Kinlaw said. “So the ID that he actually showed to both the bouncer and to the ABC [Alcoholic Beverage Control] officers was his real ID. Now because the age on that ID shows him to be 20 years old, I think that’s when dispute and discrepancies came in,” Kinlaw said.

As for Johnson, he said Thursday he was ""shocked that my face was slammed into the brick pavement three blocks from where I attend school,"" as his attorney vowed to fight the charges. He was arrested early Wednesday morning outside the Charlottesville bar by state Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) agents who are charged with enforcing alcohol laws in Virginia.

""I trust that the scars on my face and head will heal but the trauma from what the ABC officers did will stay with me forever,"" Johnson, a third-year student, said through his attorney, Daniel Watkins.

Watkins also rebutted reports that Johnson may have shown false identification at the bar.

""At no point during the encounter ... did Martese present a fake ID,"" Watkins noted.

Johnson did not speak at the news conference, with Watkins reading a statement on his behalf.

""I still believe in our community. I know this community will support me during this time,"" he said in the statement.

Earlier in the day, students protested in the University of Virginia library to demonstrate Johnson's arrest.

Chants of ""black lives matter"" and ""no justice, no peace"" were heard inside the library after protesters moved their outdoor march inside around 12:30 p.m.

1H9fOER,2015-03-10 00:00:00,Oregon Community Donates Minivan So Boy Won’t Be Late to School Anymore - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/oregon-community-donates-minivan-boy-wont-late-school/story?id=29450439,"When a photo of a boy being punished at lunch for being late to school went viral, an Oregon community got together to make sure that didn’t happen again.

Hunter Cmelo and his family have a new minivan thanks to the local businesses in Medford, Oregon, and Grants Pass, Oregon, and a local radio host who heard his story.

The 6-year-old arrived late to Lincoln Elementary School last week because his family was having car trouble.

“[The school has] a policy where every three tardies, you get a detention,” Hunter’s mother, Nicole Garloff, 25, of Grants Pass, told ABC News. “Every tardy after that, you get a detention.”

Garloff said they knew Hunter would be getting a detention that day and that he was crying when he went in that morning. But she was shocked when she visited him at lunch that day and learned what his detention was actually like.

“He was at the first table as you walk into the cafeteria, and he was just sitting there with one of those cardboard poster partitions in front of him ... and two or three books next to him,” Garloff said.

She said the school policy was to have students make up work they missed because they were late. Since Hunter was only late by a few minutes, he didn’t have work to make up, so he was told to read a book.

“I was really upset. I went and got my iPad and took a picture of him,” said Garloff. “He wasn’t tardy so many times that he deserved that.

After Garloff posted the photo on her Facebook, the image of her son sitting alone at lunch went viral, coming to the attention of AM 1440 radio personality Bill Meyer. Meyer first heard about the story through his listeners and social media.

“We see a lot of bad news, or we have a lot of problems. So seldomly do we ever get a chance to fix the root of the problem,” Meyer told ABC News. “I saw the school policy as being unjust, but I saw the root of the trouble was car trouble.”

So Meyer reached out to Lisa McClease-Kelly, who owns Kelly’s Automotive, which is located in Medford and in Grants Pass, to see if she would be willing to repair the family’s Dodge Durango.

“The repairs were more than what the car was actually worth,” McClease-Kelly told ABC News. Luckily, a local company, Rapid Repo and Collections, offered to donate a 2001 Chrysler Town and Country van to the family.

Other local businesses pitched in to install a new windshield in the van, two new tires, and McClease-Kelly put about $1,400 of maintenance into it. Hunter’s family was surprised when they came to the shop this week.

“We thought we were going there to be told that our Durango was not going to be fixable at all,” Garloff said. “We were so shocked, it doesn’t seem real. I’m trying to tell Hunter that this doesn’t just happen to you.”

McClease-Kelly will give the family free oil changes for a year, and many others who heard their story donated to give the family a gas card, as well as gift cards to local restaurants.

“This family never asked for the help. All they ever wanted was to change the school policy,” Meyer said. “We saw a way to do a little nudge, and then everyone else came in with their time and generosity.”

The school policy has since been amended, according to the Grants Pass District Superintendent’s office.

“As a result of the concerns raised, the district ended the learning catch-up location at Lincoln Elementary School,” the Grants Pass District said in a statement. “Going forward, a separate, supervised classroom has been designated for necessary catch-up work.”

Garloff said Hunter hasn’t been late since the family got the van and that she is waiting to see if the school’s policy will change.

“We’re so thankful to all the people in our community that have just been so supportive,” Garloff said."
1Ha08AK,2015-03-27 00:00:00,Iran Nuclear Negotiations - Your Questions Answered - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/iran-nuclear-negotiations-questions-answered/story?id=29781703,"As the U.S. approaches a deadline for a nuclear deal with Iran, here are some basic facts about the negotiations to keep in mind:

The deadline for a deal between Iran and the P5+1 (U.S., U.K., Russia, China, France + Germany) on a broad technical framework for Iran’s nuclear program is March 31, as established by Secretary of State John Kerry in November when he announced a four-month extension of negotiations. The specific technical guidelines within that deal would need to be decided by June 30. Implementation of the agreement would begin after that date.

A deal would require Iran to halt production of all weapons-grade nuclear material for another 10 years -- as it has already done under an interim agreement -- and to submit to an intense inspection and verification process. In exchange, the international community and the U.S. would gradually lift heavy economic sanctions. Reports about the latest negotiations say the agreement would force Iran to cut the hardware it could use to make a bomb by about 40 percent. That would mean Iran would be allowed to keep 6,000 of the 10,000 centrifuges it has used to enrich uranium. Current estimates are that Iran could put together enough nuclear material for an atomic bomb in about two to three months, what is known as a “breakout time.” The U.S. believes a deal would push Iran’s breakout time to one year during the course of the 10-year moratorium.

Happy St. Patrick's Day from #Lausanne. #IranTalks resumed this morning w/ meeting between US & Iranian delegations pic.twitter.com/cVdUxQsg0d

Iran wants an economic recovery ... and fast. Iran’s leaders expect a deal will provide the country an immediate economic bump. But if that doesn’t happen, some analysts fear resentment towards Iranian President Hassan Rouhani could grow and eventually lead to a breakdown of the agreement. Analysts also say Iran’s economic problems run far deeper than the sanctions, so they’re skeptical that lifting sanctions alone will turn things around. Others hope that the mere announcement of a deal will boost public confidence and encourage European businesses to engage with Iran, giving Iran the bump it needs.

President Obama could lift some of the U.S. sanctions immediately but others would be lifted over time pending verification that Iran is complying with the agreement. Eventually, Congress will have to approve lifting some of the final sanctions, which could be problematic.

The P5+1 wants time. It wants to avoid the possibility that Iran’s nuclear pursuits could lead to a regional conflict. A 10-year nuclear moratorium, while not a permanent solution, gives the P5=1 countries that time. They want to avoid a nuclear arms race in the Gulf region. More specifically, they want to ensure that Iran’s most hardened nuclear facilities are no longer producing nuclear material.

The deal hinges, in large part, on the deep buried enrichment facility at Fordow. Iran wants to keep running hundreds of the centrifuges there for “scientific research,” but the U.S. wants Iran to completely repurpose the facility, fearing the centrifuges could be easily retooled for a quick, secret breakout. The U.S. is focusing on the Fordow facility because it is buried deep underground, possibly beyond the reach of the world’s most powerful “bunker-buster” bombs. So if Iran breaks the agreement, Fordow would be its most hardened and likely choice to begin producing the material.

No. This is not a treaty. If it were a treaty then Congress would have a say. But it’s not, so they don’t. This is a legally non-binding international agreement. And it’s only really enforceable to the degree that Iran is intimidated by the threat of further sanctions or, possibly, military strikes.

If no deal is reached and talks break down completely, then Iran would likely reject the interim agreement and try to erode current sanctions by reaching out aggressively to governments and companies around the world, enticing them to ignore sanctions. It would seek to circumvent oil embargoes with Europe and Asia that are the most bothersome sanctions for Iran, not the U.S. sanctions.

In a worst-case scenario, Iran’s supreme leader could decide to pursue a nuclear weapon, raising intense international concern because of the two- to three-month breakout time it needs to create enough material for a bomb. The U.S. would need Russia and China to act as voices of reason to put pressure on Iran not to pursue a program. Needless to say, that is a daunting prospect. If Iran does go nuclear, the U.S. would be looking at a potential arms race in the Gulf region, serious pressure to conduct military strikes and concerns that Israel might carry out military strikes.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has idealistic demands about completely dismantling Iran’s nuclear program. No deal is better than a bad deal, he says. And his rhetoric was at an all-time high ahead of his recent reelection. There is almost no chance the P5+1 could reach a deal that satisfies Netanyahu. So it’s more than likely, whether a deal is reached or not, that Netanyahu will simply continue to push for further sanctions. Most analysts believe Israel would not conduct strikes on its own.

Probably not. President Obama has threatened to veto any additional sanctions and Congress would need enough votes to override that veto. That’s unlikely to happen. Rep. Brad Sherman, a pro-Israel California Democrat and second-ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told ABC News Thursday that Netanyahu’s visit to Congress, while it may have served his and John Boehner’s political interests, reduced the chances of overriding a presidential veto legislation from “40 percent to 4 percent.” Why? Sherman believes the speech framed the debate as a personality contest between the president and the prime minister, which means Democrats are going to side with the president."
1HaMuOs,2015-03-07 00:00:00,8 Hip Chain Hotels You've (Probably) Never Heard Of -- But Will Love - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/hip-chain-hotels-heard-love/story?id=29440793,"Chain hotels often get a bad rap. Admittedly, some of them, with uninspired beige decor, industrial carpeting and airline-quality breakfasts, have earned it. But they're not all that way.

Some chain hotels are building their brand as hip and stylish, with restaurants that attract foodies and rooms that look straight out of Dwell magazine. Here, we bring you eight chain hotels that may not be on your radar, but definitely should be. Let's get started.

The Buddha-Bar brand does avant-garde luxury that combines neo-Asian architecture with traditional Western aesthetics. Unexpected chain traits include bold lipstick-red and black decor, resident DJs who spin trance house music, and Buddha statues, obviously. The first property opened in Prague in 2009. Today, there are Buddha-Bar Hotels in three European cities with a fourth property set to open in Armenia soon. Buddha-Bar Hotel Budapest Klotild Palace has a trendy spa, Asian-fusion restaurant decorated with a 40-foot-tall Buddha statue, and two late-night bars. Location is an important part of the company's trademark, so guests can rest assured that they'll be within walking distance of high-end shopping in trendy neighborhoods. Expect a price tag to match the luxury and convenience. If you can't get to Europe, cafes and spas under the brand's umbrella are sprinkled as far afield as Mexico, Caracas and Cairo.

There are seven 25Hours Hotels in five European cities: Berlin, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Vienna and Zurich. Each takes design to the next level; the Vienna outpost has a circus theme and roll-top tubs, while the Frankfurt property has teamed up with iconic fashion brand Levis. But our favorite hotel in the brand is the 25hours Hotel Bikini Berlin. The theme is, stay with us here, urban jungle meets Berlin zoo. Rooms are decked out with vintage-inspired, German-made Schindelhauer bikes and can include hammocks and views of the neighboring zoo, too. Stuffed monkeys are found in both the rooms and ultra-trendy lobby, which also includes industrial pipes, a record collection and a wall of green plants. Berliners and guests hang out at the 10th-floor Monkey Bar and listen to a DJ while nibbling snacks and admiring views of the zoo from floor-to-ceiling windows.

Boutique-style and happiness go hand-in-hand, sometimes with the added perk of the beach, at Joie de Vivre Hotels. There's a surfer-chic edge at many of the brand's properties in Arizona, Hawaii and California, with pops of citrus color that evoke the sun's rays. Pacific Edge on Laguna Beach, a Joie de Vivre Hotel, offers surf- and beach-oriented activities at the hotel's beach shack on Laguna Beach, along with chic outdoor seating and a restaurant overlooking the water. Pet-friendly perks include organic beds, water bowls and treats for canine visitors. Overall, the vibe is young and cheery.

The genius marketing idea behind the international Room Mate Hotels brand is to make guests feel as though they are simply staying with a stylish, fun and in-the-know friend in a great neighborhood. Each of the hotels, with outposts everywhere from New York City to Amsterdam to Granada, is named after a ""friend."" Rooms are set with notes from that fictional friend (who is usually pretty sexy -- at least on the hotel website), apologizing that they missed you but promising to meet up later. Brand standards include quality breakfasts, designer rooms and coveted locations. At Room Mate Emma in Barcelona, guests find a funky and futuristic vibe with rooms designed in hot pink. Prices are generally low and some properties are party hot spots.

The design-forward Generator Hostels brand offers a whole lotta bang for the millennium traveler buck in nine European cities. An event coordinator curates music, art, history, fashion and design for each property to ensure they all have a unique sense of place. They're designed to photograph well and be share-worthy on Instagram and Facebook (we know that made of lot of y'all's day). Wi-Fi is always free, but breakfast never is. Rooms range from co-ed spaces with bunk beds to stylish private rooms with outdoor spaces and in-suite bathrooms. Generator Hostel Dublin has a rad bar with a whiskey bottle chandelier, a movie theater room and a free Dublin walking tour.

TRYP hotels are endorsed by the luxury Wyndham brand, giving a certain sense of gravitas to the hipper, younger brand that states on its website, ""We want to wine you, dine you, recline you and Wi-Fi you."" Each of the hotels (found everywhere from Uruguay to Australia) focuses on food, rooms with the latest technology and helping guests feel like they're part of the city. TRYP New York City Times Square South is an excellent pick for stylish families. Some of the rooms have bunk beds and Keurig coffee machines. The Gastro Bar at 35th Street serves Mediterranean tapas and cocktails for parents, and chocolate churros for discriminating little ones.

The Hotel Indigo chain has it going on, with none of the pretension that can be found at some other cool hotels. There's a focus on neighborhood and community, with each hotel designed to emulate its surroundings. When possible, local purveyors supply ingredients at the restaurants and bars. These hotels are fresh, bright and approachable. Wi-Fi is always free, and pets are welcome. Hotel Indigo Nashville is known for its dark-stained hardwood floors and colorful furniture in the rooms, and upscale American cuisine at The District Bar and Kitchen.

From the moment guests step into the lobby at an Andaz Hotel (the boutique offshoot of the Hyatt brand), it's obvious that these properties are very cool. Traditional reception desks have been replaced by friendly hosts who check guests into the hotel with iPads. Luxe common areas and free on-demand beverages encourage guests to mingle, as does an early evening wine reception. At Andaz Tokyo Toranomon Hills, views from the top floors of the huge skyscraper can be downright distracting. The spa looks (and feels) out-of-this-world, with an organic blend bar and treatment rooms that overlook Tokyo. Rooms include Onsen-style soaking tubs and minibars stocked with free goodies, plus futuristic toilets and seasonally scented toiletries."
1HbEBre,2015-03-20 00:00:00,"Pope Expected to Lunch With Gay, HIV Positive and Transgender Prisoners - ABC News",http://abcnews.go.com/International/pope-expected-lunch-gay-hiv-positive-transgender-prisoners/story?id=29786524,"Pope Francis will reportedly lunch Saturday with gay, transgender and HIV positive prison inmates as part of a day trip to Southern Italy.

The Italian news site Vatican Insider reported the pontiff will lunch with about 90 prisoners, including 10 from a prison ward that houses those inmates. The report said the prisoners won their spot in a special raffle.

The one-day trip to Naples will also include a visit to the city’s poorest neighborhood, still a stronghold of organized crime.

The visit and luncheon echo one of the central messages of Francis’ papacy. ""Do not be afraid to go and to bring Christ into every area of life, to the fringes of society, even to those who seem farthest away, most indifferent,"" Francis said in 2013.

Francis, Vatican watchers say, continues to reach out to groups who previously felt judged or disenfranchised by the Church.

In February, the Vatican installed bathrooms and showers for the homeless in St. Peter’s Square last month.

Coming back from a gathering in 2013, the pope spoke about homosexuality to reporters. ""If they accept the Lord and have goodwill, who am I to judge them? They shouldn’t be marginalized. The tendency [to homosexuality] is not the problem…they’re our brothers.""

The pope's remarks should not be seen as softening the church's stance on gay marriage, however. In January, Francis criticized “ideological colonization of the family,"" which a Vatican spokesman later confirmed was at least in part a reference to gay marriage.

The trip will include a stop at nearby Pompeii. Plans for fireworks to mark the pope’s visit have been scrubbed as a sign of respect for victims of the recent terrorist attack in Tunisia."

The Death Row Records co-founder has pleaded not guilty to his charges of alleged murder, attempted murder and hit-and-run stemming from an incident that took place at the end of January in Compton, California.

The judge in the hearing Friday also added that Knight, 49, must show that no part of the money used -- if he can afford the bail -- was illegally obtained.

Knight's attorney, Matthew Fletcher, was not happy with this decision. He cited an example that even he would be investigated if he was to bail his client out.

After the hearing, Knight collapsed, hit his head on a chair and was sent to the hospital yet again.

During the hearing, Knight's lawyer had asked for a speedier trial, but the judge set the preliminary hearing for the week of April 13. Fletcher told reporters after the hearing and Knight's collapse that the living situation for his client in jail was ""torture.""

Fletcher also claimed that on the night of the incident -- that left one man Terry Carter, 55, dead -- he was attacked by multiple gang members and chose to leave the scene. When fleeing, he hit Carter with his vehicle.

According to the judge, Knight faces a minimum of 75 years in prison for the lesser of his charges if found guilty. Prosecution had argued for the $25 million bail by bringing up Knight's history of violence and alleging he was also a flight risk."

The suspect was identified as Richard White, 62, a taxi driver, Jefferson Parish Sheriff Newell Normand said in a press conference Friday night.

The officer fired three shots, one of which grazed a TSA agent running from White, according to John Fortunato, a public information officer for Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office. Two other TSA officers were sprayed with the wasp repellent. Two other people received minor injuries fleeing the scene.

The officer who shot White was identified by Fortunato as Lieutenant Heather Sylve, a 7 1/2 year veteran of the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office. According to a press release, White was swinging a machete at Sylve when she opened fire.

""As White drew closer to Lt. Slyve, while continuing to swing the machete,"" Fortunato said in a statement. ""Lt. Slyve fired three rounds striking White in the facial area, the chest and the leg.""

Police said they know of no connection between the suspect and anyone else at the airport and did not believe he was a traveler.

The suspect entered the airport and walked down the TSA pre-line where he encountered a TSA officer who was checking boarding passes to be scanned, police said. He was challenged by the TSA officer and he allegedly pulled a can of wasp spray and sprayed the TSA officer in the face.

The suspect proceeded past that checkpoint and confronted two other TSA officers, a female and a male. The suspect sprayed the male in the face, police said.

""Within moments,"" Fortunate said in a press release, ""White pulled from his waistband a large machete and began wielding the weapon at the TSA agents as well as nearby passengers.""

A male TSA officer grabbed a piece of luggage to defend himself, then the assailant chased him through the metal detector. After approaching the assailant with her weapon drawn, Lieutenant Sylve fired three times, stopping the assailant, police said.

Flights from the affected concourse were redirected to other terminals and operations continued except at Concourse B, which was closed for the investigation.

The suspect was taken from the airport to University Hospital where he is currently undergoing surgery.

According to authorities, the TSA agent who got shot during the incident sustained a non-threatening injury to the arm.

There was a security incident near concourse B of the airport The site has been secured We will release more info as it comes available"

The officer fired three shots, one of which grazed a TSA agent running from White, according to John Fortunato, a public information officer for Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office. Two other TSA officers were sprayed with the wasp repellent. Two other people received minor injuries fleeing the scene.

The officer who shot White was identified by Fortunato as Lieutenant Heather Sylve, a 7 1/2 year veteran of the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office. According to a press release, White was swinging a machete at Sylve when she opened fire.

""As White drew closer to Lt. Slyve, while continuing to swing the machete,"" Fortunato said in a statement. ""Lt. Slyve fired three rounds striking White in the facial area, the chest and the leg.""

Police said they know of no connection between the suspect and anyone else at the airport and did not believe he was a traveler.

The suspect entered the airport and walked down the TSA pre-line where he encountered a TSA officer who was checking boarding passes to be scanned, police said. He was challenged by the TSA officer and he allegedly pulled a can of wasp spray and sprayed the TSA officer in the face.

The suspect proceeded past that checkpoint and confronted two other TSA officers, a female and a male. The suspect sprayed the male in the face, police said.

""Within moments,"" Fortunate said in a press release, ""White pulled from his waistband a large machete and began wielding the weapon at the TSA agents as well as nearby passengers.""

A male TSA officer grabbed a piece of luggage to defend himself, then the assailant chased him through the metal detector. After approaching the assailant with her weapon drawn, Lieutenant Sylve fired three times, stopping the assailant, police said.

Flights from the affected concourse were redirected to other terminals and operations continued except at Concourse B, which was closed for the investigation.

The suspect was taken from the airport to University Hospital where he is currently undergoing surgery.

According to authorities, the TSA agent who got shot during the incident sustained a non-threatening injury to the arm.

There was a security incident near concourse B of the airport The site has been secured We will release more info as it comes available"

Seattle Mayor Ed Murray's decision comes in response to the law signed Thursday by Indiana Gov. Mike Pence that allows businesses to refuse service to gays and lesbians for religious reasons.

Murray said Indiana's new law ""doesn't reflect the values"" of Seattle.

""Seattle has been a leader in the fight to protect civil rights and ensure equality for all people -- no matter who you are, or who you love,"" Murray said today in a statement.

""This is why I am ordering that none of our taxpayer dollars should go toward supporting this discriminatory law,"" Murray's statement continued.

Supporters of the law say it prevents the government from compelling people to provide services such as wedding photography for same-sex weddings or other activities they find objectionable on religious grounds.

""This bill is not about discrimination,"" Pence had said, ""and if I thought it legalized discrimination I would have vetoed it.""

In an interview today with the Indianapolis Star, Pence said he will support legislation to clarify the law.

""I support religious liberty, and I support this law,"" Pence said. ""But we are in discussions with legislative leaders this weekend to see if there's a way to clarify the intent of the law.""

But hundreds of people gathered outside of the Indiana Statehouse on Saturday, some carrying ""no hate in our state"" signs, to rally against the law.

Consumer review service Angie's List also said today that it is suspending a planned expansion in Indianapolis because of the new law.

Angie's List had sought an $18.5 million incentive package from Indianapolis' City-County Council to add 1,000 jobs over five years. But founder and CEO Bill Oseterle said in a statement that the expansion was on hold ""until we fully understand the implications of the freedom restoration act on our employees.""

Celebrities including Ashton Kutcher and Andy Cohen have expressed opposition to the law.

Indiana are you also going to allow Christian establishments to ban Jews from coming in? Or Vice Versa? Religious freedom??? #OUTRAGE

I can now legally be denied service in Indiana because I am gay, or Jewish? Am I right, @GovPenceIN? Sounds like a fun place to visit!

Murray said he will issue an official executive order next week.

The injured man was identified as Kevin Fleming, 20, of Baltimore, according to law enforcement sources. Fleming and another man were in a stolen Ford Escape SUV when they encountered NSA police at the entrance to the Ft. Meade complex, sources said.

Shortly before 9 a.m. ET, a vehicle with two people inside ""attempted an unauthorized entry at a National Security Agency gate,"" according to a statement from the NSA.

""The driver failed to obey an NSA Police officer's routine instructions for safely exiting the secure campus,"" the statement continued. ""The vehicle failed to stop and barriers were deployed.""

Sources say the two inside were men dressed as women. Preliminary information indicated the two men were partying at an area hotel with a third individual when they took that individual's car without permission. However, it's still unclear how or why they ended up at the NSA gate.

The owner of the SUV picked up two men dressed as women in Baltimore late Sunday, sources confirmed. The three allegedly drove to a hotel in Howard County, Maryland, where they partied, sources said. Early this morning, the man woke up alone and the two men he allegedly had picked up were gone and so was his vehicle, sources said. The man reported his vehicle stolen to Howard County Police before the incident at the NSA, sources said.

A law enforcement source confirmed that the car that crashed at NSA was reported stolen in Howard County, Maryland.

When the vehicle ""accelerated toward an NSA police car blocking the road"" and ""refused to stop,"" an NSA police officer opened fire, and one of the two men inside the ""unauthorized vehicle"" ended up dead, the NSA statement said. The other man in the vehicle was ""severely injured” and taken to a local hospital, according to sources.

An NSA Police officer injured in the incident was also taken to the hospital.

“The incident has been contained and is under investigation,” Colonel Brian Foley, Fort Meade garrison commander, said in a statement. “The residents, service members and civilian employees on the installation are safe. We continue to remain vigilant at all of our access control points.""

The FBI said they do not believe the incident is related to terrorism.

One person was killed and several others injured at a mobile home park in Sand Springs, about seven miles west of Tulsa, after a possible tornado formed nearby, said the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office. Some 36,500 power outages had been reported in northeast Oklahoma as of 3:30 a.m. Thursday morning local time.

Another possible tornado briefly touched down in Moore, about 11 miles south of Oklahoma City, reports KOCO. A radio tower was toppled and a few roofs were taken off homes, but no injuries were immediately reported, said a spokesperson for the city. School was cancelled Thursday because of damage across the district, Moore Public Schools said on its Facebook page.

No major injuries were reported in Tulsa, said fire officials. A children's gym collapsed and search and rescue operations were underway at a mobile home park, said the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office.

The National Weather Service issued tornado warnings and sirens blared as severe storms moved through central and northeast Oklahoma. Cars and trucks were overturned on I-35, KOCO reported.

The Storm Prediction Center warned that a clash of warm and cooler air masses could lead to severe storms. The storms produced at least one tornado, heavy rain and half-dollar size hail.

1HhNOyE,2015-03-31 00:00:00,"After Just Six Hours, Defense Rests in Boston Bombing Trial - ABC News",http://abcnews.go.com/US/hours-defense-rests-boston-bombing-trial/story?id=30034145,"In the Boston Marathon bombing trial the prosecution took 92 witnesses and more than three weeks to present their case, but today the defense for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev rested after just four witnesses and about six hours.

Weeks ago during opening statements defense attorney Judy Clarke admitted to Tsarnaev’s role in the bombing and the violent aftermath, but argued it was Dzhokhar’s older brother Tamerlan who was primarily responsible for the mayhem nearly two years ago in April 2013. In the six hours she used today, Clarke focused on evidence that she said showed it was Tamerlan who “led the way.”

One witness, an FBI fingerprint analyst, told jurors that investigators found a fingerprint or fingerprints from Tamerlan Tsarnaev on a pressure cooker bomb lid recovered from Watertown, where the brothers engaged in a firefight with police days after the bombing, on possible bomb making supplies including rolls of tape, a caulking gun, a soldering gun, a jar of nails, and a book on DIY wiring all found in the Tsarnaev family home. None of those items, potential bomb components, had Dzhokhar's fingerprints.

The analyst also testified that 500 items were tested for fingerprints from the marathon bombing scenes, but only two items had recoverable fingerprints. Pieces of cardboard believed to be part of the first bomb contained prints belonging to Tamerlan, none to Dzhokhar. A shredded backpack also located at the scene contained a crumbled piece of paper that had Tamerlan's palm prints but, again, none belonging to Dzhokhar, the analyst said.

The prosecution fired back, however, saying that just because an item doesn't contain a fingerprint doesn't mean someone did not touch it. ""They could've used gloves,” the government said.

Earlier today a computer forensic expert, testifying for the defense, said it was on Tamerlan's laptop that experts found the search terms: ""Ruger"" ""gun store"" and ""fireworks firing system,” but not on Dzhokhar's laptop. The brothers would use a Ruger 9mm pistol to allegedly murder a police officer three days after the marathon bombing.

That same expert testified that Tamerlan's computer showed searches for ""Boston Marathon,"" but Dzhokhar's laptop didn't search that term until after the bombings.

The defense showed a digital trail that they said showed Tamerlan downloaded an issue of Inspire magazine to his computer then transferred it to a thumb drive. That same thumb drive used to transfer the Inspire copy to Dzhokhar's computer, the defense said. The magazine included an infamous bomb-making how-to article called “How to Build a Bomb in the Kitchen of Your Mom.”

A majority of searches on Dzhokhar's computer showed he was mostly on Facebook or a Russian social networking site, the defense said.

Clarke had said during opening remarks that while Tamerlan was “looking and immersed in death and destruction and carnage in the Middle East, Dzhokhar spent most of his time doing what teenagers do: Facebook, cars, girls.”

In another rebuttal, the prosecution argued that it is impossible to know who is using a computer unless there is a camera planted on it showing someone actively operating the device. On at least on one occasion, the prosecution said, Dzhokhar did use Tamerlan's computer to log into his personal email account.

Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed in the Watertown shootout three days after two bombs exploded near the finish line of the Boston Marathon, killing three people and wounding 260 others on April 15, 2013. Dzhokhar escaped the shootout but was captured hours later hiding in a dry-docked boat. Bleeding in the boat, he had allegedly scrawled a message implying the marathon bombing was revenge for the death of “innocent Muslims” in the Middle East.

Dzhokhar has pleaded not guilty to 30 counts related to the bombing, and, if convicted, he could face the death penalty.

At the end of today’s session, the judge announced the trial will take a break for a few days with closing arguments starting next Monday."

The recipe to cure eye infections comes from ""Bald’s Leechbook,"" an old English leather-bound tome that was buried deep within the British Library in London. When scientists painstakingly followed a step-by-step recipe to recreate the old world salve, they found it killed over 90 percent of a Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus -- also known as the MRSA bacteria -- that was grown in a petri dish of mouse cells.

The tenth-century concoction contained two species of allium (garlic, plus either onion or leek), wine from a vineyard that has existed since the ninth century and oxgall, the bile from a cow’s stomach. A very specific set of instructions included brewing the solution in a brass vessel, straining it through a cloth and then letting the mixture sit for nine days before use.

The researchers concluded it wasn’t one particular ingredient that did the trick but rather the entire recipe.

“We thought that Bald’s eye salve might show a small amount of antibiotic activity, because each of the ingredients has been shown by other researchers to have some effect on bacteria in the lab,"" Freya Harrison, one of the lead Nottingham researchers, said in a statement. “But we were absolutely blown away by just how effective the combination of ingredients was.”

Each year, 90,000 Americans suffer from invasive MRSA infection, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It has become one of the most antibiotic-resistant bugs known, costing billions of dollars in health care spending and killing about 20,000 yearly. The CDC says MRSA is a particular threat in hospital settings, though in recent years infections from the deadly bacteria have declined by over 50 percent.

While the results of the experiment are intriguing, the team is looking for more funding to see if the treatment has any practical application in the real world. The preliminary results done using the simple mouse cells were presented at the annual conference of the Society for General Microbiology in Birmingham earlier this week."
1HjBopV,2015-04-01 00:00:00,"Alabama Baby Born Without a Nose, Mom Says He's Perfect - ABC News",http://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/alabama-baby-born-nose-mom-perfect/story?id=30050043,"Eli Thompson came into this world in the late afternoon of March 4, perfectly healthy, but with one distinction -- he didn't have a nose.

""The day I delivered, everything went fine,"" mom Brandi McGlathery told ABC News today. ""At 4:42 when he was born, he came out and the doctor put him on my chest. When I took a closer look at him, I said, 'He doesn't have a nose,' and they took him out of the room.""

McGlathery said that her doctor sat beside her bed to explain to her what was wrong with Eli.

""He had the most apologetic look on his face,"" she said. ""I knew right away that something was wrong.""

Although her baby showed no signs of additional abnormalities, McGlathery said she was at first shocked and upset to hear the news from her doctor.

Dr. R. Craig Brown, McGlathery's obstetrician, said his own research has revealed only 38 cases of ""absolutely nothing being wrong other than no nose."" That's very, very rare.

""I've seen facial abnormalities, cleft lip and palate, but this is the first time I've seen a case with just no nose,"" Brown told ABC News.

McGlathery became Brown's patient early in her pregnancy, he said, noting that the 23-year-old mom of three showed no signs of a high risks, and tests showed Eli to have a nasal bone.

""She came in right at 37 weeks and went into labor,"" Brown said. ""Once I delivered him and we cleaned him off I could tell something wasn't right, but I didn't want to alarm her.""

Other than not having a nose, ""he's doing great,"" Brown said. ""He's a super cute kid and you could tell he was fighting.""

""I recounted everything I did throughout my pregnancy to figure out if i did something wrong,"" McGlathery said. ""I realized it was nothing anyone did. I mean, he's perfect. I'm not going to say I was sad. I was just scared for him because I didn't think he'd make it.""

Because Eli was born without a nose, he must use a tracheostomy, a tube that will assist his breathing.

McGlathery said she and her family have all been trained in controlling her child's equipment, and all received CPR training.

""After I realized nothing wrong was him health-wise, I was scared what other people would say,"" McGlathery said. ""I don't ever want my son to come home and say 'mommy, somebody made fun of my nose.' But I also don't want others to pity him.""

On March 30, McGlathery brought Eli home and she said he's been doing wonderfully since.

""He's an extremely happy baby and does cute stuff all the time,"" she said. ""There's a reason aside from his health issue and not having a nose as to why we call him our miracle baby. He just tugs on people's heart strings. It's his demeanor.""

""I don't think my son will ever have an idea of how much he's impacted people,"" McGlathery added. ""He's definitely started something and has got a big purpose in life. He's going to have one hell of a testimony to tell people one day."""

Düsseldorf prosecutor Christoph Kumpa also said that a second black box had been recovered as the probe into Andreas Lubitz's actions continues more than a week after the crash.

The officials said they had recovered a tablet from Lubitz's home that had been used between March 16 and 23, the day before the crash. Kumpa said Lubitz, 27, had also used the tablet to do research for ways to carry out suicide -- suggesting a degree of premeditation.

The Germanwings plane that departed from Barcelona crashed en route to Dusseldorf on March 24 with all 150 people on board killed on impact.

German authorities had previously said that Lubitz had also been treated by a psychotherapist because of previous suicidal tendencies and that he had deliberately flown the jetliner into a mountain.

Authorities did not find a suicide note.

Also today, French Prosecutor Brice Robin in Marseille confirmed the recovery of the black box, which was burnt. They are continuing to identify victims with the help of DNA provided by family members. The officials said they are hopeful to be able to get information from the flight data recorder despite its condition.

Robin also said they found 42 cellphones in the wreckage and that they were ""very, very damaged.""

Asked about the cellphone video that purported to show the final moments before the plane went down, Robin said, ""I don't have any information"" about it.

Germanwings CEO Olivier Wagner, speaking at a press conference in Marseille earlier this week, called the crash the ""saddest day of my life. The families are always asking me, 'Why had this happen?' I cannot give them an answer.""

Authorities have said Lubitz hid evidence of an illness from his employers, including a sick note that was found torn up inside his apartment in Dusseldorf dated from the day of the crash.

One such actor who could have been nominated for best actor and wasn't was David Oyelowo, who portrayed Martin Luther King Jr. in ""Selma."" He spoke Sunday during an appearance at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival and said the Academy prefers to reward blacks ""more for when we are subservient, when we are not being leaders or kings or being at the center of our own narrative.""

In a video posted by the Hollywood Reporter's Scott Feinberg, Oyelowo, 38, said, ""this is truly my feeling, I felt this before the situation [this year] and I feel it now.""

He added, ""To me, Denzel Washington should have won for playing Malcolm X.""

Oyelowo also brought up Sidney Poitier and his win, not for ""In the Heat of the Night,"" but ""Lilies of the Field,"" where he plays a traveling handyman.

""We have to come to the point where there isn't a self-fulfilling prophecy, a notion of who black people are, that feeds into what we are celebrated as ... in life generally,"" he said. ""We have been slaves, we have been domestic servants, we have been criminals ... but we've been leaders, we've been kings. We've been those who've changed the world.""

He said those films in which blacks are leaders and game-changers are hard to get made, pointing out the fact the Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated five decades ago.

""There's no film where Dr. King has been the center of his own narrative till now,"" referring to ""Selma.""

Oyelowo said he thinks ""The Butler"" and ""12 Years a Slave"" and their success at the box office -- making upwards of $200 million each -- made ""Selma"" possible.

""There is a fear of white guilt, so you have a very nice white person who holds black people's hands throughout their own narrative,"" he said. ""Also, we don't want to see that pain again. So, we don't really go into what that pain was in an authentic way. ... You can't have people curating culture in this way.""

He continued, ""We need to see these things in order to move forward.""

1Hnb3vf,2015-01-30 00:00:00,"Taliban Are Not Terrorists, or So Says the White House - ABC News",http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/taliban-terrorists-white-house/story?id=28588120,"They act like terrorists, they regularly kill civilians like terrorists, but the White House does not consider the Afghan Taliban to be a terrorist group.

“They do carry out tactics that are akin to terrorism. They do pursue terror attacks in an effort to try to advance their agenda,” White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest explained today, but “they have a different classification.”

Even so, the White House does not call the Afghan Taliban a terrorist organization, Earnest explained, because they are “different than an organization like al Qaeda that has a much broader global aspiration to carry out acts of violence and acts of terror against Americans and American interests all around the globe.”

The issue has come up because the White House insisted on Wednesday that a prisoner exchange between Jordan and ISIS would be different than the prisoner exchange the United States made last year with the Taliban to gain the release of Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl.

“Our policy is that we don't pay ransom. We don't give concessions to terrorist organizations,” Deputy Press Secretary Eric Schultz said Wednesday. “This is a longstanding policy that predates this administration. And it's also one that we've communicated to our friends and allies across the world.”

Schultz explained that the exchange the United States made with the Taliban -- releasing five Taliban prisoners from the Guantanamo Bay detention facility in exchange for the release of Sgt. Bergdahl -- was consistent with that policy because the Taliban is an “armed insurgency” and not a terrorist organization.

But the Obama administration isn’t entirely consistent on this point.

On one hand, the Afghan Taliban are not on the State Department’s list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations (the Pakistan Taliban is on that last). On the other hand, the Taliban is on the Treasury Department’s list of Specially Designated Global Terrorists, a classification that allows their assets to be frozen.

And even as Earnest was explaining why the Taliban are not terrorists, he slipped, calling them ... “terrorists.”

“We have not ruled out that there would be some situations in which U.S. service members would still carry out operations in self-defense against the Taliban or other terrorists who are operating in Afghanistan,” Earnest said."
1HrQLg1,2015-04-03 00:00:00,"Louis Jordan, Sailor Missing for 66 Days, Recalls His Surreal Journey - ABC News",http://abcnews.go.com/US/louis-jordan-sailor-missing-66-days-recalls-surreal/story?id=30080304,"Louis Jordan had lots of time to think, to reflect, to pray, to hope, to struggle, to wonder whether his life was going to end.

The 37-year-old sailor embarked on a fishing trip on Jan. 23. But after his ship, “The Angel,” capsized, Jordan drifted further and further from the shoreline, eventually being rescued 200 miles off of North Carolina’s coast. He was missing for 66 days, but speaking to ABC News following his rescue, he said the journey felt more like 100 days. His captain’s log was lost in the water, along with his books, rice and most of his supplies.

“My boat got flipped and did a 180 on me while I was sleeping at night, and I was flying through the air and somersaulting and all my junk and all my equipment, all my GPS devices and everything, even my stove dislodged and it was all flying with me, all rolling around,” he said.

Jordan said he suffered a broken collarbone when his boat flipped over.

He survived on gumption, problem-solving and pancakes -- two or three each day, flour fried in oil. Jordan was able to capture rainwater, too -- when it rains in the ocean, the rainwater tastes like coconut milk, he said. He also used his laundry to trap fish, which proved to be more successful than his net.

“Every ounce of energy, there was food. And I was limited on food,” he told ABC News.

Jordan credits his faith with helping through the ordeal. He read his Bible during his 66-day journey and regularly prayed. Jordan said he wasn’t as concerned about his own well-being as he was about his family and friends.

“I was worried about them more than anything else,” he said. ""Their poor hurt feelings, if I’m ever going to show up again or not, not knowing if I abandoned them, that’s really worrying.""

Jordan’s parents reported him missing on Jan. 29, but after 10 days of searches with no sign of Jordan or the ship, the case was suspended.

As the days passed and his supplies dwindled, Jordan floated on until Thursday, when people aboard a German-flagged ship, Houston Express, spotted him floating on the damaged boat’s hull and contacted the Coast Guard in Portsmouth, Virginia. The ship took him aboard, and he was later airlifted by a Jayhawk helicopter, treated at a hospital for dehydration and released.

Jordan reunited with his father Frank Thursday in a tearful hug.

Jordan said his journey has given him perspective. He’d like to have children someday. Maybe he’ll write a book. The one thing he really wanted after 66 days at sea?

“Organic ice cream,” he said."
1HsVF0B,2015-01-30 00:00:00,Father of Psych Ward Stabbing Victim Says Mental Patients Treated Like 'Prisoners' - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Health/father-psych-ward-stabbing-victim-mental-patients-treated/story?id=28559283,"The father of man stabbed to death by his roommate in a southern California hospital psych ward won $3 million in punitive damages this week against the hospital where his son died. But money isn't on his mind.

He wants to make sure it never happens again.

""Mentally challenged individuals have just as many rights as other people,"" Joseph Camacho, 79, told ABC News. ""Most of the time, they [hospitals] just seem to ignore them and treat them like prisoners instead of a patient.""

His son, Dean Camacho, who was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, was attacked at Pacifica Hospital of the Valley in Sun Valley, California, by his roommate, Jerry Romansky in 2011, according to court documents. The hospital put the two men in the same room of the hospital's behavioral health unit despite Romansky's violent history, and didn't check on them every 15 minutes as they were supposed to, according to the plaintiff's trial brief. Romansky was hearing voices that told him to ""kill himself and others,"" according to the brief, and he had tried to strangle a previous roommate at Pacifica with a towel, it said.

Though rooms throughout the hospital were equipped with emergency buzzers, they had been disabled in the mental health wing, according to Joseph Camacho's lawyer, John Marcin.

Romansky, whose father testified against the hospital as well, stabbed Camacho with a metal bracket that he broke off from a toilet in the room, severing one of Camacho's arteries and causing him to bleed to death, Marcin said.

He said the hospital's deficiencies had mostly not changed in the more than three years since the murder.

""I think that's why the jury became so angry,"" Marcin said. ""I asked the jury for $2 million in punitive damages, and they came back and awarded 3 [million dollars], they were so angry.""

The jury awarded $5.2 million in damages in all.

""It gives you a good feeling that you're all on the same page,"" Camacho said. ""The hospital wasn't.""

Joseph Camacho and Romansky's father had a connection in a way because they each lost a son, Joseph Camacho said. Dean Camacho died, and Romansky is serving a prison sentence as a result of Camacho's murder. They'd both been wronged by the hospital, he said.

Pacifica Hospital of the Valley did not respond to ABC News' request for comment.

The hospital's lawyer, Vincent D'Angelo, told ABC News that the hospital has not yet decided whether to appeal, but that hospital officials are sorry for Camacho's loss.

Another lawyer for one of the doctors who settled out of court argued that the doctor had no knowledge Romansky would become violent and kill Camacho, and that the two men did not have any prior conflict, according to the defense brief."
1HZMVLT,2015-03-20 00:00:00,'Race Together': Starbucks Stirs Up Controversy With Race Relation Campaign - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Business/race-starbucks-stirs-controversy-race-relation-campaign/story?id=29726584,"The next time you go to Starbucks, you may see more than your name scribbled on the side of your cup.

The Seattle-based coffee chain is launching a new campaign to address race relations by asking employees to write ""Race Together"" on the side of customers' cups.

The idea is to spark a conversation between baristas and customers.

""What if we were to write 'Race Together' on every Starbucks cup, and that facilitated a conversation between you and our customers?"" Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz says in a video message to employees in explaining the campaign. ""And what if our customers as a result of that had a renewed level of understanding and sensitivity about the issue, and they themselves would spread that to their own sphere of influence?""

The initiative has created quite a stir on social media -- so much so that the company's senior vice president of communications temporarily deleted his Twitter account under an avalanche of criticism, saying he felt ""personally attacked in a cascade of negativity.""

Despite the negative reactions, Schultz says the campaign is happening.

""Some people have said, 'Howard, this is not a subject we should touch. This is not for you. This is not for a company. This is for someone else.' I reject that. I reject that completely,"" he says in the video.

In addition, two attackers have also been killed, Prime Minister Habib Essid said, calling it a ""cowardly terrorist operation"" that targeted tourists.

The tourists were attacked while they were getting off a bus to enter the museum, Essid said, noting this is the first attack there targeting tourists.

The attackers were wearing military fatigues, and when the tourists ran toward the museum to avoid the shooting, the attackers pursued them, Essid said.

Among the 17 tourists killed, the nationalities included Polish, German, Italian and Spanish, Essid said.

An additional 22 tourists and two Tunisians were injured, he said.

Radek Sikorski, speaker of Polish Parliament, said seven Polish tourists were dead and three were in in critical condition. And the Italian Foreign Ministry told ABC News that three Italians were dead and six were wounded.

The country's Interior Ministry initially said earlier today that eight people had been killed but also noted that a number of hostages were also being held captive in the museum and that security forces were deployed inside it.

Carina D. Klein, a spokesperson for the U.S. Embassy in Tunis, told ABC News they cannot confirm nor deny whether Americans are among the those dead in the attack.

Massachusetts State Police Trooper Robert McCarthy, a member of the bomb squad, told the jury he heard repeated calls over the radio several times about the brothers ""throwing bombs at us.""

""We heard what we believed to be some type of explosive and saw smoke in the street lamps,"" McCarthy said.

When the shooting stopped, McCarthy said he found ""potential pipe bombs in the middle of the road.""

Jurors were shown two unexploded pipe bombs, one that McCarthy said was ""very heavy"" and curved so it wouldn't roll when it landed. ""It was full"" of explosive powder, he said.

""It's basically [a pipe] elbow, approximately two inches in diameter. It still has one end-cap on it and one end-cap removed,"" he said, noting that the devices are more like ""improvised grenades,"" because ""it won't roll away. It will land and stop.""

A second device the jury saw was straight, also ""full"" of explosive powder, according to McCarthy. ""This pipe is also lined with BBs,"" he said.

Shrapnel from the bombs that the defendants threw during their climactic battle with police were found everywhere: inside cars, on front lawns, in backyards, on roofs, inside homes, McCarthy said, and slugs from Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's gun were embedded in walls.

On the floorboard behind the driver's seat in the Mercedes SUV that the Tsarnaev brothers allegedly carjacked, investigators found what they thought was another bomb, McCarthy said, describing it as ""basically a Tupperware box that had a fuse coming out of it"" and ""two to three pounds"" of explosive powder.

As it was held in front of jurors, McCarthy described it as ""another improvised explosive device.""

The court also released today the questionnaire used during jury selection. It included the question ""Have any of your siblings tried to influence your direction in life or your major life decisions?""

Defense lawyers have asserted that Tsarnaev was under the influence of his older brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, and that he was not himself a committed terrorist.

Potential jurors were also asked in the questionnaire whether they had strong opinions about Islam or whether the U.S. ""acts unfairly toward Muslims.""

Tsarnaev faces the death penalty after he and his brother allegedly placed twin bombs at the finish line of the 2013 Boston Marathon, killing three people and injuring 260 others. Tsarnaev has pleaded not guilty to the 30 counts against him, including charges of using a ""weapon of mass destruction resulting in death,"" but his defense attorney has said that he participated in the bombing."

Coast Guard members happened to look through a window and see a Labrador jump into Lake Betsie, connected to Lake Michigan, on Tuesday around 10 a.m., Petty Officer Tim Putnam told ABC News today.

Putnam and an ice rescue crew then rushed to get into their dry suits and help the dog, he said.

The 20-minute rescue, caught on video, was ""exhausting and difficult,"" Putnam said. ""There were a lot of heavy chunks and plates of ice I had to move around to get to the dog, who seemed shook up and shivering.""

The rest of the rescue team pulled the dog in using a line and dried it off, he said.

The Labrador, later found out to be named Bailey, was transported to Benzie County Animal Shelter, where she was examined and cared for.

""The doctor said was she very fortunate to be alive and OK, because she didn't have much time,"" Putnam said.

Bailey's owner was later found after a search, he added.

""The owner saw her dog early in the morning, and then it was just gone,"" Putnam said. ""We discovered the dog traveled over eight miles to the lake.""

The Coast Guard cautioned that people should not to try and go into icy waters themselves if a person or animal is stranded, but should call the Coast Guard."
1I1WsFW,2015-02-04 00:00:00,Taiwan Plane Crash: What We Can Learn About the TransAsia Airways Crash - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/International/transasia-airways-learn-crash-dashcam-footage/story?id=28721111,"The unbelievable dashcam footage of a plane careening into a river in Taipei, Taiwan, has revealed some major clues about what happened in the moments before the fatal crash.

""It was just pretty clear what happened. It's a classic stall -- a loss of lift,"" said ABC News aviation and military consultant Steve Ganyard.

The pilot reportedly called in a mayday, saying that one of the engines had failed. Ganyard said that the footage appears to at least partly support that claim.

""A lot of times when you're flying on one engine and you get too slow and it stalls,"" he said. ""It will tend to fall out on one side or the other.""

In the case of the TransAsia Airways flight, ""it was the left wing that fell first,"" Ganyard said.

While the visible tilt makes it clear that one side had more power than the other, Ganyard said that the failure of one engine does not necessarily explain why the plane went on to crash.

""None of this really makes sense just yet because an airplane with two engines should fly perfectly well with just one,"" he said.

Pilots like those in the cockpit on this flight should have been able to handle such a malfunction, especially since these pilots had logged a ""good"" number of hours in the cockpit, according to Ganyard.

""It does take some piloting skill and good training to fly around with one engine but we didn't see any other contributing factors,"" Ganyard said.

The flight route and the location of the crash does clearly show the pilots were aware of problems and actively tried to stay near the water to help with a possible landing.

Though the footage of the plane's wing clipping the freeway is dramatic, that damage is nothing compared to the potential disaster that could have happened if the plane had hit a nearby building instead.

Ganyard pointed out that in the final moments before the crash, the nose of the plane is kept pointed up to avoid what appears to be an apartment building, and by clipping a wing on the bridge, that lessened some of the impact on the water when it did crash.

While at least 31 fatalities have been confirmed at this point, those final moves by the pilot likely helped save lives, Ganyard said. He said he was surprised by how relatively unscathed the survivors were as they were rescued from the site.

""The fact that people were able to climb out is really surprising,"" he said. ""You didn't see anybody bloodied. You just saw people standing there."""

Bridgeton police officer Jonathan Hovermann and Class II officer Jennifer Skala found the animal on Irving Ave. near Inspira Hospital after a passerby called about the goat the Bridgeton Police Department wrote on Facebook.

He was temporarily named ""Burgy"" and transferred to Cumberland County SPCA in Vineland, where he was placed in one of the pens for farm animals, junior volunteer coordinator Jessica Morrison told ABC News today.

""He’s doing very well,"" Morrison said. ""He's totally friendly, and we haven't had any issues with him.""

Police and the SPCA is hoping the owner will contact them soon, she added.

Stray farm animals are rare to find, but they do get lost, Morrison said.

People in the Faroe Islands, which are located in the North Atlantic, halfway between Iceland and Norway, had front-row seats to the eclipse, which occurred early Friday as the new moon completely covered the sun.

This is the world's first total solar eclipse since November 2013. A partial solar eclipse was also visible in most of Europe.

The United States will have its turn to enjoy a total solar eclipse when it passes over the country on Aug. 21, 2017, according to NASA.

The moon will also reach perigee on Friday, the point where it is closest to the Earth, creating a supermoon -- albeit a dark one -- that will add another element to the total solar eclipse.

Get ready for spring if you live in the northern hemisphere.

The official start of spring, the vernal equinox, will be marked on Friday at 6:45 p.m. ET when the Earth's axis lines up perpendicularly to the sun's rays -- marking one of the two equinoxes that occur each year."

That’s kind of like what happened to 2-year-old Quincy Kroner.

The Cincinnati tot, his dad said, loves garbage trucks. “Every Friday he knows they’re coming,” Ollie Kroner said. “From the moment he hears them from blocks away he runs to the window, climbs up on the couch and watches them.”

Turns out the guys in the truck are fans of Quincy, too. Kroner said the driver “puts on a show” for Quincy, honking and waving. “They’ve developed a kind of relationship through the window,” he added.

Quincy likes the garbage trucks and the men who drive them so much that his prize for successful potty training was – you guessed it – a garbage truck. Which, of course, he couldn’t wait to show his friends.

So when the truck rolled up to the Kroner’s last Friday, Quincy’s big moment had arrived. Kroner asked the men whether they would be willing to take a photo, which they were. But all of a sudden, their star power proved too much for Quincy.

“He was so excited leading up to it but then when the moment came he became undone,” Kroner said, adding that the noise of the truck may have been louder up close than the little boy was expecting.

But, Kroner said, Quincy recovered quickly after the photo was taken. “I just don’t think he thought it all the way through.”"
1I6UhNy,2015-03-20 00:00:00,"Pope Expected to Lunch With Gay, HIV Positive and Transgender Prisoners - ABC News",http://abcnews.go.com/International/pope-expected-lunch-gay-hiv-positive-transgender-prisoners/story?id=29786524,"Pope Francis will reportedly lunch Saturday with gay, transgender and HIV positive prison inmates as part of a day trip to Southern Italy.

The Italian news site Vatican Insider reported the pontiff will lunch with about 90 prisoners, including 10 from a prison ward that houses those inmates. The report said the prisoners won their spot in a special raffle.

The one-day trip to Naples will also include a visit to the city’s poorest neighborhood, still a stronghold of organized crime.

The visit and luncheon echo one of the central messages of Francis’ papacy. ""Do not be afraid to go and to bring Christ into every area of life, to the fringes of society, even to those who seem farthest away, most indifferent,"" Francis said in 2013.

Francis, Vatican watchers say, continues to reach out to groups who previously felt judged or disenfranchised by the Church.

In February, the Vatican installed bathrooms and showers for the homeless in St. Peter’s Square last month.

Coming back from a gathering in 2013, the pope spoke about homosexuality to reporters. ""If they accept the Lord and have goodwill, who am I to judge them? They shouldn’t be marginalized. The tendency [to homosexuality] is not the problem…they’re our brothers.""

The pope's remarks should not be seen as softening the church's stance on gay marriage, however. In January, Francis criticized “ideological colonization of the family,"" which a Vatican spokesman later confirmed was at least in part a reference to gay marriage.

The trip will include a stop at nearby Pompeii. Plans for fireworks to mark the pope’s visit have been scrubbed as a sign of respect for victims of the recent terrorist attack in Tunisia."

Twenty-five people on board the Air Canada A320 were injured in the hard landing after the jet hit an array antenna on the ground. Considering the considerable damage to the plane, it was fortunate that no one was seriously hurt, officials said.

""They touched down 1,100 feet before the runway,"" Michael Cunningham of the Transportation Safety Board of Canada said. ""I'd say they are pretty lucky.""

The landing gear came off after the plane hit the runway, according to Cunningham, and the plane then skidded another 1,100 feet on its belly before it came to a stop. The passengers were then evacuated, Cunningham said.

""Didn't hesitate -- just jumped out onto the wing, we started running away from the plane,"" passenger Dominic Stettler said.

The underside of the plane suffered significant damage, Cunningham said. The nose cone broke off and one of the plane's two engines detached.

""I was really scared,"" Leon Yu said. ""We slid down a thing, and we saw the engine a couple hundred feet from the plane.""

Of the 25 passengers and crew members who were hospitalized, all but one had been released as of Sunday afternoon, according to Air Canada.

The TSB will have about 12 to 15 investigators at the scene on Monday.

""It's too early to draw any conclusions about this occurrence,"" Cunningham said this afternoon.

The black boxes have been recovered and are heading to Ottawa to be analyzed, Cunningham said.

Halifax Stanfield International Airport spokesman Peter Spurway said the pilots were in control of the plane up until the hard landing.

Spurway said there was snow on the runway but it hadn't yet been determined whether that was a factor in the hard landing. The airport also suffered a power interruption around the same time of the incident, but it was unclear whether the two events were related.

""It was safe to land in this weather,"" said Air Canada Chief Operating Officer Klaus Goersch.

The pilots are 15-year veterans of Air Canada, Goersch added, with ""many years"" of experience flying the A320.

Goersch said that the plane was checked Saturday, which was its most recent scheduled maintenance check.

The airport was closed to all air traffic for several hours after the crash before reopening.

Again, operations are resuming. Expect changes to flight schedules, please check ahead."

Now, with fighting raging once again and hundreds more civilians killed in just the past few weeks, the U.S. is joining major European allies in yet another effort to broker a peace deal in the war-ravaged nation.

Watch the video above to see how the Ukraine crisis got where it is today.

Secretary of State John Kerry is in Kiev, Ukraine, today, where he made clear that the Obama administration wants to de-escalate the situation rather than increase pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is backing the rebels in eastern Ukraine.

“We are not seeking a confrontation with Russia. No-one is,"" Kerry said. ""We are very hopeful that Russia will take advantage of our broad-based, uniform acceptance of the notion that there is a diplomatic solution staring everybody in the face. That is what we want.”

The leaders of Germany and France are in Kiev, as well, and they will fly to Moscow with a new peace proposal in hand --which the U.S. supports.

But the Ukrainian government wants more weapons right now, not more diplomacy. Their troops have been hammered by rebel forces, backed by what they claim are up to 9,000 Russian troops that have invaded their country. They want anti-tank weapons, surveillance drones and night-vision equipment from the U.S. to retake the initiative on the battlefield.

President Obama, however, is wary of deeper military involvement in Ukraine.

Analysts note that the Russian army supporting the rebels is far stronger than the Ukrainian forces, and there are doubts that U.S. aid would make any real difference.

Meanwhile, the people of eastern Ukraine -- on both sides of the front lines -- suffer terribly in a winter war that shows no signs of ending any time soon."

On March 11, Seth's mom, Leanne, posted a video of her son on YouTube asking the world to don his favorite color March 27 to raise awareness of severe combined immunodeficiency disorder (SCID), which he was diagnosed with at 5 months old.

""Basically, he was born with no immune system and has no way of fighting any form of infection,"" she said. ""The only ways those children can survive is having a bone marrow transplant. He had his first one when he was 7 months old, but it tried to fight his body and treat it like it was a virus or infection.""

Lane of Northamptonshire, England, told ABC News Seth must be kept in a sterile room to protect him from germs and bacteria.

In other words, he spends most of his time in a “bubble.”

""It's before bone marrow transplants happen - that’s where the term 'bubble boy' comes from,"" she said. ""They need to stay in a bubble to have any chance of surviving until the bone marrow transplant.

""Even the common cold could lead to death because his body cannot deal with it, but if the transplant is successful, then he can be cured.""

Seth has spent most of his life in and out of hospitals. Although he started school at a normal age, most of his learning has also been inside of a ward.

But despite his health issues, Lane said Seth has been smiling throughout.

""He is the most loving, happy child,"" she said. ""It sounds ironic after what we've been talking about, that I'd just say that. He deals with everything extremely well.

""When we went to the hospital, he said to me, 'I'm not going home for a long time Mummy, am I?' I said, 'No, you’ve got a lot to do here' and he comes to the conclusion that he's just accepted it.""

In a bid to shed awareness on Seth's condition, the Lanes have enlisted folks around the globe to join in wearing the happy hue and share it on the Web using the hashtag #WearYellowForSeth.

""Yellow is Seth's absolute favorite color,"" Lane said. ""He loves anything yellow. If I put a yellow shirt on, he says, “Look, yellow!'

""It perks him up when he's feeling rubbish, really."" she said. ""We said we're going to hang them [photos] all up, but I think there's going to be a lot more pictures than we thought. I think we’ll need a football stadium.”

Lane said that in addition to raising Seth's spirits, she hopes the social campaign will bring attention to SCID.

""It's about raising awareness about how a bone marrow transplant can literally save a life,” she said. “It's not something a lot of people know about it. I didn’t know about it until Seth was diagnosed.

""If more children can get more matches because of this, even if one child can get a match, then that’s fantastic.""

Because of taking antibiotics for years, Seth must have his gallbladder removed sometime next week, his mother said. If all goes well, Seth is scheduled to start chemotherapy in five weeks, then have his second bone marrow transplant eight days later. His father will be his donor.

The Lane family added that they are not looking for any donations. They just want people to share photos of their wearing yellow for Seth today."

Critics say the law could allow businesses to turn away gay and lesbian customers in the name of religious freedom. Indiana Gov. Mike Pence defended the law in a weekend appearance on ABC News' “This Week.”

Pence said he expects a clarification bill to be introduced in the coming week.

“We're not going to change the law,"" he said, ""but if the general assembly in Indiana sends me a bill that adds a section that reiterates and amplifies and clarifies what the law really is and what it has been for the last 20 years, than I'm open to that.""

Pence was adamant that the measure, slated to take effect in July, will stick.

""We're not going to change this law,"" he said.

The law quickly gained national attention after it was signed Thursday. The NCAA, which is based in Indianapolis, released a statement expressing concern that the law would negatively impact athletes and visitors in town for the Final Four games of its men’s basketball tournament.

""The NCAA national office and our members are deeply committed to providing an inclusive environment for all our events,” the NCAA said in a statement. “Moving forward, we intend to closely examine the implications of this bill and how it might affect future events as well as our workforce.""

Final Four action begins Saturday at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis, and will feature Michigan State against Duke and Kentucky facing Wisconsin. The championship game follows on Monday, April 6.

Basketball greats Charles Barkley and Reggie Miller weighed in.

“Discrimination in any form is unacceptable to me,” Barkley said in a statement, expressing the belief that major sports events should not be held in the state.

“I’ve never been big into politics but I’m very disappointed in my adopted home state of Indiana and the passing of Senate Bill 101,"" Miller wrote in a social media post. ""I’ve always been about inclusion for all, no matter your skin color, gender or sexual preference. ... We are all the same people, beautiful creatures.”

pic.twitter.com/21LwD5Ie72

The NBA and WNBA -- along with the Pacers and Fever franchises, which play home games in the state -- also issued a statement.

“The game of basketball is grounded in long established principles of inclusion and mutual respect. We will continue to ensure that all fans, players and employees feel welcome at all NBA and WNBA events in Indiana and elsewhere,” the statement read.

The Twitter hashtag #boycottindiana drew viral attention in recent days, and figures such as Hillary Clinton called the law “sad.” Internet giant Angie’s List canceled a $40 million expansion project in Indiana.

Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO, wrote an op-ed article for The Washington Post about the measure and similar efforts in other states.

“There’s something very dangerous happening in states across the country,” he wrote."
1IfF38u,2015-03-30 00:00:00,"Germanwings Co-Pilot Andreas Lubitz Previously Had Suicidal Thoughts, Prosecutor Says - ABC News",http://abcnews.go.com/International/germanwings-pilot-previously-suicidal-thoughts-prosecutor/story?id=30002894,"Prosecutors in Germany said today that the co-pilot of the downed Germanwings plane had been treated by a psychotherapist because of previous suicidal tendencies.

Dusseldorf prosecutor Christoph Kumpa's update came six days after authorities say Germanwings co-pilot Andreas Lubitz deliberately flew the jetliner into a mountain. Kumpa said that they still do not know the motive of the crash and they have not found a suicide note.

""We have found medical documentation that showed no organic medical illness,"" Kumpa said.

Few details have been revealed about the psychotherapy in question except that it reportedly occurred before Lubitz received his pilots license, which happened in 2013.

Kumpa said that Lubitz continued to see doctors and occasionally took time off for illness, the details of which were not released. A spokesperson for Germanwings acknowledged the prosecutor's statement but would not comment on any of Lubitz' interactions with doctors.

The data and documents that investigators have found, Kumpa said, ""don't show any hint of being suicidical [sic] or being aggressive towards other people.""

He said that nothing that investigators have learned about Lubitz's personal or professional life has given any indication into a motive.

Investigators are focusing on the psychological state of Lubitz, 27, and a 100-person special commission -- dubbed ""Alps"" -- to investigate his life and collece evidence to identify more than 70 German victims. All told, the plane was carrying 150 people including Lubitz, all of whom died.

Germanwings CEO Olivier Wagner, speaking at a press conference in Marseille, called the crash “The saddest day of my life. The families are always asking me, 'Why had this happen?' I cannot give them an answer,” Wagner said.

Authorities have said Lubitz hid evidence of an illness from his employers, including a sick note that was found torn up inside his apartment in Dusseldorf dated from the day of the crash.

Frank Woiton, a Germanwings pilot, told German TV station WDR that he saw nothing unusual about Lubitz when he flew with him less than a month ago.

""The impression that I got was that he was a normal guy,"" Woiton said. ""He had plans for the future. He wanted to fly long distance flights for Lufthansa.""

A Lufthansa spokesman said the FBI has questioned Lufthansa flight trainers in the U.S. who worked with Lubitz at the Airline Training Center in Arizona. The spokesman would not comment on whether the questioning revolved around trying to reconstruct Lubitz's mental state during his time there.

Philip Bramley, the father of one of the victims in the plane crash, said airlines should take better care of their pilots' welfare.

""I believe the airlines should be more transparent and our finest pilots looked after properly,"" Bramley said. ""We put our lives and our children's lives in their hands.""

His 28-year-old son, Paul Bramley, was one of the 150 people killed. Bramley called Lubitz's motive irrelevant while speaking near the site of the crash.

""What is relevant, is that it should never happen again; my son and everyone on that plane should not be forgotten, ever,"" he said.

In addition to the findings suggesting Lubitz was hiding an illness, a search of his apartment in Dusseldorf yielded no suicide note and the city's prosecutor announced that there was no evidence that political or religious factors were involved in the crash.

Officials seized medical documents at Lubitz's home that indicated ""an existing illness and appropriate medical treatment,"" Senior State Prosecutor Ralf Herrenbrueck said in the statement, according to the AP.

Torn up prescriptions and notes from doctors ""support the current preliminary assessment that the deceased hid his illness from his employer and colleagues,"" the statement said, according to the AP.

“This is no hoax,” said Doug Rappaport, the attorney for 29-year-old Denise Huskins. “This is not a laughing matter,”

Huskins turned up unharmed Wednesday, two days after she supposedly was taken for an $8,500 ransom.

Vallejo Police Lt. Kenny Park expressed disappointment in the situation.

Daniel Russo, an attorney for Aaron Quinn, the woman’s boyfriend, told ABC News that there’s plenty of evidence that the kidnappers were real -- and still on the loose.

“These people, they’re really motivated,” Russo said.

The reported evidence includes manifesto-type emails sent both to the San Francisco Chronicle and Quinn’s attorney -- allegedly from the kidnappers -- as well as an audio recording believed to be Huskins.

Russo, who declined to go into specifics, said the evidence proves the couple isn’t lying. He added that there’s good reason why his client waited 10 hours before calling for help: Quinn was tied up and drugged, Russo said.

“If he is accurate about the group of people that did this to him, then they’re on the loose,” Russo said.

Police have questioned both Quinn and Huskins. At this point, law enforcement and the FBI both remain tight-lipped about the ongoing investigation."
1IGvtMO,2015-03-27 00:00:00,Aaron Hernandez Fiancee Shayanna Jenkins Testifies at Murder Trial - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/US/aaron-hernandez-fiancee-shayanna-jenkins-testifies-murder-trial/story?id=29948608,"Aaron Hernandez's fiancee, Shayanna Jenkins, said today in a Massachusetts courtroom that the former New England Patriots star denied involvement in a friend's alleged murder.

Hernandez, 25, is accused of orchestrating Odin Lloyd's slaying June 17, 2013. Prosecutors say Hernandez and two other men picked up Lloyd from his house and brought him to an industrial park near the Patriots' Gillette Stadium. Hernandez has pleaded not guilty.

Jenkins, who was on the stand for four hours today, said that after she found out Lloyd had been killed, she asked Hernandez whether he did it, and he said ""no.""

""That was the extent of our conversation,"" she added.

Jenkins, 25, who was granted immunity in February, was called by the prosecution. Surveillance video previously played for the jury showed Jenkins' removing a garbage bag from their home with what appeared to be a box inside. Prosecutors said before the trial that they believe the box contained the alleged murder weapon, which has never been found.

Court recessed for the day just as prosecutors started asking about the trash bag.

Jenkins and Hernandez were high school sweethearts and have a 2-year-old daughter together.

At the break for lunch, Jenkins walked off the stand, looked at Hernandez and mouthed a quick ""I love you."" Minutes later, she walked across the street and greeted Hernandez's mother and stepfather with a big hug before joining them for lunch.

Court was delayed about an hour this morning about an hour as nine jurors were called into the courtroom individually to be questioned by Judge Susan Garsh. One juror in particular was brought back three times, but it is unknown what was discussed. One juror was dismissed this morning for ""reasons that are personal,"" bringing the number down to 15.

Proceedings were then delayed longer after the defense filed a motion to limit Jenkins' testimony. The result was a session this morning without the jury present during which the prosecution asked her a number of questions to gauge what her testimony would be.

Jenkins said when police came to her home on the evening of June 17, she asked Hernandez what it was about, and he said he didn't know. ""I just asked what was going on and he said he didn't know,"" Jenkins said.

Jenkins then drove Hernandez to the police station. When prosecutors asked whether they had a conversation in the car, Jenkins said ""No.""

""We both had question marks,"" she said this morning. ""We didn't have any further conversation.""

Jenkins said she and Hernandez didn't talk about whether Hernandez and Lloyd were together the night of the alleged murder. She said they also didn't have a conversation about Lloyd's body being found near their home.

Jenkins said there was one gun kept in the home she shared with Hernandez. The gun was stored in the junk drawer in the kitchen, but she said she doesn't remember when she last saw the gun in the drawer.

She took the stand again in the afternoon, this time before the jury, but did not repeat the morning's testimony.

In the afternoon, Jenkins was asked about Hernandez and Lloyd's friendship.

""They were always together when he came over,"" Jenkins said. ""If that isn't friends don't know what is."" The defense has claimed that Hernandez and Lloyd were good friends and Hernandez wouldn't have a reason to kill him.

Jenkins also testified that Hernandez was a frequent marijuana user, an important piece of information for the prosecution because Hernandez's DNA was found on a blunt at the scene of the alleged crime.

Prosecutors also asked Jenkins about her withdrawing $500 to give to Hernandez's friend. Prosecutors have said that the withdrawal was getaway money, and that if Jenkins didn't have immunity, she would have been charged as an accessory.

It's the 12th annual National Wear Red Day, which takes place the first Friday in February to raise awareness for women's heart health. Since 1 in 3 women die of heart disease and stroke every year, the American Heart Association started the day to help spread the word that heart disease is 80 percent preventable.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, heart disease kills 422,000 people a year, but it can be prevented by making healthy lifestyle choices such as not smoking, exercising and eating right.

Recognizing heart attack symptoms can also help -- especially considering the symptoms are a little different for women. Not all women experience the chest pain they've come to expect from a heart attack. Instead, they may feel fatigued, nauseous and have jaw pain.

Six researchers from the University of Buenos Aires and La Plata Museum found the ruins of what is believed to be a hideout in Teyu Cuare Park in northern Argentina near the border with Paraguay, team leader Daniel Schavelzon told ABC News today.

He said they discovered the site years ago, but only began extensive research this month.

During World War II, it's believed the Nazis had a secret project building hideouts in hard-to-find places like desserts, mountains and jungles such as Teyu Cuare, Schavelzon said.

The hideouts where meant to serve as shelters for high-ranking Nazi officers in the event of defeat, he added.

During the past 15 days the team spent at the ruins, they discovered three buildings, a stone quarry and various artifacts from World War II Germany, Schavelzon said.

""We found German coins minted between 1938 and 1944, fragments of a porcelain plate that said it was made in Germany and Nazi symbols and German inscriptions carved into the walls,"" he said. ""It's hard to prove the site was definitely made by the Nazis, but we're working to unearth more evidence to support this hypothesis.""

The believed hideout was covered in thick vines and moss, Schavelzon added.

""It's been very difficult to conduct work there,"" he said. ""Everything is covered in jungle and we have to use knives and machetes to cut through.""

Schavelzon said he doesn't believe Nazis ever inhabited the hideout since it was never needed. Thousands of Nazis were welcomed in Argentina after the war by former president Juan Perón, who led the nation from 1946 to 1955 and for a short while again in the 1970s."

The 200 million-year-old footprints measure about 17 inches wide and are only visible when the tide is low. They were discovered in 1963 by a local engineer and chemist Gilbert Bessonnat.

“This open-air museum of dinosaur footprints counts among the richest we have from the Jurassic era,” local authorities said on the city hall website.

France's National Hydrographic Service was expecting more than 15.3 yards difference between low tide on Saturday afternoon and high tide in the evening.

The trail would have been left by animals measuring between 8-feet 2-inches and 9-feet 10-inches, amateur paleontologists told French TV while visiting the site. A dozen different species are known to have lived on a 26,000-foot tall mountain, now a cliff eroding into a beach."

The post, featuring 13-year-old middle school student Vidal Chastanet from Brownsville, Brooklyn, has received more than 1 million likes on Facebook and more than 145,000 shares.

Chastnet talks to Humans of New York about the person who has influenced him most, Ms. Lopez, his school's principal. Chastanet attends Mott Hall Bridges Academy in Brownsville, Brooklyn, the neighborhood in New York City with the highest crime rate.

""When we get in trouble, she doesn't suspend us. She calls us to her office and explains to us how society was built down around us. And she tells us that each time somebody fails out of school, a new jail cell gets built. And one time she made every student stand up, one at a time, and she told each one of us that we matter,"" Chastanet told Humans of New York.

Their story inspired President Obama, so it was only a matter of time before Chastanet, Nadia Lopez and Brandon Stanton, the Humans of New York creator and photographer, received an invitation to the White House.

The president sat down with the three Thursday, giving them the opportunity to share their inspirational story and let them ask him some personal questions.

The White House posted the video to its YouTube channel Saturday, giving a behind-the-scenes look as Obama met Chastanet and his principal.

The president offered words of encouragement and inspiration in his office. Talking about his mother's influence in his life, Obama detailed her struggle as a single mother.

""She had to work and she went to school. She had to raise me and raise my sister,"" Obama said. ""She had to work, she had to raise kids, it was a victory of her spirit.""

When asked, ""When is the time you felt most broken?"" the president discussed the time when he first ran for Congress in 1999.

""I just got whooped. I got beat. And there was a stretch of time at the age of 40 where I had invested a lot of time and effort and I wasn't sure I had taken the right path. And I think we all go through those stretches,"" he said.

""Usually life is not a straight line. We don't do things alone. Nobody does things alone,"" he said. ""Everybody always needs support. You'll have a lot of people supporting you out there. You just gotta make sure you seize those opportunities.""

The White House said the donations raised for the school will be used to send students to visit Harvard, support summer programs and provide scholarships to students."

It was the same house where Lanza began his December 2012 rampage by killing his mother before driving to Sandy Hook Elementary School, killing 20 children and six adults before shooting himself.

Manafort Brothers of Plainville, Connecticut, volunteered to carry out the demolition. Contractors arrived on site Monday “and had the house down within two hours,” Newtown First Selectman Pat Llodra told ABC News. The contractors completed the project today by tearing down the foundation and ripping up the driveway.

The town will return to the 2+ acre site on Yogananda Street this spring to grade the land and do whatever plantings are appropriate. The goal is to return the land to a natural state. The lot backs up to open space so the hope is it merges “into the existing open space in a very natural way,” Llodra said.

Manafort Brothers also demolished the house in Cheshire, Connecticut, where Dr. William Petit’s wife and two daughters were killed by home intruders in 2007.

“We’ve been treated so well by so many companies but I thought it was so incredible to learn the Manafort company stepped up in Cheshire and now in Newtown,” Llodra said.

Elsewhere in town the new Sandy Hook elementary is going up. Foundation work started last week.

“Each of these events are small steps but the combination of all of them is important to us,” Llodra said."
1Itpuu5,2015-04-02 00:00:00,Memories Pizza in Indiana Gets Thousands in Donations After Saying It Won't Cater Gay Wedding - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Business/memories-pizza-indiana-thousands-donations-cater-gay-wedding/story?id=30064109,"Donations are pouring in for operators of a pizza restaurant in Indiana driven into hiding by angry protests and threats after they said they would refuse to cater a gay wedding.

The owners of Memories Pizza in Walkerton, Indiana, near the border with Michigan, told ABC News' South Bend, Indiana, affiliate WBND that they don't support gay marriage because of their religious beliefs. Co-owner Crystal O'Connor said the restaurant, a ""Christian establishment,"" would be willing to serve gay or lesbian customers who walk in, just not a wedding.

The comments came after the Religious Freedom Restoration Act was recently signed into law by Gov. Mike Pence that prohibits state and local government from ""substantially"" burdening someone's religious beliefs without a ""compelling"" interest. Legislators today are debating a change to the law that would prevent businesses from discriminating based on sexual orientation or other factors.

Since the restaurant's story went viral this week, supporters and critics have flooded the Internet. Critical online comments have swamped the restaurant's Yelp page and the local police department said it completed an investigation into a threat on Twitter to ""burn down"" the restaurant.

""We encourage all to follow Indiana laws and statutes,"" assistant chief of police Charles Kulp said in a statement on Wednesday. ""We ask that all frustrations and rebuttals with Memories Pizza’s recent media statements remain within the law.""

Meanwhile, a GoFundMe page launched on Wednesday to support the restaurant had raised $226,000 as of Thursday afternoon. Lawrence Jones, a contributor to the show ""Dana,"" hosted by Dana Loesch on Glenn Beck's TheBlaze, started the fundraising page to coincide with O'Connor's phone interview on the show Wednesday.

""This is us as America,"" Jones told ABC News. ""When Americans are attacked for their voice, we get behind that. We created this GoFundMe and our hope is to raise as much money, to give them every penny so they can survive.""

In her interview with The Blaze, O'Connor reiterated her stance that she would serve ""anyone that walked in that door, even gays,"" but that she did ""not condone a [gay] wedding.""

“I don’t know if we will re-open, or if we can, if it’s safe to re-open,” O’Connor said, according to TheBlaze.com. “We’re in hiding basically, staying in the house.”

The O'Connor family, which WBND said has owned Memories Pizza for nine years, did not respond to ABC News' requests for further comment. The phone went unanswered at Memories Pizza when ABC News called.

Kulp said the department completed an investigation into a comment on Twitter that stated, “Who’s going to Walkerton with me to burn down Memories Pizza."" That Twitter account for a high school coach no longer exists.

The department submitted a report to the St. Joseph County Prosecutors office ""for possible charging of harassment, intimidation, and threats,"" Kulp wrote in his statement.

The prosecutor's office told ABC News this morning that it was still reviewing the police report.

The Concord Community Schools district said the coach of the high school, about 38 miles away from the restaurant, was suspended without pay pending a district investigation.

""That feed is followed by many Concord High School students, including athletes on her teams,"" the district said on its website. ""The promotion of illegal and violent conduct by one of its employees is a serious matter that Concord Community Schools must address and appropriately discipline.""

Due to threats on the restaurant, Kulp tells the South Bend Tribune that patrols of the business “will go on as long as threats continue to be made."""

The Airbus crashed Tuesday in the Alps in southern France with 150 people on board, including two babies, the airline confirmed.

Recovery operations were suspended last night in France, with the intention of starting again today at daybreak.

A French Interior Ministry spokesperson said that bodies and debris would be brought down from the crash site this morning.

The crash took place in a remote part of the French Alps. French President Francois Hollande said there are ""apparently no survivors.""

The airline, a subsidiary of Lufthansa, said it cancelled seven flights Tuesday because crew members reported they were unfit to fly following the tragedy.

The passenger jet, an Airbus A320, crashed near the town of Digne as it traveled from Barcelona to Dusseldorf. The plane was carrying 144 passengers -- including 2 babies -- and six crew members, Germanwings CEO Thomas Winkelmann said at a news conference Tuesday.

One black box has been recovered, according to a spokesman for the French Interior Ministry. That box was en route to the Bureau d'Enquêtes et d'Analyses, the French authority in a Paris suburb responsible for safety investigations in civil aviation, authorities said.

Winkelmann said he feels ""deep sorrow,"" adding that the victims' families will be informed before a list of names will be released. The list of nationalities of the casualties will be released as soon as the airline is certain, Winkelmann added.

Hollande said, ""I want to express my solidarity to the family of the victims. We do not yet know the identities of the victims. It is a mourning we have to go through because it is a tragedy that has happened on our soil.""

Spanish King Felipe IV, who is in France for a pre-scheduled meeting with Hollande, said the passengers were German, Spanish and Turkish.

Germanwings said 67 Germans were on board. The State Department is reviewing whether there were any Americans on board.

King Felipe had planned to stay in France for three days but now said he is returning to Madrid to launch a crisis center.

The cause of the crash has not yet been determined, the Germanwings CEO said. The French Interior Ministry said the plane's black box has been found and that it will be analyzed in the coming hours.

Lufthansa, which owns Germanwings, called the crash ""an accident.""

""For the time being we are calling this an accident,"" a Lufthansa official said at a news conference in Barcelona Tuesday. ""Everything else is speculation.""

The Vatican said Pope Francis sent a telegram expressing his sadness over the crash, and adding that he is praying for the victims and their families.

At a White House news conference, President Obama offered his thoughts and prayers to the people of Germany and Spain, saying, ""American stands with them at this moment of sorrow.""

Obama said he has called German Chancellor Angela Merkel and hopes to speak with Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy of Spain to ""express the condolences of the American people"" and to offer U.S. assistance as they investigate this ""awful tragedy.""

""Our teams are in close contact, and we're working to confirm how many Americans may have been on board,"" Obama said.

Lufthansa released a statement Tuesday as reports emerged of the crash.

""If our fears are confirmed, this is a dark day for Lufthansa. We hope to find survivors,"" Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr said in the statement.

""...on 4U 9525. If our fears are confirmed, this is a dark day for Lufthansa. We hope to find survivors."" Carsten Spohr 2/2

Germanwings and Lufthansa have also darkened their logos on social media.

The plane was flying at 38,000 feet -- its normal cruising altitude -- when it started to lose altitude and descended for 8 minutes, according to Germanwings. When the plane was at 6,000 feet, it lost contact with French radar.

Lufthansa said the plane went into operation in 1990. It was sold to Lufthansa in 1991 and then sold to Germanwings in 2014.

1ItwQOR,2015-03-24 00:00:00,Top Homeland Official Alejandro Mayorkas Accused of Political Favoritism - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/US/top-homeland-official-alejandro-mayorkas-accused-political-favoritism/story?id=29868429,"Deputy Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas tainted the image and integrity of the immigration program he oversaw by fostering “an appearance of favoritism and special access” in how the agency treated projects that would bring visas and Green Cards to wealthy foreign investors, a new report from the agency’s Inspector General says.

“The juxtaposition of Mr. Mayorkas’ communication with external stakeholders on specific matters outside the normal procedures, coupled with favorable action that deviated from the regulatory scheme designed to ensure fairness and evenhandedness in adjudicating benefits, created an appearance of favoritism and special access,” the Inspector General’s report concluded.

At the time the Office of Inspector General launched the probe, Mayorkas was head of a program known as EB-5, which offered a path to Green Cards to foreign investors willing to put $500,000 into a job-creating U.S. business – a program whose popularity exploded under his stewardship.

Similar issues within the immigration program were the focus of an ABC News investigation that aired last month, which found that officials in the Department of Homeland Security had ignored pointed warnings from federal agents and approved visas for immigrants suspected of having committed fraud, money laundering, and even one applicant with alleged ties to a child porn website. Several of those cases involved investment projects whose executives had sought and received help from powerful political figures to lobby Mayorkas for support.

Five different Homeland Security whistleblowers spoke with ABC News about a range of cases where visas were approved despite numerous red flags. They said objections were often ignored because the immigration program is so popular within the Obama Administration and with members of Congress from both parties. As the EB-5 visa program has grown in popularity, the programs critics have become increasingly concerned about the administration’s failure to adequately address abuses that have continued to surface.

“It is shocking,” Sen. Charles Grassley, an Iowa Republican said at the time. “Particularly when you have F.B.I. and other law enforcement agencies that are saying national security could be compromised or is being compromised -- that's enough for us to be concerned.”

Within minutes of the report’s formal release, Homeland Security Sec. Jeh Johnson released a statement defending Mayorkas, but also acknowledging “there are lessons to be learned from the Inspector General’s report – by Ali, and all of us who are leaders in public service.”

“Each of us in leadership must be mindful that, when we become involved in individual matters that happen to reach our desk, we risk the appearance of preferential treatment and the suspicion of our subordinates,” Johnson said. “As public servants, we must maintain the trust and confidence of all those around us, and be above reproach. I have discussed this with Deputy Secretary Mayorkas and I am confident he understands this.”

Mayorkas turned down requests from ABC News to be interviewed about the program, and hustled away from the camera when he was approached to talk about it during a public event in Washington late last year.

In response to the report, he released a statement saying that he inherited an EB-5 program that was “badly broken” and sought to fix it.

“While I disagree with the Inspector General’s report, I will certainly learn from it and from this process,” he said.

Concerns about the agency and Mayorkas’s stewardship have simmered for years. When he was promoted to Deputy Secretary, Republican senators took the unusual step of boycotting his confirmation hearing, complaining that he should not be approved until the ongoing investigation into his conduct by the Inspector General was completed. The hearings went forward without the Republican committee members, and he was ultimately confirmed.

During the confirmation hearings, Mayorkas called allegations of impropriety ""unequivocally false.""

""I say it unequivocally, and I say it after 16 years of service to this country: I have never, ever in my career exercised undue influence to [change] the outcome of a case,"" Mayorkas told a Senate panel. ""I have never based my decisions on who brings a case, but rather upon the facts of the law.""

Rep. Jason Chaffetz, the Utah Republican who chairs the House Oversight & Government Reform Committee said the Inspector General’s findings were “highly concerning.”

“In an unprecedented move, Mr. Mayorkas was confirmed by the Senate on a party-line vote led by Senator Reid, despite being under investigation for his management of USCIS and the EB-5 investor visa program,” Chaffetz said. “This report confirms the concerns surrounding Mr. Mayorkas' suitability for the position were well founded. “

The Inspector General report released Tuesday said investigators had interviewed 15 whistleblowers, a group that included “very senior” department officials and attorneys “who each had direct contact with Mr. Mayorkas and were in a position to witness the events.”

“Each conveyed the same factual scenario,” the report said. “Certain applicants and stakeholders received preferential access to DHS leadership and preferential treatment in either the handling of their application or petition or regarding the merits of the application or petition… Many witnesses provided emails, written contemporaneously with the events, to support their allegations of special access and treatment.”

The report said that investigators interviewed Mayorkas, and he told them that each time he intervened in an EB-5 case, he did so “to improve the EB-5 process or to prevent error.”

“He took a hands-on approach when a case warranted his personal involvement,” the report says. “Mr. Mayorkas told us that his sole motivation for such involvement was to strengthen the integrity of the program; he said he had no interest in whether a particular application or petition was approved.”

One of the projects studied in the report – the electric car start-up venture once overseen by McAuliffe and supported by Rodham – has already proven to be politically combustible.

The immigrant funding became fodder for attacks on McAuliffe during his 2013 run for governor. McAuliffe was accused by political opponents of trying to prod Mayorkas and later then-Sec. Janet Napolitano to approve visas for investors more quickly. He denied, however, that he sought undue influence. Rodham oversaw the EB-5 financing aspect of the business through a separate venture, called Gulf Coast Funds Management Regional Center. He also emailed Mayorkas in a push to speed up processing of immigrant visas, the report says.

ABC News provided a copy of the report to McAuliffe’s press office and sought comment and has not yet received a response. Messages left for Rodham have not been returned.

When it appeared the electric car venture was headed for a denial, “Mr. Mayorkas told his staff that he wanted to review the decision…” the report says. “Many EB-5 officials found this highly unusual because past USCIS Directors typically had not scrutinized individual decisions; they found this level of scrutiny unsettling.”

During one meeting to discuss the electric car venture, the report says Mayorkas intervened directly in the decision making process, “saying he would rewrite the decision himself.”

“One meeting participant said that ‘everyone froze’ when Mr. Mayorkas said, ‘Let me take it home and rewrite the report,’” the report says. “The participant was ‘stunned’ by Mr. Mayorkas’ suggestion, saying ‘the entire turn of events made me extremely uncomfortable.’ Another participant told us the request made it appear that Mr. Mayorkas was dictating the results, which ‘looked bad.’ Ultimately, the participants dissuaded Mr. Mayorkas from rewriting the decision himself.”

Mayorkas provided the Inspector General’s office with a detailed response, in which he defended his actions.

“I was vigilant in guarding against any appearance of impropriety,” he wrote. “I consistently and systematically consulted with USCIS attorneys about my communications. I consistently and systematically shared the communications with them. I actively sought their counsel and the advice of others. Not once do I recall being advised to proceed differently.”

Supporters of Mayorkas dismissed the report as a political attack.

Jim Pasco, the executive director of the Fraternal Order of Police called him “a man of impeccable integrity” and “the inspector general’s office has squandered two and a half years on an investigation and couldn’t come up with something substantive and had to say something.”

Investigators said they could not determine Mayorkas’s motivations.

“Each of these decisions was legitimately within his purview, and we take no position as to the wisdom of any of these actions,” the report said. “However, the complaints we heard were not simply policy-based disagreement[s] … Rather, they centered on his actions that appeared to give special access and special consideration to a small group of applicants and stakeholders.”

The Inspector General's office initially began investigating Mayorkas after having already taking an earlier look at growing concerns about the risk of political influence infecting a program. In a December 2013 audit, the office suggested such perceptions may have been unavoidable, concluding, ""Outside influence may require USCIS senior leadership to become involved in the EB-5 adjudication process, thereby creating the perception of special treatment and internal influence by senior managers.""

But internal Homeland Security documents obtained by ABC News as part of the February report showed that the program has become a magnet for those seeking to sidestep the scrutiny of the traditional immigration process.

In one case, immigration officials pushed through a visa application from Chinese investor in a Las Vegas hotel project despite an internal review that found the investor had previously been turned back at the border, and much of his visa application had likely been fabricated, immigration records show.

A Feb. 1, 2013 Homeland Security internal review obtained by ABC News also lays out in stark detail the breadth of the troubles afflicting some of the roughly 600 so-called regional centers -- private sector entities certified by Homeland Security to recruit foreign investors for specific business ventures that will qualify for EB-5 visas. The document summarizes 41 investigations, some open and some now closed, into allegations ranging from espionage to fraud to drug trafficking involving investors in various EB-5 investment projects.

One regional center, run by an Iranian-born businessman living in Beverly Hills was approved to raise roughly $25 million in investment money from foreign sources even when one of his businesses was being raided by agents. Federal officials told ABC News the businessman is suspected of allegedly smuggling banned items to Iran.

Another regional center raised money from Chinese investors to finance the construction of federal buildings, including an FBI headquarters building in San Diego, raising what one internal document called “national security concerns” that “pertain to Chinese investors having visibility to FBI blueprints/information.”

Advocates for the program also acknowledged the visa program had suffered from occasional failures. But they touted the numerous successful projects that have been financed through this form of foreign investment, and credit it for spurring job growth through some of the toughest years of the shaky economy.

“I don't think we should let a few anecdotes cast a cloud over an entire industry,” Peter Joseph, executive director of the Association to Invest in the U.S.A., told ABC News at the time.

Joseph noted the program is now so popular that the 10,000 visas allotted in 2014 for EB-5 investors were claimed in a matter of months, and he is lobbying for its expansion. The money has paid for popular projects -- a Brooklyn basketball arena, a California winery, a Vermont ski lodge, even a Hollywood movie studio – that have supported an estimated 42,000 jobs.

“It's a win for the investor, who's seeking to get an immigration benefit, along with a return on their investment, along with the American worker who's able to get to work, thanks to the capital investment coming through the program,” Joseph said.

But in his statement, DHS Secretary Johnson said he now recognizes the EB-5 program is suffering from significant problems.

“Though the EB-5 program is a popular tool for economic development and investment in this country, I have ongoing concerns about the program,” Johnson said.

He said DHS officials have been peppered by members of congress and other outsiders from both parties seeking help with EB-5 approvals.

“I am directing the creation of a new protocol to ensure that the EB-5 program is free from the reality or perception of improper outside influence,” he said.

“The EB-5 regional center program is up for statutory renewal again this year,” he added. “I urge Congress to work with the Department to strengthen the security and integrity of the program.”

1IUAPE4,2015-04-03 00:00:00,Two ISIS-Inspired Women Arrested in NYC for Allegedly Trying to Build Bomb - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/US/isis-inspired-women-arrested-nyc-allegedly-build-bomb/story?id=30064961,"Federal authorities have arrested two women who were allegedly planning to detonate a bomb somewhere in the United States after being radicalized at least in part by ISIS, sources familiar with the arrests told ABC News.

The public was never in danger, as it was all part of a lengthy undercover FBI operation. And court documents suggest any plotting was more aspirational than operational.

However, court documents cite direct connections to known or suspected terrorists inside the United States and overseas.

In August 2014, 28-year-old Noelle Velentzas became Facebook friends with Tairod Pugh, a U.S. Air Force veteran indicted two weeks ago for his own ISIS-inspired plans. Meanwhile, 31-year-old Asia Siddiqui ""has had repeated contact with members of"" Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the Yemen-based terrorist group behind several bomb plots targeting U.S.-bound planes.

Both were arrested earlier today without incident in Queens, N.Y., where they had been roommates until recently.

In meetings with an undercover FBI agent in recent months, Velentzas and Siddiqui allegedly discussed efforts to learn the “science” involved in building explosives, often analyzing previous bomb plots inside the U.S. -- failed ones and successful ones, like the Oklahoma City bombing. In addition, they downloaded ""The Anarchist Cookbook"" and watched videos about building bombs, court documents allege.

Also in meetings with the undercover FBI agent, Velentzas expressed anger over U.S. airstrikes targeting ISIS in Syria and Iraq, and she suggested she and Siddiqui be referred to as ""citizens of the Islamic State,"" according to charging documents. She also allegedly watched ISIS propaganda videos with the undercover agent.

Two weeks ago, after news broke about Pugh's arrest, she said she didn't understand why people wanted to join ISIS overseas when there are ways of “pleasing Allah” here in the United States, court documents say.

She allegedly said she was looking ""to make history,"" and in late December she and the FBI agent discussed possible targets for a bombing.

""We are living ... the last war, the big war before the end of day starts, in English they call it Armageddon, we are actually living in that time, it’s not a joke, it starts in Syria,"" she allegedly told the undercover agent.

Meanwhile, unbeknownst to Velentzas or the undercover agent, Siddiqui had acquired what she later described as ""everything,"" including four propane tanks. She also downloaded instructions on how to those tanks in building a bomb, according to court documents.

In fact, authorities say nine years earlier, Siddiqui ""became close with Samir Khan,"" the American who joined AQAP and then became editor of Inspire magazine, the terrorist group's online propaganda magazine. Khan published the article “Make a Bomb in the Kitchen of Your Mom,” which has since played a prominent role in so many terror plots, including the Boston bombing.

It’s unclear exactly why the two were arrested this morning. But court documents say Siddiqui ""recently” suggested they each work on their own plans for jihad. And in November, Velentzas became suspicious that they may be working with an undercover agent. She then conducted research online, trying to determine whether the person they were dealing with was actually any FBI agent, court documents say.

Such arrests tied to ISIS have become a regular occurrence recently.

Last week, two cousins were arrested in Chicago -- one of them a current member of the Illinois National Guard -- for allegedly trying to launch attacks in the U.S. and overseas on behalf of ISIS. They were also nabbed in an FBI undercover operation, and both men had been under FBI surveillance for months, federal authorities said.

The week before, the indictment against New Jersey native Pugh, 47, was announced. He had been living overseas for years but was secretly arrested three months ago after being deported back to the United States. On his laptop, FBI agents allegedly discovered more than 180 jihadist propaganda videos and noticed he had been conducting online searches for such phrases as ""borders controlled by Islamic state,"" ""kobani border crossing,"" and ""who controls kobani.""

Two months ago, three New York City men were arrested on charges they allegedly conspired to join ISIS but also expressed willingness to carry out attacks on the terror group's behalf in the United States. The men had planned to travel to the Middle East and had also pledged to launch attacks in this country, including one on President Obama or planting a bomb in Coney Island, Brooklyn, federal officials said.

Over the past 18 months, more than 30 people have been charged with joining terrorist groups in Syria and Iraq or trying to do so.

1IUEZQd,2015-02-12 00:00:00,'American Sniper' Trial: Widow Taya Kyle Cries on Witness Stand - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/US/american-sniper-trial-widow-taya-kyle-cries-witness/story?id=28893252,"The widow of ""American Sniper"" Chris Kyle could tell something was wrong when he spoke to her by phone from a Texas gun range shortly before he was shot and killed, she testified in court today.

Taya Kyle started to get worried when her husband didn't respond to a subsequent text message, and she said she learned her husband had been killed when a police officer showed up at her house shortly afterwards.

Pausing at points to wipe away tears during the first day of testimony in her husband's murder trial, Taya Kyle told the court, ""I'm not nervous. I'm just emotional.""

Eddie Ray Routh, now 27, the man accused of murdering Chris Kyle, 38, and Chad Littlefield, 35, Kyle's longtime friend, took notes throughout Taya Kyle's testimony.

#snipertrial Very difficult. Taya says she talked to Chris from range. Could tell he was irritated by something. pic.twitter.com/WclnF4imI5

Kyle said that her husband had never met Routh before Feb. 2, 2013, the day that they went to the Rough Creek Lodge gun range in Glen Rose, Texas, and he had decided to meet with him at the urging of Routh's mother.

Since retiring from the military in 2009, Kyle, who is recognized as the deadliest sniper in American military history, worked with veterans and regularly brought them to gun ranges.

Taya Kyle said that her husband believed that a week spent outdoors was more beneficial than a week in a hospital.

The 40-year-old mother of two, the first witness called in Routh's murder trial, revealed that Kyle, himself, had some difficulty adjusting to civilian life after a career spent largely overseas, noting that he drank and had night sweats. He eventually began to put on a little weight but he ""still looked great,"" she said in court.

Testifying later was Chad Littlefield's mother, Judy Littlefield, who appeared so overcome with emotion that, at first, she seemed barely able to speak.

If her son was alive, she said, today would have been his 38th birthday. He was ""a very good son,"" she added, noting that he called to check on her every day.

#snipertrial Judy Littlefield, Chad's mom. He would have been 38 today. She can barely say it's birthday. pic.twitter.com/Z2h6tniTd3

""Chad didn't talk much but was always watching to make sure people were safe,"" Judy Littlefield said.

She added that her son was not a veteran and first met Kyle when they were on the sidelines of their kids' soccer game.

The decision to have the women testify so early in the trial came largely because the judge ruled that no witnesses can be in the courtroom until after they have testified so they will not be affected by other testimony.

The trial began this morning with opening arguments from both sides, with District Attorney Alan Nash detailing Routh's alleged actions on the day of the shooting and defense attorney Tim Moore setting up his planned insanity defense. Routh faces life in prison if he is found guilty.

After both women finished their testimony, the manager of the shooting range, Frank Alvarez, told the court about the moment he was called to the range and saw people trying to resuscitate Kyle and Littlefield.

The prosecutor then began showing photos of the crime scene, including one that showed Kyle's dead body, during which Taya Kyle was seen shaking her head.

The man who first found Kyle and Littlefield's bodies, a responding police officer and a paramedic from the local fire department all testified this afternoon."
1Iy7saL,2015-03-25 00:00:00,Why Legendary Bodybuilder Who Died With Almost Zero Body Fat Lives On - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Health/legendary-bodybuilder-died-body-fat-lives/story?id=29899438,"Austrian bodybuilder Andreas Munzer, who died 19 years ago this month, remains both the gold standard and a cautionary tale for men striving for the ripped, lean look the sport demands.

Although it could not be confirmed, he appears to have died from multiple organ failure, the likely result of years of alleged anabolic steroid abuse. He was 31, and easily recognizable from the images that have gone viral in recent days.

Munzer’s autopsy revealed he had almost 0 percent body fat, the legend goes. Such a small amount of body fat could have hastened his demise, experts say.

“You need body fat for cellular function, energy use and to pad the joints and organs,” said Carol Garber, professor of movement sciences at Columbia University in New York City. “Having too little can lead to nutritional deficiencies, electrolyte imbalances and malfunction of the heart, kidney and other organs.”

Men require at least 3 percent body fat and women at least 12 percent in order for the body to function properly, Garber said. Below that is where you start to see serious health problems. Sometimes it leads to organ failure and death, she added.

But despite the risks, Munzer’s pictures and profile frequently go viral on bodybuilding forums all these years later because of the sports’ perpetual obsession with stripping every last ounce of adipose tissue from their body, according to Brian Washington, commissioner of the United States Bodybuilding Federation.

“Percentage of body fat is a major issue with bodybuilders,” Washington said. “They devote a lot of their efforts and money on products to go as low as they can possibly go.”

Others agree.
“There are still some bodybuilders obsessed about their numbers who take their body fat percentage readings on a regular basis readers,” said Louis Zwick, the producer of Musclemania, a bodybuilding and fitness competition production company, adding that even those who don’t care about an exact percentage do care about getting as ripped as possible for competition.

Zwick, who said he was part of the film crew that taped Münzer’s last competition before his death 10 days later, said the Austrian was very lean but doubts his body was completely absent of fat.

“I’ve never really seen anyone who really had zero body fat,” he said. “You just can’t be. You wouldn’t survive.”

But it is possible to get down to so little body fat it becomes unmeasurable by standard methods, Columbia’s Garber said. Pinching the skin to measure the thickness of fat just below the surface is the most common way of measuring body fat percentage, she said. It wouldn’t be precise enough to estimate the degree of accuracy needed to make such a claim, she said.

The average bodybuilder is probably between 3 and 5 percent body fat, at least during competition season, Musclemania producer Zwick estimated. Some cycle up in weight during the off-season but as the sport has moved toward a more natural look in the past decade, many strive to stay in shape all year long, he said.

Munzer, Zwick said, was leaner than most. He was always muscled up and stripped of fat.

“That’s why he’s still a legend today,” he said."
1IyvPoB,2015-03-26 00:00:00,Germanwings Co-Pilot Appeared to Want to 'Destroy the Plane': Prosecutor - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/US/germanwings-pilot-appeared-destroy-plane-prosecutor/story?id=29918529,"The co-pilot of the Germanwings plane that crashed in the French Alps this week appeared to want to ""destroy the plane,"" Brice Robin, public prosecutor of Marseille, said today.

""The intention was to destroy the plane,"" he said, later adding: ""Death was instantaneous.""

Speaking at a news conference conducted mostly in French, Robin confirmed reports about the pilot being heard on the voice recorder asking co-pilot Andreas Lubitz, a German citizen, to take over the controls, with a chair heard being moved and door heard closing.

The co-pilot, 27, took control, Robin said, and the accelerated descent was made manually.

Whatever Lubitz's motivation, Germamwings initially took exception to the prosecutor's comments, tweeting this morning, ""We are shocked by the statements from French authorities that the co-pilot deliberately crashed the aircraft.""

But at a news conference later in Cologne, Carsten Spohr, CEO of Lufthansa, which owns Germanwings, said, “We have to accept that the plane was crashed on purpose.” He added, “It seems to be true that the co-pilot denied the pilot access to the cockpit.”

He asked people not to rush to judgment, however, which he called ""speculation"" about the co-pilot's intentions, adding, ""the motivation could be of various nature.""

He stressed that the co-pilot, who had 630 hours of flying time, had undergone extensive psychological and aviation review since beginning training in 2008 and joining the company as a first officer in 2013, though his training was interrupted six years ago for an unspecified reason.

""In our worst nightmare, we could not have imagined that such a tragedy could take place at our company,"" Spohr said, speaking in German and agreeing with French authorities that terrorism was not involved.

When asked by a reporter whether this was a case of suicide, he declined to characterize it as such, saying, “I’m not a lawyer or a legal person, and I don’t want to speculate.”

He then added: “If a human takes 149 people to death with him, I will not call that suicide.”

As for the chain of events, prosecutor Robin said all had seemed normal as the pilots communicated in a ""jovial"" way for the first 20 minutes of the flight.

But later, the captain can be heard on the voice recording knocking on the door and asking over the speaker to re-enter the cockpit, but there was no response from the co-pilot, Robin said.

The co-pilot can be heard breathing until the moment of impact, Robin said, so officials believe he was alive until the crash in which all 150 people on board are presumed to have died.

Air traffic control can also be heard calling, with no response from the cockpit.

Lubitz, who lived in Montabaur, Germany, had no reason to lock the pilot out of the cabin, no reason not to respond to air traffic control and no reason to disable the plane's ability to maintain contact with other plans in the area, Robin said.

Toward the end of the descent, investigators can hear ""violent"" banging on door as the pilot tries to get in, Robin added.

Lufthansa CEO Spohr said pilots are able to enter a code to re-enter the cockpit but that the pilot inside is able to disable the system electronically. So either the captain did not enter the code or Lubitz blocked his entry, he said. ""It is a puzzle for us,"" he said.

Spohr added, however, ""We have total confidence in our pilots and co-pilots.""

The German Interior Ministry told ABC News there is no evidence that Lubitz had a connection to terror, noting that the ministry is also working closely with the Dusseldorf prosecutor, who has launched an investigation into the matter.

Editor’s note: A French prosecutor initially said Lubitz was 28 years old but a law enforcement official later determined that he was 27.

1Iyz4fR,2015-03-27 00:00:00,Andreas Lubitz: What We Know About the Co-Pilot - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/International/germanwings-crash-pilot/story?id=29919574,"The co-pilot who was at the controls of the Germanwings plane that crashed in the French Alps this week had logged relatively few hours, at least by U.S. standards, prior to the fatal flight.

He has been identified by French authorities as German citizen Andreas Lubitz, 27, and his actions in the final minutes of the flight are believed to have caused the crash, Brice Robin, Public Prosecutor of Marseille, said Thursday at a news conference.

“The intention was to destroy the plane,"" Robin said, speaking mostly in French.

French Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said that investigators are focused on Lubitz' background and motives, though they have started to rule out any connection to a larger plot.

""There is no evidence of any kind terrorist background,"" de Maiziere said in a statement released Thursday.

Lubitz was a member of a flight club called Luftsportclub Westerwald in his hometown of Montabaur, Germany.

""Andreas joined the club as an adolescent, he wanted to make his dream of flying come true,"" the club said in a statement released to ABC News.

""He was able to realize his dream, the dream he now has paid for so dearly with his own life,"" the statement said.

An airline spokeswoman said Lubitz had 630 hours of flight experience and only 100 of those hours were on this particular model of plane, an Airbus A320. By comparison, a U.S. first officer would be required to have at least 1,500 hours of experience to get hired by an airline.

Investigators have been able to listen to the audio recording from inside the cockpit and the captain can be heard leaving the cockpit and then tapping on the door to re-enter but being denied, Robin said.

The banging on the door grows louder while the co-pilot can be heard breathing throughout, he added, suggesting he was not incapacitated before the Tuesday crash that left 150 people dead.

Robin said the co-pilot had no reason not to allow the captain back into the cockpit and he should not have gone silent on the radio to air traffic control.

""When you commit suicide, you die alone,” Robin said in response to a question. “With 150 on the plane, I wouldn't call that suicide.”

Editor’s note: A French prosecutor initially said Lubitz was 28 years old but a law enforcement official later determined that he was 27."

The report delivered strong criticism of the way Defense Department installations in Afghanistan managed their waste disposal systems -- mistakes which were both expensive and may have exposed U.S. military personnel to significant health risks.

“DOD did not adequately plan for and manage disposal of solid waste at its installations in Afghanistan,” the report reads, calling the approach to waste disposal “haphazard and reactive.”

Throughout its engagement in Afghanistan, U.S. military personnel in the country generated hundreds of tons of solid waste per day, including plastics, food waste, electronic equipment and other products. For years, without proper policies or procedures in place, simple open-air burn pits remained the military’s preferred method for disposing of solid waste.

But the toxic smoke of those open-air burn pits, often contaminated with lead and mercury, posed serious health risks of service members and civilians in their immediate area, SIGAR said. U.S. military personnel returning from Afghanistan complained of health problems, which they said stemmed from exposure to the burn pits on installations.

By August 2010, 251 of these open-air burn pits were in operation on U.S. military bases, according to the SIGAR report.

New regulations from U.S. Central Command ordered long-term military bases to install alternative methods, such as incinerators, to provide a safer way of disposing of waste. The military spent over $81 million to install 23 incinerator systems at nine military installations in Afghanistan.

But the SIGAR report said four military bases—FOB Salerno, FOB Sharana, FOB Ghazni and FOB Maywand—never used their eight incinerators, which cost $20.1 million to build. At one of those bases, FOB Sharana, a design error left the loading area too narrow to even allow forklifts to deposit waste in the 40-ton capacity incinerator. FOB Sharana officials decided to continue using open-air burn pits.

“Given the fact that DOD has been aware for many years of the significant health risks associated with open-air burn pits, it is indefensible that U.S. military personnel, who are already at risk of serious injury and death when fighting the enemy, were put at further risk from the potentially harmful emissions from the use of open-air burn pits,” said John F. Sopko, the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction in an introductory letter to the report.

The report also strongly criticized the management of contracts for the construction and maintenance of the incinerators.

“[W]e found occasions where contractors were paid the full contract amount, even though they failed to perform in accordance with contract requirements,” the report reads.

The report found that incinerators at FOB Salerno and FOB Sharana had major deficiencies when they were transferred to the bases. The report states that in both of those cases, the Defense Department paid the contractors the full amount, approximately $10.4 million, without the deficiencies being corrected."

The pod of 198 pilot whales stranded themselves at Farewell Spit, an area that's known as a ""deathtrap"" for marine mammals, conservation officials told the AFP. If volunteers fail to re-float whales today, the workers have to wait 24 hours for another high tide.

""Re-floating stranded whales is a difficult and potentially dangerous job. ... Community group Project Jonah has 140 volunteers in the Golden Bay area who are trained to do this and we’re working alongside them,"" New Zealand Department of Conservation spokesman Andrew Lamason told the AFP.

While the whales are beached, they can suffer from dehydration and sunburn.

Detroit born and bred. An Army veteran. And now he is a self-described ""Soldier of Christ"" back in Iraq, fighting ISIS on the front lines.

""People ask me, 'Why you?' I come back and I say, 'Why not? Why just me? Where's everyone else at?"" said Brett, who requested that ABC News not use his last name to protect his family back home.

""Jesus says, you know, 'What you do unto the least of them, you do unto me,'"" he added. ""I take that very seriously.""

Brett returned to Iraq six months ago. In 2006-07, he served in the infamous ""Triangle of Death,"" where he said he was badly wounded in an IED attack on his Humvee.

He came here, he told ABC News, to defend the defenseless -- to protect the Christians and others in this part of Iraq who have been terrorized by the ISIS onslaught: driven from their homes, massacred, their women and girls raped and sold into slavery.

He is of Irish and Polish descent, raised Roman Catholic and now describes himself simply as a Christian.

Brett fights alongside a small, local Christian militia -- the Dweikh Nawsha. They are under the command of Kurdish peshmerga forces in this part of Iraq.

From Brett's forward position, in the deserted Christian village of Bakufa, about eight miles from the outskirts of the city of Mosul in northern Iraq, you can see the black flags of ISIS whipping against the sky in a stiff winter wind.

In one from 2008, nuclear physicist Pedro Mascheroni, former scientist in the X-Division of the Los Alamos National Laboratory in the 1980s, tells the other man, who is really an undercover FBI agent, that Venezuela could test a nuclear bomb in the Pacific to put the U.S. on notice.

“Everybody sees it. You don’t kill anybody. Now you tell the United States, ‘Not only do we have this, but we have [these] other designs… You have to come up and say to the other nations, 'We are going to be, we’re going to have an umbrella for everybody. If any nation outside Latin America attacks any nation inside Latin America, we are going to retaliate with a nuclear bomb,'"" he says,

Mascheroni is a naturalized American citizen from Argentina.

In other audio recordings, referenced in court documents, Mascheroni speaks to his wife, another former worker at LANL, about his plans.

“This is very dangerous and I am doing it for money... I am, I told you, I’m not an American anymore. This is it,” Mascheroni says.

In 2013 Mascheroni pleaded guilty to several of the counts involving transmitting restricted information and making false statements to federal agents. He attempted to withdraw his guilty plea last summer, but the court denied the motion. Today the Justice Department announced Mascheroni has been sentenced to 60 months in prison, followed by three years of supervised release.

""[The] defendant’s aims were never noble, or part of some selfless journey that he had undertaken for the greater good of his fellow citizens,” the U.S. government wrote in a sentencing memorandum in January. “Rather, his actions were criminal to their core.""

In response to the government’s stinging sentencing memorandum, Mascheroni’s defense argued that he was something of a mad scientist “entrapped” by the government.

“Anyone who has spent time with Dr. Mascheroni knows that he is completely and hopelessly obsessed with correcting the errors he perceives in the National Laboratories’ pursuit of nuclear fusion energy. This obsession has controlled his life since he lost his security clearance in 1988. Providing Dr. Mascheroni with a willing, receptive, well-funded, and non-critical audience for his scientific theories was the functional equivalent of providing crack to a cocaine addict,” the defense said in a motion last week.

“We simply cannot allow people to violate their pledge to protect the classified nuclear weapons data with which they are entrusted,” Assistant Attorney General for National Security John Carlin said in a DOJ release. “Today’s sentencing should leave no doubt that counterespionage investigations remain one of our most powerful tools to protect national security.”

Mascheroni’s wife also pleaded guilty in 2013 to conspiracy and false statements. She was sentenced last August to just over a year in prison and three years supervised release. Neither the Venezuelan government, nor any Venezuelan officials, were accused of any wrongdoing in the case.

[Editor's Note: This report has been revised to clarify that Mascheroni's statement about ""doing it for the money"" was made to his wife and not to the undercover federal agent, as the original version of this report implied.]"

Allen Zderad, a 68-year-old retiree from Minnesota, saw his wife for the first time in more than a decade thanks to a bionic eye implanted by doctors at the Mayo Clinic earlier this month.

“Thank you,” Zderad said in the touching scene captured on video. “It’s crude but it’s significant. ... It’ll work.”

“Who do you see?” His wife Carmen asked Zderad just before the two hugged each other in a long, tearful embrace.

Zderad has retinitis pigmentosa, a degenerative condition that attacks the retina. There is no treatment or cure for the disease. He told ABC News his vision gradually deteriorated over a 20-year period until he was only able to sense very bright light.

After his grandson was diagnosed with the same condition last year, Zderad was recruited by the Mayo Clinic and Second Sight, the implant’s maker, to test out the device. Dr. Raymond Iezzi Jr., a Mayo Clinic researcher and ophthalmologist, performed the surgery.

The bionic eye implant sends light wave signals to the optic nerve, bypassing the damaged retina, a statement from the Mayo Clinic explained. In January, a tiny wafer-like chip was embedded in Zderad's right eye. Two weeks later, the eyeglass-style prosthetic device was activated.

Zderad described his new-found abilities as “artificial sight.” He is able to make out shapes, forms and outlines in intermittent flashes. Everything is in black and white now, but with training and periodic upgrades over a five-year period he is confident that he will begin to see more sharply, he told ABC News.

“What an exciting, emotional thing to say that, ‘Yes, that is my wife,’” Zderad said. “I am grateful they made this as much about the person as the technology.”"

According to a civil lawsuit, Culpepper told doctors of “low back pain and stiffness which is almost always present,” and said he had “quite a bit of difficulty... getting into or out of the bath and performing heavy activities around his home.”

Yet, on the Survivor episode, aired in 2013 and filmed on a remote island in the Philippines, Culpepper leads his team through a series of strenuous tasks: paddling a canoe, diving under water repeatedly, retrieving large crates and stacking them on the shore.

“I was on pain medication, and I had a back procedure right before that,” Culpepper told ABC News in his first public comments on the lawsuit.

“Just because I chose to do things that are contra [sic] to my body, doesn't mean I’m not in pain, and doesn't mean I’m not impaired,” Culpepper said in the interview to be broadcast tonight on ""World News Tonight with David Muir"" and ""Nightline"".

Now a prosperous personal injury lawyer in Tampa, Culpepper says he was hurt when front page headlines described his as a fraud and a fake.

“This whole lawsuit is ludicrous,” he told ABC News. “I've worked too hard in my life to have this as a headline.”

The insurance company alleges Culpepper “willfully and deceptively provided false information” to the doctors who examined him.

“I told the truth,"" Culpepper said, turning over a file of medical reports and x-rays that he says prove he suffered permanent injuries during his NFL career when he played for the Minnesota Vikings, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and the Chicago Bears.

At one point in the interview, as Culpepper grew frustrated at the questions of how he could perform so well on ""Survivor"" given his 89 percent disability rating, the 46-year-old former defensive lineman stripped down to his undershirt to show a torn bicep, and a serious shoulder injury.

“Is that normal?” he asked. “That’s not, okay, that causes me pain.”

Culpepper said he had no regrets about his appearance on ""Survivor,"" which triggered the fraud allegations.

“I did it for Monica,” he said, speaking of his wife who had previously appeared on ""Survivor"" and was invited back only if he would join her on the program.

But she says it was a mistake.

“I 100 percent wish I had never asked him to be on the show,” she told ABC News. “For all that he’s going through right now and being this insurance company’s target, is not worth it.”"

The dense space rock, which was actually only about 2 feet in diameter, flare brighter than the full moon, NASA Meteor Watch wrote on Facebook.

The American Meteor Society received 96 reports of sightings of the meteor from eyewitnesses.

A security camera in Robinson, Pennsylvania, caught the burning space rock lighting up the sky, and video from it was uploaded to YouTube by user Ron Shawley.

The event took place at around 4:50 a.m., NASA said.

""It lit up the sky (and all it the snow of course) bright blue,"" Pennsylvania resident Karen Rayner Bierbauer wrote on Facebook. ""Very neat.""

NASA Meteor Watch also released an animation showing the orbit of the fireball and the its perspective as it approached Earth. The celestial visitor came a ""might long way"" from an asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, the agency added.

Fragments known as meteorites could be scattered on the ground east of the Kittanin, Pennsylvania, where cameras lost track of the fireball, NASA Meteor Watch said."

The attacks happened in Houston and nearby Missouri City, Texas, and involved pedestrians walking alone, police said.

""It has no rhyme or reason, no particular time of day, no gender, no race, any of that,"" said detective Derek Spencer of the Missouri City Police Department. ""It just seems that random. ... That is very concerning and scary.""

Police said the attacks started at 7 p.m. on Tuesday, Feb. 17, when a gunman in a dark sport utility vehicle tried shooting at a 21-year-old college student. The gun jammed and the victim ran away.

About a half an hour later, 34-year-old Pak Ho was shot and killed nearby. He told police about a dark SUV before he died.

The third attack happened three hours later, police said.

Savalas Holmes said he saw a black Jeep Cherokee before he was shot near the thigh.

""He pulled right up on side of me. Window down already, already had it on his mind what he wanted to do,"" Holmes said. ""That's when I turned to run. That's when he shot me.""

Holmes said 1,000 thoughts ran through his head: ""Am I losing too much blood? Am I going to collapse here?”

Hours after Holmes was attacked, a 50-year-old man was shot at a bus stop 15 miles away.

Another attack happened at 7:30 a.m. Sunday, when police said a person was shot in the arm and stomach.

The suspect is believed to be in his early 30s, with a stocky build, light mustache and a beard.

""We want to try to bring this person to justice for those family members and the rest of the community where they don't have to live in fear,"" said detective Andy Robb of the Missouri City Police Department."

The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department arrested Erich Nowsch, 19, at a house only a block away from where the slain woman, Tammy Meyers, had lived with her family. Meyers' visibly upset husband, Robert Meyers, was standing nearby when the arrest was made after a two-hour standoff and was asked by police to back away from the area.

Police spokesman Christopher Tomaino said Nowsch was believed to be the only shooting suspect in the case but that police were still seeking another person involved.

Robert Meyers told reporters after the arrest that his family knew Nowsch and his late wife had had spent ""countless"" hours trying to help him.

""He knew where we lived,"" he said. ""We knew how bad he was.""

Tomaino said investigators were unaware that Meyers knew Nowsch.

Meyers said his wife and son went looking for Nowsch after the road rage incident because they knew him and where he lived.

Meyers said police have done an ""awesome"" job on the case.

Police revealed this week that Tammy Meyers and her armed son, Brandon, got in a car to look for the driver with whom she had a dispute last Thursday. She had been teaching her 15-year-old daughter how to drive in the parking lot of a nearby school.

After the incident on the road, Tammy Meyers drove home and asked her daughter to tell her 22-year-old son to come to the car. When the mother and son returned home, police said, the suspect's car pulled up. Gunfire erupted and Meyers was fatally wounded.

She died Saturday at the University Medical Center of Southern Nevada.

1Ju7ZhS,2015-02-20 00:00:00,ISIS Recruits: 3 Schoolgirls Flee Home to Join Terror Group - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/International/british-police-hunt-teens-headed-join-isis/story?id=29101510,"British Police have issued an urgent appeal looking for three schoolgirls after they were reported missing today, believed to be heading to Syria via Turkey to join Islamist fighters.

The three school friends from East London’s Bethnal Green, ages 15 to 16, left their homes before 8:00 a.m. local time Tuesday and met at Gatwick airport in London where they boarded a Turkish Airlines flight, according to a police news release.

""We are reaching out to the girls using the Turkish media and social media,” Britain’s Counter-Terrorism Commander Richard Walton said, “in the hope that they hear our messages, hear our concerns for their safety and have the courage to return now, back to their families who are so worried about them.""

Should the girls see news reports about themselves, Walton said he hopes they’ll listen to such a “direct appeal.”

“Clearly if these three girls travel to Syria, they’re in grave danger,” he said. “We are aware as many people of the treatment of girls and women currently in that part of Syria. You know the prospect is not good and we want to prevent them from getting there.”

Statements attributed to one major terror group in the region, ISIS, purportedly described the way its fighters treat women -– from buying and selling young girls as slaves to justifying rape of “non-believers.”

The U.S Senior Adviser for Foreign Fighters, Ambassador Thomas Krajeski, said during a news briefing today that young girls traveling to Syria and Iraq were being considered as problematic as those traveling to fight.

“Fighters include people not only picking up a gun, but also going to support Islamists, in some way, including young women who have been attracted to the fight for various reasons and in some cases children,” he said, adding the prospect of fighters returning to their home countries to conduct attacks is of “great concern.”

Krajeski also acknowledged the difficulty of controlling the Turkish-Syrian border. “This is a very difficult border to police,” he said. “The most effective way to do it is to provide border officials with the best possible information. I believe Turks are committed to increasing checks and controls of incoming travelers and border controls.”

At the Scotland Yard briefing, officials said the case of the three missing girls was related to one concerning another 15-year-old girl who was stopped by police in December while allegedly trying to get to Syria to join ISIS. Officials said the three missing girls were friends with the 15-year-old."

1JZFaoG,2015-02-02 00:00:00,Vanderbilt Rape Trial: Ex-Football Players Found Guilty - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/US/vanderbilt-rape-trial-football-players-found-guilty/story?id=28531342,"Two former Vanderbilt University football players on trial for sexually assaulting a female classmate in a campus dorm room were found guilty Tuesday.

A Nashville jury took just a few hours to decide Brandon Vandenburg and Cory Batey were guilty of four counts of aggravated rape, one count of attempted aggravated rape and two counts of aggravated sexual battery. Vandenburg was also found guilty of tampering with evidence and unlawful photography after prosecutors claimed he recorded the sexual assault on his phone and shared it with friends.

Vanderburg and Batey's bond has been revoked and they will be sentenced on March 6.

Two other ex-players accused of being involved in the incident, Brandon Banks and Jaborian McKenzie, also face charges of rape and sexual battery, but have not yet gone to trial. All four pleaded not guilty.

The graphic sexual assault case has played out in a Nashville courtroom over the past few weeks, reflecting many of the larger controversies colleges face today, including alcohol, sexual promiscuity and the role of popular culture.

Prosecutors presented a surveillance video showing Vandenburg carrying the victim to his dorm building that night, accompanied by Batey, Banks and McKenzie. According to prosecutors, the four former football players laughed at the victim, who was passed out, before they allegedly sexually assaulted her inside Vandenburg's room.

“Vandenburg, he had said, ‘we're going to have some,’” prosecutor Tom Thurman said. “He gives everyone a condom.”

Prosecutors also claimed Vandenburg took pictures and video of the assault and sent it to his friends, then later searched online for information about how to delete photos so the police couldn't find them. Prosecutors accused the former players of texting each other about the attack, trying to cover it up.

The defense argued the young men were not guilty of rape, but rather of making a mistake. Batey's lawyer, Worrick Robinson, claimed that college culture put his client in this situation. In court, the defense poked holes in how police conducted their investigation, also raising questions about the lack of DNA evidence found at the scene.

Batey, testifying in his own defense Monday, admitted he was the one in the cell phone video that prosecutors said showed him sexually assaulting the female classmate. He even attempted to apologize to the victim from the stand, saying “I’m just sorry. I never intended on hurting anyone.”

Batey also testified he was too drunk to remember the incident, claiming he blacked out after consuming between 14 and 22 drinks that night. He told the court he didn't realize what he had done until the next morning, after finding graphic photos on his phone as he was on his way to church.

“I was horrified,” he said. “I didn't know they got there. I didn't remember. I didn't know what had happened to the young lady in the pictures and I deleted them immediately.”"

She settles exhaustively on a tree stump to my immediate left and drops a hiking bag that dwarfs us both on the ground. I start feeling heavy as she stares in my direction, her worn-out eyes filled with a seeming wistful psychosis.

My instincts nudge me to drop to the ground the Oculus Rift headgear I’m wearing in a combined act of solidarity and escape. I turn to my right instead. Laura Dern as the ghost of Cheryl’s deceased mom, Bobbi, appears, says a few words to Cheryl, then disappears. Cheryl puts her monstrous hiking bag back on and walks away. I’m left alone, feeling unsettled. Cheryl may have just seen her dead mother talk to her, but in this film (if you can call it that), I was the ghost.

Fox Searchlight’s “Wild, the Experience” -- featured among 11 other mind-bending virtual reality projects at Sundance’s New Frontier installation -- was just one way tech and entertainment overlapped at this year’s festival. The looming presence of Amazon and Netflix, the heavily attended screenings and events hosted by start-ups like Airbnb, and even the techie swag gifted to celebrities -- from wireless home security cameras at Kari Feinstein’s Style Lounge to Columbia’s new heat-tech outerwear -- collectively gave the festival a tech-tipping-point feel.

While the presence of tech at the festival isn’t new, the embrace of it by Hollywood is. Just five years go, for instance, when then-celebrated startup Gowalla partnered with the festival in a big way, I remember a woman behind me whispering at a screening, in earnest, “what’s Gowalla? Is that a fruit drink?” Laptops were usually an “outsider” badge; this year, I even spotted The Real Housewives reality star Gretchen Rossi hunched over a laptop writing for a blog, RumorFix, at celeb hangout TR Suites. In 2010, New Frontier’s projects weren’t featured front-and-center on Main Street, the festival’s convergence point, as they were this year, either; they were settled in a remote nosebleed area of the festival. Tech was the festival’s bastard child.

""[Virtual reality] experiments were showing up at New Frontier a few years ago,” said David Greenbaum, senior vice president of production at Fox Searchlight, “but they were incredibly fringe. They certainly weren't considered the go-to event. I believe the New Frontier section is going to be one of the most exciting places at Sundance this year.""

He was right. At the festival’s most coveted events, from Nicole Kidman’s private premiere party to HBO’s documentary film dinner, I consistently heard senior film industry professionals and celebrities discuss Birdly -- another virtual reality installation at New Frontier -- as often and with the same level of enthusiasm as when referencing any film that premiered.

Birdly, created by Max Rheiner, simulates the experience of flying over the city of San Francisco using a full-body virtual reality device that allows one to experience the movements of a bird. Experiencing Birdly, I felt a stomach-drop feeling bred of being handed not only a literal birds-eye view, but a metaphorical one into what’s ahead as the two unlikely worlds of Silicon Valley and Hollywood merge."
1K8EtLD,2015-02-03 00:00:00,Devastated City Left in Ruins After ISIS Defeated - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/International/syrian-city-ruins-isis-defeated/story?id=28690892,"Block after block of homes, shops and restaurants lie in ruins in the northern Syrian city of Kobane, now quiet after four months of relentless fighting between ISIS militants and Kurdish forces on the ground, and the U.S.-led coalition jets dropping bombs from above.

It’s hard to find a structure in this once peaceful city on the border with Turkey that hasn't been touched. Next to flattened apartment buildings stand shops with their storefronts shattered, outside there are deep craters in the middle of the streets.

Unexploded shells lie buried where they landed and the stench of decomposing bodies wafts through the air from the corpses of ISIS fighters that have yet to be collected.

Virtually all of this Kurdish city’s residents fled to Turkey to escape the fighting, over 200,000 filling refugee camps along the border. Few have returned. With around 70 percent of the city destroyed, there’s almost nothing to come back to.

But despite the post-apocalyptic landscape, the few still in the city are relishing the ISIS defeat.

""I feel victory,"" local journalist Mustafa Mohammed Ali, who stayed in Kobane during the four months of fighting, told ABC News as he walked amid the destruction. ""Kobane sent a message for all over the world: If you resist you can win.""

Since late September, the U.S.-led coalition carried out more than 700 air strikes on ISIS targets in and around the city, more than any other place in Syria and Iraq. With fighting visible from the Turkish side of the border, U.S. officials admitted the battle was less about the strategic fight than the symbolism of defeating ISIS, whose forces and weapons surrounded the town.

“We said a long time ago Kobane was not strategically important to us,” the head of Centcom, Gen. Lloyd Austin, told the Wall Street Journal. “But it is awfully important to him [ISIS]… In that alone, we have taken out over 2,000 of his troops, which is a phenomenal sacrifice.”

In October, ISIS released a video claiming they had almost completely overrun Kobane. Kidnapped British journalist John Cantlie appeared in the town, claiming ISIS fighters were simply “mopping up now.”

But on Saturday, ISIS-linked media released another video admitting defeat “because of the bombardment and the killing of some brothers.”

""The warplanes did not leave any construction. They destroyed everything, so we had to withdraw and the rats advanced,” a fighter said, according to The Associated Press, adding that ISIS “will stay.”

Indeed, fighting can still be heard a few miles from the center of Kobane in the villages surrounding the city where Kurdish fighters are still battling ISIS.

But in the city, journalist Ali said, the focus is on rebuilding and returning to normal life, adding that he hopes foreign financial assistance will follow the ISIS defeat.

""We beg the international community to send aid for Kobane to help in rebuilding,"" he said."

The public outrage comes after the terror group shared a video that purports to show the pilot, Lt. Muath al-Kasasbeh, in an orange jumpsuit in an outdoor cell before being set on fire.

The brutality of the execution has prompted calls for retribution by the protesters, and ABC News' Nasser Atta is on the ground in Amman.

Here is a description of how the scene unfolded as word spread about the violent video:

the father of the Jordanian pilot went to meet with the Jordanian army chief of staff, and to the home town in south #Jordan.

Jordanian King Abdullah is currently in Washington and had a meeting with Secretary of State John Kerry moments before the video was released. About two hours after the news broke, a taped statement by King Abdullah was aired on Jordanian television, where he condemned the killing of the pilot, denounced his killing as being contrary to the teachings of Islam.

""We stand by the family of the hero martyr and with our people and our armed forces, in this tragedy that has touched all Jordanians,"" the king said in the statement that was recorded in the U.S. this afternoon.

""It is the duty of all Jordanians to stand side by side, show the metal of the Jordanian people in facing the challenges that will only make us stronger and more united,"" he said."

Among the dead were at least six passengers on the train and the driver of the black Jeep Cherokee that was struck and dragged at about 10 car lengths, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and other officials said late this evening.

The Metropolitan Transportation Authority said the gates came down on top of the SUV at the crossing, which was stopped on the tracks. The driver got out to look at the rear of the car, then she got back in and drove forward and was struck.

A driver who said he saw the train hit the car described the incident in the same way.

""The gate came down and hit the back of the car in front of me, it was an SUV and it caught the roof, it bounced off the roof, and then slid a little bit behind the back window,"" Rick Hope said.

Passengers were evacuated to the back of the Harlem Line train and then were taken to a local rock-climbing gym for shelter, the Cliffs. Buses were dispatched to move the hundreds of passengers to Pleasantville, a spokesperson for the railroad said.

At least 12 passengers were injured and taken to area hospitals. The train had left New York's Grand Central Station at 5:44 p.m. and the collision occurred at 6:30 p.m. ET.

Aerial video of the scene showed the head car of the train in flames and at least one vehicle crushed beneath it. The vehicle was struck at the Commerce St. grade crossing in Hawthorne.

Harlem Line Service was temporarily suspended between North White Plains and Pleasantville, the railroad tweeted.

More than 750 passengers were estimated to be on board, including Justin Kaback, commuting home to Danbury, Connecticut.

""I was trapped. You know there was people in front of me and behind me and I was trapped in the middle of a car and it was getting very hot,"" he told ABC News. ""All the air was turned off so there was no circulation so it was definitely scary especially when people are walking by on the outside and they said, the train's on fire, there's a fire.""

Mark Doose said he fell about 114 feet into a ravine while trying to follow ski lift supports down a mountain.

In an interview with Eurovision, Doose said he made some quick decisions once he knew he was lost.

Over the next two days, Doose built a snow cave, waded through an ice cold river three times, and climbed out of the ravine.

Doose yelled for five hours for help and - two days after he lost his way - he was found by a passer-by.

""When they first answered me that was just incredible,"" Doose said. ""To have someone responding after not talking to anyone and having anyone hearing me for almost two and a half days - so that was definitely pretty emotional.""

The former rap mogul, whose bail was set at $2,025,000, was arrested over a fatal crash in Compton, Calif., authorities said.

Knight met with homicide detectives after authorities identified him as a person of interest in a hit-and-run case.

The District Attorney may get the case on Monday, Blatt added.

Blatt told ABC News that Knight did not realize he had hit anyone. He added that authorities are looking for witnesses and video of the incident.

“I hope they find both so Mr. Knight can be exonerated,"" he said.

According to a Los Angeles Sheriff's Department, witnesses identified the driver as Knight, and the vehicle involved in the incident was described as a red Ford F-150 Raptor, similar to Knight's vehicle.

In August, Knight was injured in a shooting at a pre-MTV Video Music Awards party in Los Angeles.

Knight, who founded Death Row Records, was also shot at a pre-VMAs party hosted by Kanye West in 2005, and he was behind the wheel of the car in which rapper Tupac Shakur was fatally shot in 1996.

Death Row Records dominated the West Coast hip-hop scene of the early to mid-1990s, releasing albums such as Dr. Dre's ""The Chronic"" and helping to develop performers including Snoop Dogg.

Leland Melvin, who retired from NASA last February according to the space agency, is seen in the photo in the traditional orange spacesuit worn by astronauts in their official photos, but instead of posing alone, Melvin is flanked by his two dogs.

The undated photo of Melvin, 50, was tweeted Wednesday by Adam Aton, a newspaper reporter in Missouri.

This is an official portrait for astronaut Leland Melvin. Also, his handle is @Astro_Flow. I'm in awe. pic.twitter.com/KHWVo94mZO

When another tweeter asked Melvin if the story that he snuck the two dogs into the NASA studio during his photo shoot is true, Melvin replied, “Yes sir!,” followed by a rocket emoji.

“@chrisfloyduk: @AdamAton @marthaburzynsk AF told me he snuck his dogs into the NASA studio 4 that shot. Is that right, Leland?” Yes sir! ??

Melvin has evidently won praise for his photo before because another person tweeted to him on Jan. 24 that he has “the best astronaut photo.”

Melvin replied to that tweet with another photo, this one showing his two dogs sitting stoically by his side.

“@isorude_mark: @Astro_Flow You have the best astronaut photo!”Thx Mark. The time when they were behaving during ?? ?? pic.twitter.com/hvlZjAIVkN

Neither Melvin nor NASA responded today to ABC News’ requests for comment.

According to Melvin’s NASA biography, the Virginia native was selected by NASA in 1998 and is a veteran of two space flights, logging over 565 hours in space.

Melvin later went on to travel the country as co-manager of NASA’s Educator Astronaut Program and was named as associate administrator for the Office of Education."

The HPV vaccine has been on the market since 2006, but is not as widely used as other recommended vaccines, according to the federal Centers of Disease Control and Prevention.

The vaccine, given in three doses, is recommended for both boys and girls between the ages of 11 and 12. Just one dose of the vaccine cut down the risk of contracting HPV by 82 percent, according to a 2010 CDC study.

Dr. Anupam Jena, lead author of the study and a physician at Massachusetts General Hospital, said one likely cause for the low use of vaccine is that many parents and physicians are apprehensive about the possibility that the vaccine could lead to an increase in unsafe sex among teens and young adults.

“I’d like to emphasize that it’s a real concern. It’s not something to automatically dismiss but that’s why we need some scientific evidence to show we’re on the right path,” said Jena, an assistant professor of Health Care Policy and Medicine at the Harvard Medical School.

In the study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, Jena and his colleagues combed an insurance database to figure out whether people who had the vaccine had higher rates of sexually transmitted infections than those who did not get the vaccine.

The researchers looked at the medical history between 2005 and 2010 of 21,000 girls between the ages of 12 to 18, who had been given the vaccine, and compared them with 180,000 women who did not have the vaccine. The study found that the vaccinated women did not have higher rates of sexually transmitted infections, suggested they did not have increased rates of unsafe sex.

Jena said U.S. HPV vaccination rates pale in comparison to similar countries such as Australia, where around 80 to 90 percent of eligible young people are vaccinated. He said he hoped the research would encourage parents and physicians to get their children vaccinated.

""This is a reasonable concern to have had, but the evidence suggests that it’s not important,"" Jena said. ""[Physicians] can be reassured by these findings and use them to talk to their patients.""

Robert Bednarczyk, assistant professor in the Hubert Department of Global health at Rollins School of Public Health at Emory University in Atlanta, wrote a commentary on the study for the Journal of the American Medical Association and said physicians have not recommended the vaccine as much as other recommended vaccines given to teens such as shots for meningitis.

Because HPV is a sexually transmitted virus, Bednarczyk said some doctors are uncomfortable talking about potential sexual activity with their patients and their parents.

“Some of them even said, ‘I think 11 is too young to have this discussion with patient,” Bednarczyk said.

But Bednarczyk points out the vaccine is supposed to be given well before an adolescent is exposed to the virus through possible sexual activity and that the way the virus is transmitted does not need to be discussed in detail.

""Do you go into a detailed discussion about why it can spread and how it can spread?"" said Bednarczyk, who pointed out doctors don't often go into great detail about how bacterial meningitis is spread before they suggest their patients get vaccinated. ""This is a vaccine that’s recommended for you and it’s going to keep you from getting sick.""

Bednarczyk also pointed out another reason the shot is recommended at a young age is because younger patients tend to have a stronger immune response than older teens."

“Speedriding is a perfect blend of big mountain skiing and high-performance parachute flying and what it does is allow people like myself to go to terrain and do lines that were never thought ride-able before because they closed out in big crevasses or big cliffs,” DeVore said.

Watch the full story on ""Nightline"" tonight at 12:35 a.m. ET

An Alaska native, DeVore was practically born on skis, taking to the slopes at a young age. By 17, he was restless for something more. He became obsessed first with big mountain skiing and then human flight.

Eventually, he found speedriding, which allowed him to push the limits on both. DeVore is now sponsored by Red Bull and is the manager of the Red Bull Air Force, a team of professional pilots, BASE jumpers, skydivers and para-gliders. DeVore is also featured in a new RedBull documentary, ""The Unrideables: Alaska Range,"" available now on RedBullTV.

“Some people might go to a shrink and talk to a doctor, other people might do something else to find a way to shut their mind off but for me you know when I get out to the air that’s when – that’s my meditation. That’s why I call this my air therapy,” DeVore said.

“I think it’s very special and very lucky to be able to turn my passion into my profession. I feel like I got a shooting star.”

DeVore, along with his flying partner and Red Bull teammate Andy Farrington, and veteran guides Clark Fyans and Mike Olsen, took “Nightline” up to a narrow ridge called High Ivory in Utah, 10,000 feet above sea level, to experience speedriding with the pros.

They have to check for “countless” variables on the slopes, such as rocks, trees, wind speed – DeVore also has an avalanche air bag and a lightweight canopy, or parachute, he called his “Ferrari” as part of his gear.

“The scariest part of speedriding is that if you land heavy on your skis and you unload pressure, and you don’t have taut lines, the canopy doesn’t know what to do,” DeVore said.

But while on his jump, DeVore ran into trouble, and tore his ACL. In 21 years as a professional extreme athlete, who even worked as a stuntman in “Iron Man,” “Iron Man 3” and “Transformers 3,” it was his first injury in a line of work that has killed many.

So DeVore sent “Nightline” back up with Farrington to try the High Ivory run again.

Photos from South Korea's official news agency show Mark Lippert with blood on his hand and holding his bleeding face. A man shouted ""No to war training!"" before attacking him, the Yonhap news agency reported.

The ambassador was slashed on the face and wrist by the man who was screaming that the rival Koreas should be unified, South Korean police said Thursday, according to the Associated Press. Lippert was attacked with a 10-inch fruit knife, police told ABC News. His assailant was arrested, according to Robert Ogburn, an official at the U.S. embassy in Seoul, who said the U.S. strongly condemned the ""senseless act of violence.""

In a televised briefing, Chung Nam-sik of the Severance Hospital said 80 stitches were needed to close the facial wound, which was more than 4 inches long and 1 inch deep. He added the cut did not affect his nerves or salivary gland.

President Obama called Lippert to tell him that ""he and his wife Robyn are in his thoughts and prayers, and to wish him the very best for a speedy recovery,” according to National Security Council spokesperson Bernadette Meehan.

Lippert previously held positions at the Department of Defense from May 2012 until September 2014, according to the embassy website.

Sheriff's deputies arrested the boy's mother, Elizabeth Hupp, 25; his grandmother, Rose Brewer, 58; his aunt, Denise Kroutil, 38; and, Nathan Wynn Firoved, 23, on Wednesday.

Kroutil had asked Firoved, a co-worker, to kidnap her 6-year-old nephew to ""scare"" him because he was ""too nice"" to people, according to the Lincoln County Sheriff's Office.

Firoved allegedly lured the boy into his truck on Monday, police said. While inside the truck, Firoved told the boy he would never ""see his mommy again"" and that he would be ""nailed to the wall of a shed.""

After the boy started to cry, police said Firoved showed him a handgun and said he would be hurt if he did not stop crying.

Firoved bound the boy's hands and feet with plastic bags and covered his face as they drove, police said. They eventually stopped at the boy's home, where he was taken into the basement.

According to a statement released by the Lincoln County Sheriff's Office, Kroutil took off the boy's pants and told him that he could be sold into ""sex slavery."" She allegedly was upset that he did not try resisting her.

The boy was eventually unbound and led upstairs, where his family lectured him about ""stranger danger,"" according to police. Investigators believe the incident lasted about four hours.

Family members told police their intent was to educate the boy and felt they did nothing wrong, according to the sheriff's statement.

The boy later told school officials about the incident, who contacted the Division of Family Services, police said. He was placed into protective custody.

Firoved, Brewer and Kroutil have been charged with felony kidnapping, felonious restraint, and felony abuse and neglect of a child, police said. Hupp is charged with felony kidnapping and felony abuse and neglect of a child.

They all remain in police custody under a $250,000 cash bond each. They are scheduled to have arraignment hearings this morning."

A surveillance camera in the hospital lobby caught the dog entering through the automatic doors and wandering around.

The dog, named Sissy, belongs to Nancy Franck, 64, who has been at Mercy Medical Center for about two weeks following surgery. Her husband, Dale Franck, 66, had been taking care of Sissy and her brother Barney, also a miniature Schnauzer, back home.

“She was on a mission that night to see her mom,"" Dale Franck told ABC News today, ""but she couldn't find the right elevator to take.""

He said he noticed Sissy was missing around 1:30 a.m. this past Saturday, and he was worried sick.

""I kept checking everywhere, calling out, 'Sissy! Sissy!'"" he recalled. ""I was pulling my hair out.""

He finally got a call at 5:30 a.m. from security officer Samantha Conrad at the hospital, saying she had found his dog, he said.

""She found my number and house address from her tag on her collar,"" Dale Franck said. ""I was so relieved, and I asked my daughter go and pick her up.""

The security officer and the hospital did not immediately respond to ABC News' calls for comment.

Dale Franck's daughter got permission to take Sissy up to Nancy Franck for a few minutes, he said.

""She told her mom, 'I got a surprise for you!'"" Dale Franck said. ""My wife was like, 'How'd you get her in here? Did you sneak her under your coat?""

His daughter said that the ""little spoiled brat"" ran away from home because she wanted to see her mom, Dale Franck said, though it's unclear how the dog actually got there.

""Nancy and Sissy were able to love each other for a few minutes, and then she went back with me,"" Dale Franck said. ""She's my baby, and though it sounds funny now, it wasn't funny when she was missing. I was worried sick. I'm glad she's OK.""

He has one theory about how Sissy might have gotten 20 blocks to his wife.

""The only thing I could think of was that Sissy used to ride with me to pick up my wife from work next door to the hospital,"" Dale Franck said. ""But we've never walked that route before.""

Nancy Franck has been battling uterine cancer, and though doctors believe most of the cancer is gone, she is undergoing chemotherapy to make sure, Dale Franck said.

""She has a close relationship with Sissy,"" he added. ""Sissy's 11 now, and we bought her when she was just about 8 weeks old. She came up to me, scratched my leg and fell asleep on my shoulder. I'd say we didn't pick her, she picked us."""

Craig Stephen Hicks, 46, was charged with three counts of first-degree murder and ordered held without bail Wednesday morning.

His wife, Karen Hicks, said she was shocked at the news of the event and that she believed the incident was not religiously motivated.

“We were married for seven years and that is one thing that I do know about him,"" Karen Hicks told reporters today. ""He often champions on his Facebook page for the rights of many individuals -- for same-sex marriages, abortion, race. He just believed -- I know that’s just one of the things I know about him is that everyone is just equal.”

Hicks' attorney Rob Maitland said his client had a ""longstanding issue"" with parking, saying, ""it has nothing to do with the religious faith"" of the victims.

“Unfortunately these victims were there at the wrong time at the wrong place,"" Maitland said.

""Our preliminary investigation indicates that the crime was motivated by an ongoing neighbor dispute over parking,"" Chapel Hill Police said in a statement. ""Hicks is cooperating with investigators and more information may be released at a later time.""

Police earlier said they were investigating whether the shooting was a hate crime. All three victims were Muslim.

Duke University’s Imam Abdullah Antepli said, “This may or may not be a hate crime,” adding that authorities have been “extremely helpful and supportive.”

U.S. Attorney in North Carolina Ripley Rand said, ""We don't have any information that this was a targeted campaign against Muslims in North Carolina.”

Two of the victims -- Deah Barakat, 23, a second-year student in UNC's School of Dentistry, and Yusor Mohammad, 21, a prospective dental student -- were married. Mohammad's sister, Razan Mohammad Abu-Salha, was a sophomore at North Carolina State University in Raleigh and was visiting her sister and brother-in-law, according to Deah Barakat's father.

Gunshots were reported after 5 p.m. Tuesday in the Finley Forest condominiums in Chapel Hill, east of the University of North Carolina campus.

Farris Barakat, Deah Barakat's brother, said Hicks had confronted his brother previously about a dispute over a parking space, adding that he never heard Hicks make any anti-Muslim remarks.

When Farris Barakat had visited his brother, Hicks had yelled at him, telling him he was parking in the wrong space, Farris Barakat told ABC News. Farris Barakat added that he tried to respond in a calm manner, not wanting to upset Hicks further, and said his brother also treated Hicks in a respectful manner.

Hicks showed up at Barakat and Mohammad's home in the past with a gun on his belt, and Mohammad had confided that she was afraid of Hicks, Farris Barakat said. The two joked that maybe she should get a gun, he added.

The nation's largest Muslim civil rights organization, The Council on American-Islamic Relations, requested law enforcement authorities address speculation about a possible bias motive in the homicide.

Information about the shooting was heavily shared on social media, fueling hashtags such as #MuslimLivesMatter and #ChapelHillShooting to trend across the United States."

Many of the victims were commuters, with the ensuing fire magnified by an electrified third rail of the track buckling and piercing the train car where Gross, who was uninjured, was sitting.

A man sitting nearby screamed, Gross told ABC News of the Westchester County collision. The lower section of the man's leg was gone. Multiple passengers in Gross' train car died in the accident and aftermath, authorities said. Many others were seriously injured.

Winning tickets were sold in North Carolina, Texas and Puerto Rico, matching the numbers 25, 11, 54, 13 and 39, with a Powerball of 19. At this point, none of the winners has emerged.

Another winning ticket was sold at Scotchman, a convenience store in Shallotte, North Carolina.

“We got a call from the lottery, and it’s exciting to be able to experience a customer of ours who has this life-changing experience,” said Rich Mione, the director of marketing at GPM Investments, which owns the store.

The third winning ticket was sold at a Shell gas station in Cotto Laurel in southern Puerto Rico, the U.S. territory’s first Powerball win after joining the lottery in October.

Should the winners select the lump-sum option, each would get one-third of $381,138,450.16 before taxes. The other option is an annuity, under which the lottery would make payments 30 times over 29 years. Additionally, stores that sell jackpot-winning tickets are slated to receive a cash payout.

Beyond the jackpot winners, 33 other tickets across 17 states matched five numbers, but missed the Powerball, for $1 million. New Hampshire resident Bob Wolak just missed matching the Powerball, but he says he’s content with his winnings.

“Of course you kick yourself – 18 [for the Powerball] and the winner was 19. But I’m happy with a million dollars,” Wolak said."

Amy Pascal is stepping down as Sony Pictures Entertainment's co-chair to launch a new production venture at the studio in May.

“I have spent almost my entire professional life at Sony Pictures and I am energized to be starting this new chapter based at the company I call home,” Pascal, who joined Columbia Pictures in 1988, said in a statement.

In December, Pascal apologized for the content of hacked private emails to mega-producer Scott Rudin, in which stars like Angelina Jolie and Adam Sandler were criticized.

Pascal's new company will focus on movies, theater and television, though further details weren't announced.

But she won't be moving very far. Her new gig will be based at the Sony Pictures lot in Culver City, California. Sony Pictures will finance her venture in a four-year agreement and retain distribution rights to the films.

“I have always wanted to be a producer,"" she said in a statement today. ""[Sony Entertainment CEO Michael Lynton] and I have been talking about this transition for quite some time and I am grateful to him for giving me the opportunity to pursue my long-held dream and for providing unparalleled support. As the slate for the next two years has come together, it felt like the right time to transition into this new role. I am so grateful to my team, some of whom I have worked with for the last 20 years and others who have joined more recently. I am leaving the studio in great hands. I am so proud of what we have all done together and I look forward to a whole lot more.”

Sony reeled from a major corporate hacking incident associated with its comedic film starring Seth Rogen and James Franco, ""The Interview."" On Wednesday, the company said the hack cost $15 million.

""It is a devastating tragedy and I cannot pretend to imagine what this family is going through at this time. I am praying for them. I will continue to cooperate in every way possible.""

Jenner, 65, was being followed by paparazzi, but did not appear to be attempting to evade them before he was involved in the chain-reaction crash that took place Saturday afternoon in Malibu, California, police said.

The driver of the Lexus was killed, while five people inside the Humvee suffered non-life threatening injuries, police said. Jenner was uninjured, said his rep.

""He did not appear intoxicated or under the influence of anything at the time,"" said Los Angeles County Sheriff's Office Sgt. Philip Brooks.

Police investigating the fatal crash said they will likely ask for texting and cell phone records from Jenner, an Olympic gold medalist and reality star on ""Keeping Up with the Kardashians,"" and from the other drivers involved in the crash.

Jenner's publicist says the Olympic gold medalist was not texting, and that Jenner will provide his cellphone records if requested.

Los Angeles County Sheriff's Office Sgt. Philip Brooks said that if investigators decide they want to see the cell phone activity, the information would be sought from all the drivers involved in the crash, and said Jenner was not considered a suspect in the crash.

""No, he's just a party to the crash,"" Brooks said.

""The problem is pinpointing the time of the accident,"" Brooks said, regarding whether phone records would be any help in determining the cause of the crash. ""If the accident occurred at 12:05 and 30 seconds, or 12:05 and 40 seconds, if you hung up before that, that's useless information."""
1L7nS9F,2015-02-17 00:00:00,How Two Young Sisters Cope With a Rare Muscle Wasting Disease - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Health/young-sisters-cope-rare-muscle-wasting-disease/story?id=29001370,"Around the time of Brielle Kennedy's first birthday, her parents, Sarah and Eric, noticed that her physical development was a little slow.

""Our pediatrician told us not to worry at first but when she still wasn't walking at 16 months, he sent us to a specialist,” Sarah Kennedy recalled.

The toddler was diagnosed with type II spinal muscular atrophy, a rare condition that is part of a group of childhood diseases that cause the muscles of young children to waste away. SMA, as the disease is called in shorthand, occurs when there is a missing ""survival neuron gene"" and the body cannot produce the necessary proteins to build up muscle.

Their daughter would never walk, doctors told the Kennedys. She would have trouble holding up her head and neck and would likely need extensive medical treatment, including physical therapy and occupational therapy for the rest of her life, doctors told the couple.

The diagnosis came soon after Kennedy gave birth to her second daughter, Brooke, and just five days before her husband, a physician’s assistant with the Army, was about to be deployed to Afghanistan for a year. Shortly after he left, Brooke was also diagnosed with SMA.

“It was a really rough time,” Kennedy said. “But we tried to remain hopeful and learn everything we could about the disease.”

SMA affects one in every 6,000 to 10,000 children, the Kennedys soon found out. There is no known cure or treatment.

Doctors explained that when both parents are carriers for SMA there is a 25 percent chance their child will have the disease.

The Kennedys did have some good luck. Eric Kennedy met another soldier who knew a physician at one the top SMA programs in the country at Boston Children’s Hospital. They were invited to fly from their home in Michigan with their older daughter to attend a clinic.

“I spent two days soaking up every bit of information I could while Brielle was seen by every doctor imaginable related to the disease,” Kennedy said, adding that the experience helped lift the family’s spirits immensely.

The younger daughter also caught a break. She was entered into clinical trial for a medication given to infants diagnosed with SMA but who don’t yet show symptoms. While it hasn’t stopped the progression of the disease, the Kennedys say it has slowed it significantly.

The Kennedys said they are hopeful about several other new trials in the works, including one that is a possible SMA cure. As they hope and pray for a medical breakthrough, the Kennedys said that Brooke and Brielle lead full, happy lives with lots of friends and a love of Disney princesses and animals.

Last year, the family worked with their congressman, Rep. Fred Upton, and the National Organization of Rare Diseases to help pass a new law that funds medical research for rare and devastating childhood diseases. They say that focusing on the positive and finding support is key.

“To other parents in a similar situation I would say take one day at a time,” Kennedy said. “Learn as much as you can and connect with other families who are dealing with the same disease so that you can really learn more about what is to come.”

Mattel unveiled ""Hello Barbie"" today, an Internet-connected version of the popular doll that is able to carry on a conversation with her owner using Wi-Fi and a partnering app.

Mattel's Barbie, perhaps the most iconic doll of the past five and a half decades, has come in life-size form. She's also starred in animated movies and even her own workout video, but Hello Barbie is the closest she has ever come to talking with her owner.

The high-tech makeover of the doll was done in collaboration with ToyTalk, a San Francisco-based entertainment company.

After connecting to a Wi-Fi network, ""Barbie is online and talks directly to the ToyTalk servers,"" Martin Reddy, co-founder and chief technical officer at ToyTalk, told ABC News.

""Our artificial intelligence engine is running with the content of what Barbie can say. That AI engine's job is to decide what is best to say back,"" Reddy said. ""All of the logic, behavior, content is on the servers.""

The thought that security-conscious parents might not want an Internet-connected toy with a microphone in their home ""is a very legitimate concern and one we are very concerned about as well,"" Reddy said.

""We already have several apps in market that do this. We stream audio off the device that is personal information,"" he said. ""We have made sure we have built a solution that is COPPA [Children's Online Privacy Protection Act] compliant and approved by Kid Safe, an independent organization.""

""Anything we capture is stored securely and we provide full access to the parents to that information as well,"" Reddy said. ""They can review what is there, delete anything they don't like.""

The $74.99 doll will be available this fall and includes the ability to play interactive games with Barbie and let her tell jokes and stories, according to Mattel."

The masked man speaks briefly in the video, which purports to show the gruesome execution of 21 Coptic Christians in Libya, declaring that ISIS’s Libyan affiliate is “on the south of Rome,” an apparent reference to ISIS’s expansion into Libya and the threat it poses to the West.

As in the hunt for the ISIS fighter dubbed “Jihadi John,” U.S. officials are conducting detailed analysis of the clues on the video. In the “Jihadi John” videos, believed to have been shot in Syria, authorities say they have been able to identify that masked figure with a British accent who appeared to murder Western journalists and aid workers. He is believed to be a British citizen, officials say, though he has not been publicly named.

The potential role of an American ISIS recruit – which would not be a first for the terror group -- comes as the White House today began a three-day effort with community leaders to stem the flow of the terror pipeline from the U.S. to the Middle East.

One front on which ISIS has been successful in recruitment, analysts and U.S. officials have said, is on social media. J.M. Berger, terrorism expert and author of a forthcoming book on ISIS, estimates that the group has 30,000 to 40,000 supporters active online every day.

The U.S. State Department has attempted to counter ISIS propaganda by engaging would-be jihadis one-on-one online, sometimes by calling adult ISIS fighters cowards who use women recruits only for sex. Some analysts say the U.S. campaign of insults misses the mark.

“It’s not impacting the people who may be inspired by the ISIS ideology and will carry out attacks on its behalf,” said John Cohen, former Counterterrorism Coordinator at the Department of Homeland Security and current ABC News consultant."

As of 6 p.m. Sunday, parts of Iowa had received up to 14 inches of snow. Across Chicago, more than 8 inches of snow had fallen at O'Hare International Airport and just to the west at Midway Airport, more than 9 inches of snow had fallen.

A blizzard warning remained in effect for the Chicago Metro Area until midnight local time for gusty winds blowing snow around and creating white-out conditions.

On Sunday afternoon, snow was falling simultaneously all the way from eastern Nebraska to central Pennsylvania, a distance of more than 1,100 miles, making the storm the most far-reaching of the season.

By Sunday evening, snow was still falling from Chicago to Detroit and light snow had begun to fall across eastern Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York. A wintry mix and areas of heavy rain extended further south from Indianapolis to the mid-Atlantic.

By the Monday morning commute, heavy snow is expected to be falling across much of the Northeast, with a dangerous icy mix further to the south that could affect cities from central Pennsylvania to northern New Jersey and New York City.

Temperatures will be milder to the south, so Philadelphia to Baltimore and Washington D.C. will see mostly rain.

Current forecasts from the ABC News Weather Team call for additional snowfall of 6-10 inches from Chicago to southern New England.

The highest amounts are expected from the eastern Great Lakes, including Detroit, eastward into central New England where a widespread 10-14 inches of snow will fall.

New York City can expect 2 to 5 inches of snow, Mayor Bill de Blasio said today, but added that ""a lot can change between now and the early morning hours.""

A winter storm watch will begin in the city at 7 p.m., he said.

The mayor said the biggest threats are ice and wind gusts.

""Keep your time outside limited tomorrow night,"" de Blasio said. ""Don't go outside if you don't need to.""

In addition to the heavy snow threat, dangerous icy conditions could cause travel problems from central Pennsylvania to Connecticut Monday morning. Major interstates, including routes 80 and 95, will likely be impacted first from heavy snow after midnight then an icy mix of sleet and freezing rain.

The storm was expected to begin to move out of the Northeast later on Monday morning, although some snow will likely still be falling across parts of New England into the evening."

The goal is to make sure the space telescope, which is set to launch in 2018 and be the eventual successor to the immensely successful Hubble Space Telescope, will be fully operational when it reaches its freezing destination 1 million miles from Earth.

NASA researchers will be watching especially close to see how the telescope performs in the newly renovated space simulating Chamber A at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. The vacuum chamber is the same place where the Apollo spacecraft were tested.

Moving even a test part of what NASA said is the largest and most powerful space telescope ever built is no small feat. With the 3,000-pound Pathfinder Backplane in a clean room at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, the team glided in a shipping container on air pads, a move NASA likened to a puck on an air hockey table.

Using a crane, engineers were then able to lift the part and safely lower it into the Space Telescope Transporter for Air Road and Sea (STTARS), which was then hooked up to a semi truck that plodded along at a gentle 5 mph to the nearby Joint Base Andrews.

The largest cargo plane in the United States fleet, a C-5 military plane, then had the honor of flying to the engineers in Texas what will surely be a vital piece of space history.

“We've got to test the test,” Andrew Booth, a NASA engineer, said in a statement. ""That's why this Pathfinder is so valuable because it will ensure the testing on the actual telescope is accurate.""

The telescope is named for James Webb, a former NASA administrator, and is a collaboration with the European Space Agency and the Canadian Space Agency."

1LcwzPU,2015-02-19 00:00:00,Former Federal Judge Regrets 55-Year Marijuana Sentence - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/US/federal-judge-regrets-55-year-marijuana-sentence/story?id=28869467,"Weldon Angelos was just 24 years old when he was sentenced to 55 years in federal prison for three marijuana sales. He is one of the hundreds of thousands of federal prisoners serving decades-long sentences for non-violent crimes, thanks to mandatory minimum sentencing laws created in the 1980s during America’s war on drugs.

As a result, Angelos may not live long enough to experience freedom again. His case has haunted the federal judge that put him there.

""I do think about Angelos,” said Paul Cassell, a now-retired federal judge in the Utah circuit. “I sometimes drive near the prison where he’s held, and I think, ‘Gosh he shouldn’t be there. Certainly not as long as I had to send him there. ... That wasn’t the right thing to do. The system forced me to do it.”

Back in 2002, Angelos was an aspiring music producer and a father of two young boys living in Salt Lake City. Determined to make it big, he founded his own record company, eventually collaborating with big names like Snoop Dogg. But Angelos told ABC News he also started dealing pot on the side.

Federal authorities caught wind of Angelos’s dealings and set up three stings, using a criminal informant to buy about $1,000 worth of marijuana from him. But one critical detail made this case extraordinary -- during the deals, the criminal informant claimed Angelos had a gun in his possession.

The case went to federal court and Angelos was convicted of selling narcotics while in possession of a firearm. These offenses fall under mandatory minimum sentencing laws, and prosecutors treated each of the three marijuana deals as its own individual offense. This is what is called “stacking” the charges, and it means Angelos was facing three prison terms, stacked on top of each other. All in-- 55 years in prison, with no possibility of parole.

""A mandatory minimum is a sentence that says a judge has to impose a particular minimum number of years,” Cassell said. “It ties the judge’s hands… mandatory minimums can be used to send a message, but at some point the message gets lost.”

As many as 210,000 prisoners like Angelos are serving decades behind bars for non-violent crimes. The group Families Against Mandatory Minimums (FAMM) has complied hundreds of cases of non-violent offenders serving out what they call extreme prison sentences.

“The drug war totally drove the mandatory minimums that we’re still dealing with today” said Julie Stewart, founder of FAMM. “We have escalated punishments to the point that it’s crazy… Why does any non-violent offenders need to spend more than ten years in prison? Even that is a huge amount of time.”

Paul Cassell, who was appointed by President George W. Bush, now teaches law at the University of Utah. But he says the Angelos case still weighs on him, which is the reason he agreed to speak to “Nightline” about his ruling, something federal judges rarely do.

When Cassell delivered his ruling in the Angelos case, he was quick to point out how severe the sentence seemed compared to other, violent crimes.

“If he had been an aircraft hijacker, he would have gotten 24 years in prison. If he’s been a terrorist, he would have gotten 20 years in prison. If he was a child rapist, he would have gotten 11 years in prison. And now I’m supposed to give him a 55-year sentence? I mean, that’s just not right,”

“I think that most of the time, our federal justice system succeeds,” Cassell continued. “But there are some cases where it fails and the Angelos case is a prime example of that.”

Keeping offenders like Angelos in prison for virtual life sentences is also a heavy burden on the taxpayer -- Angelos alone will cost an estimated $1.5 million dollars by the time his sentence is through.

“I thought the sentence was utterly unjust to Weldon Angelos, but also unjust to the taxpayer,” Cassell pointed out. “I think it’s just a waste of resources to lock him up for 55 years, I don’t really think anyone believe that’s an appropriate sentence.""

Since Utah has no federal prisons, Angelos was sent to serve his time at a prison in California, thousands of miles away from his family.

Lisa Angelos remembers vividly the day when her brother was sentenced.

“The one thing he did say to me was that, we’ll never forget, he said ‘please, please help save my life,’ and I told him for as long as it takes, I will,” she said.

Lisa has made good on that promise, writing petitions, filing appeals, even testifying against the use of mandatory minimums in Congress. She’s partnered up with Families Against Mandatory Minimums to campaign for her brother’s release. But after years of trying, the only way Weldon Angelos will leave prison early is if he receives a commutation from President Obama.

""The President has to say, you have served enough time. It’s time to let you out,” says Julie Stewart, the president of FAMM, “And I’m optimistic that he will do that. Because Weldon’s case is an outrage.”

Lisa Angelos knows getting a presidential commutation is no easy task, but feels like her brother’s case may be strong enough. “I look at it and it doesn’t make sense. It’s like pennies worth of marijuana, how can somebody be doing life for that?”

Weldon Angelos is now 35 years old. He’ll be 78 by the time his 55 years are up.

His two young sons, Anthony and Jesse, are now teenagers, and haven’t seen their father for seven years—the last time they were able to buy a trip out to California.

“Being around them you can feel their heart ache, even though their laughter, and watching them play and do the fun stuff, you can still feel it,” Lisa Angelos said. “Seeing what they have gone through by losing their father, it just emotionally destroys me.”

Nearly every week, the boys talk on the phone with their father. During one such phone call, Weldon Angelos was able to talk to “Nightline” briefly.

“I mean it’s difficult to understand. I thought my sentence was definitely unnecessary,” Angelos said. “A 55-year sentence is not going to do any more than a five or 10 year sentence would have done, except take more of my life.”

Lisa said she will continue to fight for her brother’s freedom.

“To think that he will be in there until he is nearly 80 years old, I can’t give up on him, I just can’t do it,” she said."

Greg Abbott Says Constitution Trumps ‘Compassion’ for Undocumented Immigrants - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/exclusive-texas-gov-greg-abbott-rule-law-trumps/story?id=29218207,"Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told ABC News the Constitution trumps “compassion” for undocumented immigrants.

In an exclusive interview with ABC News and Fusion inside the ornate governor’s mansion in Austin, Texas, Abbott, whose federal lawsuit stopped President Obama’s executive action protecting millions from deportation, admitted he has no solution for what to do with the 11 million undocumented people living and working in the United States today. He said that’s not his responsibility, its President Obama’s.

“As the governor of Texas, I don’t have the luxury of making that decision. That is the job of the United States Congress and the president,” Abbott said. “And [that is] the reason why we have this lawsuit.”

Undocumented immigrants, many of whom are already paying taxes and have no criminal history, were granted legal status by President Obama’s executive action taken last November.

A federal judge earlier this month blocked Obama’s plans to allow more undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children and undocumented parents of U.S. citizens to remain in the U.S. without fear of deportation. The judge was ruling on a lawsuit filed by Abbott when he was the Texas attorney general.

That is being appealed by the Obama administration. The administration filed an emergency stay this week to allow applicants to his immigration programs to register while the lawsuit moves through the court system.

Abbott claims Obama's executive action overstepped his authority.

“What the president did here was to trample the rule of law,” Abbott told ABC News. “The president is being a dictator by issuing laws in contradiction of his power under the United States Constitution.”

A study this week by a pro-immigration reform group put the cost of deporting 11 million undocumented currently living in the United States at $50 billion.

Abbott told ABC News more should be spent on border security, even though the Department of Homeland Security says fewer immigrants are crossing America’s southern frontier than they have since the 1970s.

Undocumented families interviewed by ABC News said they want the governor to know the issue is not about a “political battle” with the president, it’s about their lives.

""I've got compassion for everyone,"" Abbott told ABC News in response. ""But in the Constitution, it requires the president to follow the law. There's no article or Bill of Rights in the Constitution that says compassion allows the president to circumvent the rules of the Constitution. And that's exactly what the president has done.""

The suspect, Richard White, 62, died at an area hospital yesterday after he underwent surgery for gunshot wounds, according to the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office.

He was a Jehovah's Witness, and ""refused"" certain types of medical care, Jefferson Parish Sheriff Newell Normand said at a press conference Saturday. He added that there was also a ""mental illness component.""

Authorities searched a bag the suspect dropped in the security area and found several Molotov cocktails and a search of his abandoned car revealed smoke bombs and chemical tanks, Normand said.

What the suspect intended to do with the tanks and what triggered the attack remained unknown, the sheriff said.

White entered the TSA pre-line shortly before 8 p.m. Friday, and was challenged by an agent who was checking boarding passes to be scanned, Normand said. He sprayed the agent in the face with the insecticide and continued past the checkpoint, he said.

Two more TSA agents then confronted White, according to police. He sprayed one male agent with the wasp spray before pulling a machete from his waistband and swinging it at him and a female agent.

""The male TSA officer grabbed a piece of luggage in order to defend himself,"" Normand said.

White chased the male agent through a metal detector before he was shot three times -- once in the chest, once in the leg, and once in the face -- by Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Lt. Heather Sylve, police said.

A bullet from Sylve's gun also hit the female TSA agent who was running from White. She suffered a non life-threatening injury, police said.

Normand said it did not appear that White was trying to get on a plane. A statement from the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office said his criminal history consisted of a few minor arrests.

Jeh Johnson, secretary of Homeland Security, called the attack a ""senseless act of violence,"" in a statement released Saturday.

Johnson said this incident is a ""reminder of the variety of threats we face and the important work that the men and women of the Transportation Security Administration do every day to keep millions of passengers traveling through our airports safe.""

Farah Stockman, a columnist for the Boston Globe visiting New Orleans for the weekend, said she saw people scrambling for safety as she walked out of the airport bathroom.

""Everybody was yelling and diving for cover and my husband said 'Stay where you are,'"" she recalled. ""It was just a lot of -- a lot of terrified people in an airport not knowing what was going on.""

Garret Laborde, who was trying to fly to Houston, called the incident ""instant chaos.""

""Everyone was ducking for cover. It's New Orleans. I knew they (the gunshots) were coming from the security checkpoint area,"" he said. ""I immediately ducked down. ... Then we waited.""

Kyle Waring, 27, of Manchester-by-the-Sea, about 30 miles outside Boston, said he anticipates to deliver snow at least until July by shipping ""snow"" from ice rinks. And when that runs cold, he's turning his attention to another website he launched this week: ShipFoliage.com.

Waring, a product manager that started ShipSnowYo.com last month, said he has sold about 150 orders of snow so far, shipping as far away as Florida and California.

His friends and family think he's ""extremely creative,"" he said.

""My friends and family are really proud of me for coming up with a simple idea. My colleagues are really thrilled about it,” he said. “They think I’m completely crazy in a good way. It works well for me because I have to be fairly creative at work.”

Using insulated packaging similar to what's used for Omaha steaks, Waring will ship to anyone who wants the snow, even residents of Connecticut and New York. The only exception is Massachusetts.

""We're in the business of expunging snow,"" his website states.

If or when the snow runs out in Massachusetts, he will likely have to charge more for the potential product from ice rinks, he said.

""I’m not as concerned but the best snow is fresh snow,"" he said.

His wife has been busy helping him during the day while he's at work, but he also has a simple system to collect snow.

""I just leave Styrofoam boxes outside and let snow fall into the boxes,"" he said.

Waring says what he's doing is perfectly legal, after consulting with a lawyer.

Gleaning basic information from customers' personal messages, he's learned that his customers vary.

""Most of my orders come from Bostonians right now and they ship to friends and family, mostly kids,"" he said. ""I’m thinking this might be the first time they’ve ever seen snow."""

The video from Wednesday afternoon shows the van bump into a wall before one of the suspects puts it in reverse and they drive away. The van was en route home from Urban Out Sitters's doggy day care, a company that offers pet boarding, day care and dog walking services.

The van and the seven dogs were found about 11 a.m. today, said police. No arrests have been made.

The dogs ""appear to be fine,"" according to police.

Tad Tomita, the owner of one of the stolen dogs -- a 3-year-old miniature schnauzer named Mochi -- told ABC News today, ""We picked her up from where the van was found. She was cold but extremely happy to see us.""

Tomita said his wife texted him saying their dog Mochi had been stolen.

""I didn't understand what that meant,"" Tomita said. ""When I called her and she told me what happened, I couldn't comprehend what was going on. It's so surreal.""

When a witness tried to intervene, one man drew a gun and pointed it at him, police said. The surveillance video does not show either man brandish a gun.

The van's driver was uninjured during the incident, according to Joseph Giannini, owner of Urban Out Sitters.

Tomita said he and his mother spent the morning driving around the Southwest side of the city searching for Mochi.

Giannini, who said he also drove around Chicago this morning looking for the van, was especially concerned because of the record-low temperatures. It reached -8 degrees in Chicago overnight."

The woman first felt sick on March 2, after drinking a smoothie, according to the Boulder County Sheriff's Office. While she noticed the smell of bleach from her glass, the woman assumed her daughter hadn't rinsed it properly, according to the sheriff's office.

Then a few days later, the mother again recognized the smell of bleach coming from something she was going to drink and she confronted the pre-teen, the sheriff's office said. The girl allegedly told her she wanted to kill her because she took away her iPhone, according to the sheriff's office.

The girl had allegedly poured bleach into her mother's water carafe, the sheriff's office said.

On March 6, the mother was at the Boulder Community Hospital when she contacted authorities to investigate.

The woman is no longer in the hospital and is in fine condition, the sheriff's office said today.

On Friday, the 12-year-old was detained at the Boulder County Juvenile Center on two counts of attempted first-degree murder, according to the sheriff's office.

""She had pre-planned this a couple different times,"" Sgt. Bill Crist of the sheriff's office said.

The investigation is ongoing, and the District Attorney's office will decide what charges to pursue, according to the sheriff's office."

The King Pine lift was in full operation this morning when it suddenly stopped and then started to go backwards, according to a spokeswoman for the Maine ski area.

The lift was immediately shut down and all available mountain safety personnel were sent to the scene to evacuate the skiers on the chair, the Maine ski resort said in a statement.

The injured guests were treated by ski patrol and were transported off the mountain. They were to be treated by emergency medical responders who were on site, the statement said.

Four people were taken to local hospitals with non-critical injuries, the hospital said this afternoon, adding that all three are in stable condition.

""There was definitely panic,"" said Hank Margolis, who was on the ski lift about a few hundred feet away.

""We heard people screaming,"" Margolis told ABC News. ""Everyone was standing in the lift line concerned about people jumping into them. They were screaming and running away.""

""There were people lying on the ground, they were definitely immobile,"" Margolis added.

Robin Lepage said her 23-year-old daughter was at the top of the lift and about to get off when the chair started moving backwards.

""They moved the bar back down and held on for dear life,"" Lepage told ABC News. ""She said they stopped about half-way down and came to a grinding halt.""

The chair then ""swayed and hung there"" for about an hour until they made it safely to the ground, Lepage said.

The lift was closed and the cause of the accident was under investigation, the statement from Sugarloaf said."

That phrase rings true for a Florida family that lost Stephen Merrill, 31, who loved superhero comics so much that they wrote in his obituary on Sunday that he passed away due to an ""uppercut from Batman.""

Merrill, a father of a 7-year-old boy, died unexpectedly at home in Winter Haven, Florida, on Feb. 12, and the family didn't know the cause of death when they wanted to submit an obituary before his funeral, his sister Kimberly Merrill told ABC News today. Their dad suggested they just make up something ""exotic,"" she said.

""One of Stephen's friends Brandon Moxam suggested to say he died from Batman's uppercut because he was a huge Batman fan,"" his sister said. ""Everyone laughed, and we knew that was what Stephen would've wanted us to say.""

The Ledger, based in Lakeland, Florida, was resistant to publishing the obituary at first, but after Stephen's close friend Andrew Albreacht told the manager of the obituaries department it would mean the world to them to honor Stephen in this way, the newspaper finally agreed, his sister said.

The funeral on Tuesday was just as unconventional as Stephen's obituary, his fiancee Stephanie Vella told ABC News.

""It was more of a celebration of his life rather than a funeral,"" Vella said. ""A bunch of us wore superhero t-shirts or bright colors, we told funny stories about Stephen and of course, we played some music from some of his favorite superhero movies like 'Star Spangled Man' from 'Captain America' and the 'Evolution of Batman.'""

There was even a ""Captain America"" shield flower arrangement made from roses and carnations, Vella said.

""Stephen was the family's superhero,"" Vella said. ""He was the glue that held the family together. He had so many legitimate reasons to not be positive, but he always remained so positive. He was so kind and caring.""

Merrill was diagnosed with testicular cancer near the end of June 2013, and has gone in and out of remission and the hospital for the past two years, Vella said, adding he was just about to start aggressive chemotherapy before his death. But despite all this, he remained a ray of light to the family, she said.

""He was a big kid,"" she added. ""There was nothing he liked better than playing 'Lego Batman' with our son Noah on the Xbox. Noah is also a huge fan of superheroes and Legos, and he always loved telling people his daddy worked at Legoland.""

Vella said every day is a struggle for her.

""I want to tell him, 'Babe, I know you’re looking down on all of us right now, and before you passed you questioned if you had done enough with your life and what your legacy would be,'"" Vella said. ""But this is your legacy. Look at how many lives you've touched, people you've made laugh and the mark you've left on this world.""

Vella said she is having a ""Batman"" tattoo designed for her to pay tribute to Stephen.

The family has since found out the cause of death, but the family has asked ABC News not to disclose it."
1LkHwBY,2015-01-29 00:00:00,'Sunset' Deadline Passes for ISIS Prisoner Swap - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/International/sunset-deadline-looms-isis-prisoner-swap/story?id=28572151,"The deadline for a prisoner swap that the terror group ISIS said would save the life of a Jordanian hostage has passed, apparently with no news of the swap taking place.

Through a message from Japanese hostage Kenji Goto, ISIS had demanded the government of Jordan release al Qaeda convict Sajida al-Rishawi and bring her to the border with Turkey by ""sunset"" Mosul time, meaning mid-morning East Coast time, in exchange for Goto's freedom. If Jordan refused, ISIS said it would kill a captured Jordanian pilot, Lt. Muath al-Kaseasbeh.

But just before the sun set in Mosul, a spokesperson for the Jordanian government said ISIS had yet to provide proof that al-Kaseasbeh was still alive.

Jordan’s government has said it would go through with a prisoner swap in order to get its captured pilot back, but Goto's message did not say the Jordanian pilot would be freed in the newly-proposed arrangement. Al-Kaseasbeh was captured by ISIS last December after his aircraft was shot down.

Al-Rishawi, the Iraqi woman ISIS is bent on freeing, has been on death row in Jordan since she confessed to her role as a would-be suicide bomber in a string of al Qaeda attacks in Jordan in 2005 that killed dozens.

Kenji Goto's wife, Rinko, released a statement this morning, saying she has been in contact with those holding her husband for weeks, and last received a message from them demanding that she publicize the proposed exchange with the Jordanian government.

""I fear that his is the last chance for my husband and we now have only a few hours left to secure his release and the life of Lt. Muath al-Kaseasbeh. I beg the Jordanian and Japanese Government to understand the fates of both men are in their hands,"" she said. ""I pray for the lives of my husband and the Jordanian pilot Lt. Muath al-Kaseasbeh.""

Junko Ishido, Goto's mother, said after the passing of the deadline that she was ""disappointed.""

“But I just can’t feel helpless,” Ishido said, according to the Japanese news agency NHK. “We have to think how the captors will follow through [with] their promise to release my son. We can’t just give up hope.”

Prior to reports of Jordan’s willingness to accept the trade, Middle East expert Jon Alterman told ABC News that by asking for, and potentially gaining al-Rishawi’s release, ISIS is attempting to bolster its long-held goal of being seen as a proper nation-state on a geopolitical scale.

“What it represents is ISIS again trying to act like a real country. It’s a small group of outlaws trying to engage in governments,” Alterman, head of the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said Tuesday.

ISIS, the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, has publicly beheaded dozens of captives, including a handful of Western journalists and aid workers, sometimes after making demands of their governments.

The family-friendly breed of dogs is atop the American Kennel Club’s list of the Most Popular Dogs in the U.S., for the 24th consecutive year.

“The Lab truly is America’s dog,” AKC Vice President Gina DiNardo said in a statement.

The AKC’s 2014 list, released today, shows German shepherds, golden retrievers, bulldogs and beagles following Labrador retrievers in the top five.

The beagle, which ranked number five on the AKC list, saw its breed get attention earlier this year when a Beagle named Miss P, from British Columbia, took home the top Best in Show honor at the Westminster Kennel Club Show earlier this month.

The AKC's most popular list is derived from the number of dogs within each breed registered with the club, an AKC spokeswoman told ABC News.

The bulldog moved up one spot, into number four, above the beagle, on this year's list. The AKC attributes the bulldogs' rise to the breeds’, “natural tendency to form strong bonds with kids, an easy-to-care-for coat and minimal exercise needs. “

A more specific type of Bulldog, the French bulldog, moved into the top 10, at number nine, this year for the first time in nearly 100 years, according to the AKC.

The Labrador retriever’s spot atop the Most Popular Breeds’ list continues its streak as the longest reign in AKC history.

Here is the full top 10 list of the 2014 Most Popular Dogs in the U.S.

1. Labrador Retriever

2. German Shepherd Dog

3. Golden Retriever

4. Bulldog

5. Beagle

6. Yorkshire Terrier

7. Poodle

Why was it unique? Yasmin Eleby had arranged a surprise marriage ceremony ... in which she married herself.

""I’d been saying a few years that if I hadn't gotten married by the time I was 40, I’d just have a wedding by myself,"" Eleby told ABC News today. ""I decided I didn't want it to be a joke. I wanted to have a celebration of myself. My wedding was going to be about me making a commitment to love myself, to honor myself and to know my self-worth.""

So Eleby got in touch with event planner Darrel Colone, who said she was the easiest and hardest client he ever had to work with.

""She's a kindergarten teacher in Saudi Arabia, so she's only in the Texas area once or twice a year,"" Colone told ABC News. ""We planned everything mostly through email, Facebook message and text.""

Eleby said she started planning her Jan. 3 ""wedding"" during late-July 2014.

Colone said he loved that Eleby decided to plan such an unconventional event, so he chose an equally unusual venue -- the Houston Museum of African American Culture.

""We were allowed to choose an exhibit to have in the gallery area, where guests would arrive, and we chose 'Women of the New Tribe,' Colone said. ""They were pictures of strong African American women in the country that reflected the strong, independent, cultured and well-traveled woman Yasmin was.""

When Eleby arrived at the museum, guests were escorted to the ceremony space complete with candles, purple ambient light and beautiful flowers.

""Everyone was so amazed when they saw the room,"" Colone said. ""They were like, 'Is this a wedding? A wedding? What's going on!'""

That's when Eleby said she came dancing down the aisle to Stevie Wonder's ""Isn't She Lovely,"" along with her mother and bridesmaid. She was wearing a purple gown because purple is her favorite color. The dance ended at the altar in the center of the room. Colone said he arranged for Eleby to be in the middle of the guests arranged in a circle because he wanted her to be the center of attention.

Three ministers -- her eldest sister, a niece and friend -- then asked together, ""Who thinks Yasmin is 40 and fabulous?"" Colone said. He added that the 160 guests in the room chimed, ""We do!""

The ceremony's mood changed, Yasmin said, when she started saying her vows to herself with the help of her ministers. They were on committing to forgive, love and honor yourself, she said.

""The advice and speeches given during my vows weren’t just for me,"" Eleby said. ""Everyone there started reflecting on their life on how you have to forgive yourself for the past and know you are a worthy human being worthy of love. You first have to love yourself. The more love you have yourself, the more you can love others.""

There was barely a dry eye in the room, Colone said, especially when Eleby sang, ""I Believe I Can Fly,"" at the end of the ceremony.

Eleby said she was overwhelmed and started crying herself when she sang the second verse: ""There are miracles in this life that I must achieve, but I know first that it starts inside of me.""

The tears were quickly wiped away by the lavish reception afterwards, Colone said.

""Her first dance was a line dance strut with her Delta sorority sisters,"" Colone said. ""The reception was amazing. She had everything -- four food stations with all the food anyone could possibly want, a photo booth, a live band, a D.J., and even a 5-foot-tall elephant ice sculpture. The kids even had their own room, so the parents could enjoy their adult fun on the floor.""

Eleby is now back teaching kindergartners at a multinational school in Saudi Arabia. She said she recently had a second, smaller wedding and birthday celebration this past weekend with her friends there.

Though some people have tried to say Eleby's marriage to herself is ridiculous, she said she doesn't let it get to her.

""If they don’t understand the concept of self-love, I really don’t know what to say to them,"" Eleby told ABC News. ""I have no words but, 'I am fabulous.' What I want people to take away from this is that they are worthy of love and forgiveness no matter what they've done in the past.""

Eleby also revealed to ABC News that she is dating someone right now.

""I don’t know if marriage is in the future or not,"" she said. ""I've thought that about my past relationships, but they all ended amicably because they just weren't going.""

Two of her exes actually attended her wedding in Houston.

""This is something you'd do, totally up your ally,"" Eleby said they told her."

Her father, Patrick Quarles, said the incident was no accident.

""On the day of the injury, Gwendolyn was in gym class and the coaches left the children alone,"" Quarles, a 43-year-old sales representative for an electrical supply company, told ABC News. ""There seems to have been an argument and then she remembers a ball flying at her.""

After complaining of a floating feeling, the 11-year-old was sent to the nurse, her father said. Later in the day her parents took her to the emergency room near her home in Austin, Texas, where she was diagnosed with intracranial hypertension, a rare disorder where pressure inside the skull chokes off the optic nerve from the brain.

The girl's mother, Erin Quarles, said that doctors have told the family that they cannot definitively confirm that the disorder is a result of the injury, but according to the Intracranial Hypertension Foundation, the condition is usually the result of a severe head injury.

The school where the incident occurred is The Founder's Classic Academy, part of the Responsive Education Solutions, a charter school system in Texas. Mary Ann Duncan, vice president of school operations for RES, said they wished the child a speedy recovery but would neither confirm nor deny the incident occurred.

""We are not allowed to speak about confidential student information but the school's policy is to investigate and notify parents promptly of any accident or bullying,"" Duncan said.

It's unclear whether Quarles will completely recover from the injury, said her parents, who fear she may go blind even if she undergoes risky and expensive surgery. Besides problems with her eyesight, her father said she was also experiencing other difficulties.

""She sometimes has trouble understanding me and sometimes she will trip over things. It comes and goes,"" he said, though her mother said her daughter's symptoms have improved in the last several days.

Gwendolyn is at the prime age for being bullied, according to government statistics. About a third of children report being threatened at school, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the likelihood of bullying peaks in the middle school years when kids are age 10 to 14.

""Kids who are bullied have higher rates of anxiety and depression and lower self-esteem,"" said Dr. Joe Shrand, the medical director of CASTLE, an adolescent addiction treatment center in Brockton, Massachusetts.

Though only a small percentage of bullying turns physical, Shrand said kids who are bullied have a higher risk of physical ailments such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes and suicide throughout their lifetime. Sometimes kids who are bullied turn the tables and become ""victim bullies"" perpetuating the cycle, he added.

Quarles said his family has racked up substantial medical bills as a result of his daughter's condition, only some of which has been covered by insurance. The family has started a GoFundMe.com campaign to help cover the out-of-pocket costs, which Quarles said are piling up quickly.

The Quarles said they sent at least 23 emails to the school, warning them that she was being pushed around by a group of other girls and that they feared the situation might escalate into something physical, Patrick Quarles said. The school did make attempts to remedy the situation, the parents said, but they wish everyone -- themselves included -- had done more.

And when something actually happened, he said he and his wife were in shock.

""You think, 'What’s the worst that can happen?' But you never think this,"" Quarles said.

Since no adult was present when it happened, it's impossible to get the entire story, Quarles said, added that the family does not plan to sue."

Sen. Jim Inhofe, a devoted climate change denier, tossed a snowball at someone on the Senate floor today as he tried to debunk climate change.

“In case we had forgotten because we keep hearing that 2014 has been the warmest year on record, I ask the chair: You know what this is? It's a snowball and that just from outside here so it's very, very cold out. Very unseasonal,” he said.

“So, Mr. President, catch this,” Inhofe, R-Okla., said on the Senate floor, tossing the snowball to someone off-screen as he tried to suppress a smile.

“We hear the perpetual headline that 2014 has been the warmest year on record but now the script has flipped and I think it's important since we hear it over and over and over,” Inhofe, 80, said. “As we can see with the snowball out there, this is today. This is reality.”

This isn't the first time Inhofe has used snow to make a point about climate change. After a massive snowstorm in the Washington, D.C., area in 2010, Inhofe and his family famously built an igloo and labeled it ""Al Gore's New Home.""

The Environmental Protection Agency's website says, ""Rising global average temperature is associated with widespread changes in weather patterns. Scientific studies indicate that extreme weather events such as heat waves and large storms are likely to become more frequent or more intense with human-induced climate change.""

Speaking on the Senate floor later in the afternoon, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, one of the Senate’s strongest environmental advocates, used figures from scientific studies to rebut Inhofe’s theory.

“You can believe every single major American scientific society or you can believe the senator with the snowball,” Whitehouse, D-R.I., said."

Lomas was in the home with Brown's partner Nick Gordon when the 21-year-old daughter of singers Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown was discovered face down in her tub on Saturday, according to local police.

""It is our understanding that Mr. Lomas has cooperated with the authorities investigating what happened involving his dear friend,"" Lomas' lawyer said in a statement to ABC News. ""Mr. Lomas is deeply concerned for Ms. Brown and remains hopeful for her full, complete and swift recovery.""

The statement continued, ""Mr. Lomas' widely reported recent arrest is completely unrelated to the incident that occurred at Ms. Brown's residence and there is absolutely no relationship between the two events. He has pleaded not guilty to those charges.""

After being found over the weekend, Brown was rushed to North Fulton Hospital in Roswell, where she had been treated, but sources have told ABC News that she has since been moved to the Neurology Intensive Care Unit of Emory University Hospital.

According to the police report, Lomas was the one who initially called the cops, while Gordon administered CPR.

""Mr. Lomas has not been accused of anything in connection with Bobbi Kristina Brown's injuries and is a witness in this investigation,"" his lawyer added. ""Mr. Lomas' main focus is on Ms. Brown's full recovery and he continues to pray for her and her entire family throughout this tragedy.""

A couple of days after the incident, the Houston family released a statement about Brown's condition that seconded sentiments shared previously by her father Bobby Brown.

“Bobbi Kristina is fighting for her life and is surrounded by immediate family,"" the Houston family said in a statement. ""As her father already stated, we are asking you to honor our request for privacy during this difficult time. Thank you for your prayers, well wishes, and we greatly appreciate your continued support.""

Also, despite public claims from Bobbi Kristina Brown, including a 2014 social media posting that she had married Nick Gordon, her father’s lawyer said earlier this week that the two have never married.

""We are currently investigating the events that led to the hospitalization of Bobbi Kristina,"" Christopher Brown of Brown & Rosen LLC, legal counsel for her father, Bobby Brown, told ABC News. ""To correct earlier reports, Bobbi Kristina is not and has never been married to Nick Gordon.”

ABC News' Eric Jones, Lesley Messer, Jennifer Harrison and Dean Schabner contributed to this report."

Cheshire was married to Luke's late sister Kelly, who died in 2007, and now, Bryan and his family are helping their three children cope with the devastating loss.

""We feel like if we just stay positive through this, maybe we'll be a positive inspiration for people that had these things happen to 'em,"" Bryan told ABC News. ""You just have to plow on and play the hand that's dealt.""

The singer said that his nephew, 13-year-old Til, has come to live in Nashville with him, his wife, Caroline, and their two sons, Bo and Tate. Til's two older sisters come in regularly to visit too, and Bryan said he's thankful he has the means to fly them there.

""It's every day on the phone all day trying to talk with the family and figure out what to do, but it's what you gotta do,"" he said. ""Tough stuff.""

Bryan admitted that he and Caroline are exhausted at the end of every day, but he tries to stay positive and tells himself that this is all part of God's plan.

""You know, we just stay positive. I think people expect that from me,"" he said. ""I have to pray that people that have had similar situations can maybe look at my family and see me positively dealing with it. I'm not saying it's easy.""

Bryan has drawn support from the country music family, too. His friends in Lady Antebellum teamed up with songwriter Chris Stapleton to perform his hit, ""Drink A Beer,"" on the CMT Artists of the Year special in early December. The song had deep personal meaning for Bryan, who recorded it in memory of his late sister and his brother, Chris, who was killed in a car accident in the mid-'90s.

The relatives stood along the bank of the Keelung River, praying. Some people cried as they viewed the wreckage for the first time.

Footage of the jet’s descent was captured on dashcam video from Taiwan’s National Freeway No. 1. The plane could be seen veering sharply, with the wing striking a vehicle and barrier before careening into the river.

Moments before the jet banked sharply and crashed into the river, one of its pilots said, “Mayday, mayday, engine flameout,” according to a Taiwanese aviation official.

Taiwan's Civil Aeronautical Administration released a snippet of audio including the pilot's mayday call. An agency official who declined to be named confirmed the mayday distress call on Thursday but did not say how it might relate to a cause for the crash.

Both the administration and the airline, Taipei-based TransAsia Airways, declined to speculate on causes for the crash at about 10:55 a.m. near the capital city's downtown airport. The plane's black box was found overnight. The pilots' bodies have not yet been recovered.

1LqeoGF,2015-02-22 00:00:00,Kurt Busch's final appeal denied - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/kurt-buschs-final-appeal-denied/story?id=29134698,"NASCAR suspended the Stewart-Haas Racing driver Friday after the release of a Kent County (Delaware) Family Court commissioner opinion that detailed why he believed Busch had committed an act of domestic violence against ex-girlfriend Patricia Driscoll.

Busch lost his initial appeal to a three-member NASCAR-appointed panel Saturday afternoon and then made an appeal Saturday night to NASCAR Final Appeals Officer Bryan Moss. A former president of Gulfstream who was named as NASCAR's top appeals boss in 2014, Moss had not ruled on any final appeal until Saturday night.

""We are unhappy with the latest decision to deny our re-appeal, but we will continue to exhaust every procedural and legal remedy we have available to us until Kurt Busch is vindicated,"" Busch's attorney, Rusty Hardin, said. ""Along the way we intend to continue to call attention to the facts and witnesses that will shed light on Ms. Driscoll's true character, motivations and history.""

Busch remains suspended indefinitely.

""Kurt Busch now has exhausted his appeal options under the NASCAR rulebook, and the indefinite suspension remains in effect,"" NASCAR said in a statement Saturday night. ""He will not be allowed to race nor participate in any NASCAR activities until further notice.''

SHR co-owner Gene Haas, who funds the car specifically for Busch on his own and has his company Haas Automation logos on Busch's uniform and car, said Sunday morning he had nothing to say about Busch's suspension and he would not say whether he will continue to field the No. 41 car for another driver.

Spokesman David Higdon said Saturday night that NASCAR will create guidelines that Busch must meet in order to return, guidelines that Busch will receive ""very soon."" Higdon would not discuss the guidelines and did not say whether counseling will be included.

Higdon said that the decision is final as it relates to the case right now, but he would not speculate what would happen if criminal charges are filed over the Sept. 26 altercation between Busch and Driscoll at Dover International Speedway. If charges are not filed, it would not impact the guidelines that Busch must complete for NASCAR, Higdon said.

The decision means both Busch brothers are out of the ""Great American Race"" for the first time since 2000. Younger brother Kyle was ruled out with right leg breaks suffered in a frightening crash Saturday in the Xfinity Series season opener at Daytona International Speedway.

A three-member panel of former NASCAR executive Paul Brooks, former race-car driver Lyn St. James and Greenville Pickens (South Carolina) Speedway track owner Kevin Whitaker voted Saturday afternoon to deny Busch's initial appeal as the 2004 Sprint Cup champion attempted to become eligible for the sport's biggest race.

Even if Busch had won the appeal, it was far from a guarantee he would race Sunday in the Daytona 500. Chevrolet, a major SHR sponsor, has suspended its personal services relationship with Busch."

The Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota, issued a statement Saturday, saying it had increased security in light of the video purportedly from al-Shabab, which took credit for the deadly attack at a Kenyan mall that killed at least 67 civilians in 2013.

""Groups like ISIL [ISIS], al-Shabab, AQAP (al Qaeda of the Arabian Peninsula) are now publicly calling for attacks either through the internet, through videos, through publications, which means that we need to respond militarily but we also have to have a whole government approach through law enforcement, homeland security and frankly countering violent extremism efforts here in the homeland in communities,"" Johnson said on ABC's ""This Week."" ""We’re in a new phase now and I’m afraid that this most recent video release reflects that.""

Matt Olsen, former director of the National Counterterrorism Center and current ABC News consultant, said despite al-Shabab not having a known ability to carry out such an attack in the U.S., the threat must still be considered.

""Over the past few years, al-Shabab has been degraded overall, but it is still active in Somalia and parts of East Africa,"" said Olsen. ""al-Shabab has no known operational capacity in the U.S., and we haven't seen the group develop the ability to carry out a complex attack here. But this type of threat can't be discounted, and the FBI and local police departments will have to take appropriate steps in response.""

The Department of Homeland Security and FBI issued a joint statement Sunday, saying the agencies were aware of the ""reported call from al-Shabab for 'Westgate style' attacks against shopping centers around the world, to include in the United States.""

""In recent months, the FBI and DHS have worked closely with our state and local public safety counterparts and members of the private sector, to include mall owners and operators, to prevent and mitigate these types of threats,"" the statement continued.

1LqNYaw,2015-01-30 00:00:00,Mitt Romney Says No to 2016 Presidential Run - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/mitt-romney-2016-presidential-run/story?id=28604278,"For Mitt Romney, it appears that the third time is not the charm.

On a conference call with supporters on Friday, Romney said he was taking a pass on another White House bid.

“After putting considerable thought into making another run for president, I’ve decided it is best to give other leaders in the party the opportunity to become our next nominee,” Romney said.

Listen to an audio clip of the call:

Romney did not endorse any of the numerous potential Republican candidates who have expressed interest in running for president.

“I believe that one of our next generation of Republican leaders, one who may not be as well-known as I am today, one who has not yet taken their message across the country, one who is just getting started, may well emerge as being better able to defeat the Democrat[ic] nominee,"" Romney said. ""In fact, I expect and hope that to be the case.”

Romney has been flirting with another White House run in recent weeks, and looked like he was edging closer to a bid -- until today.

""I’ve been asked, and will certainly be asked again, if there are any circumstances whatsoever that might develop that could change my mind. That seems unlikely,"" Romney said. ""Accordingly, I’m not organizing a PAC or taking donations; I’m not hiring a campaign team.""

He then essentially released his donors, telling them they were free to support other candidates.

Just Thursday, Team Romney suffered a high-profile defection that agitated members of Romney’s inner circle when former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who is seriously considering a 2016 run, announced he was signing up David Kochel to oversee his exploratory efforts and ultimately run his campaign.

Kochel is one of the best Republican operatives in the business, based in Iowa, but involved in races across the country. He was a core part of Romney’s 2008 and 2012 teams, but he is also close to Mike Murphy and others in the Bushes' orbit.

Matt Rhoades, Romney's 2012 campaign manager, told ABC News: ""Mitt Romney is a good man who always does the right thing for his party and our country. Working for him is an experience I will always cherish. I look forward to seeing what new big challenge he tackles next.""

Though the former Republican presidential nominee's message on the call was clear, he also sounded notes of confidence, asserting that he was “convinced we can win the nomination” and would have enough funding to do so. But he acknowledged, it would be a “difficult task.”

He even said he would have the “best chance” to beat the Democratic nominee, specifically citing the new focus on poverty that he has been talking about in recent speaking appearances.

Nevertheless, Romney told supporters he did not want to make it ""more difficult for someone else to emerge who may have a better chance of becoming that president.""

He added, ""You can’t imagine how hard it is for Ann and me to step aside, especially knowing of your support and the support of so many people across the country.""

Romney ended the call without taking questions.

Romney and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, another potential 2016 contender, will dine together this evening, a source familiar with the plans told ABC News. This news, which was first reported by The New York Times, comes after the recent meeting between Jeb Bush and Romney last week.

Bush was among the first probable Republican White House hopefuls to weigh in on Romney's announcement.

""Though I’m sure today’s decision was not easy, I know that Mitt Romney will never stop advocating for renewing America’s promise through upward mobility, encouraging free enterprise and strengthening our national defense,"" Bush said in a statement. ""Mitt is a patriot and I join many in hoping his days of serving our nation and our party are not over.""

Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said of Romney: ""He certainly earned the right to consider running, so I deeply respect his decision to give the next generation a chance to lead.""

Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., noted: ""I hope to work together with him to grow our party and lead our country forward."""
1LRGSfE,2015-02-05 00:00:00,Dad Refuses to Give Up Newborn Son With Down Syndrome - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/dad-refuses-give-newborn-son-syndrome/story?id=28756025,"When Samuel Forrest of Armenia heard a baby crying from outside his wife's hospital room, he knew his life would change forever.

Not only had he become a father, but he would soon receive some unexpected news about his newborn son.

""This pediatrician walks out of the room with a little bundle -- that was Leo,"" Forrest said. ""She had his face covered up and hospital authorities wouldn't let me see him or my wife. When the doctor came out, he said 'there’s a real problem with your son.'

Forrest followed doctors and nurses into a room where he'd finally get to meet his baby.

""When I walked into the room they all turned to me and said 'Leo has Down syndrome,"" he told ABC News. ""I had a few moments of shock.""

After the news had sunk in, Forrest held Leo for the very first time.

""They took me in see him and I looked at this guy and I said, he's beautiful -- he's perfect and I'm absolutely keeping him.""

Soon Forrest walked into his wife's hospital room with Leo in his arms.

Her reaction was unlike one he ever expected.

""I got the ultimatum right then,"" he said. ""She told me if I kept him then we would get a divorce.""

Attempts to reach the hospital for comment weren't immediately successful. The baby's mother, Ruzan Badalyan, told ABC News that she did have a child with Down syndrome and she has left her husband, who has the child, but she declined to elaborate.

Forrest, who's from Auckland, New Zealand, said he was completely unaware of the hospital practices in Armenia when it came to children.

""What happens when a baby like this is born here, they will tell you that you don’t have to keep them,"" he said. ""My wife had already decided, so all of this was done behind my back.""

Despite his wife's warnings, Forrest said he never had a doubt in his mind that he would hold onto his son.

One week after his birth, Leo's mom filed for divorce.

""It's not what I want,"" Forrest said. ""I didn’t even have a chance to speak with her in privately about it.""

Forrest, who works as a freelance business contractor, has plans for he and Leo to move to his native country of New Zealand where he said they'll receive support from loved ones.

In the meantime, he's enlisted for some help on his GoFundMe page titled ""Bring Leo Home.""

""This really came out of the blue for me,"" he said. ""I don’t have a lot, I have very little in fact. The goal is to raise enough for a year so I can get a part-time job so Leo doesn't have to be in daycare and I can help care for him. He's lost a lot in two weeks. It'd be different if he had his mommy.""

Forrest has recently been working with disability awareness groups to share his story in the hopes that parents will become better educated on children with special needs.

""After what I've been through with Leo, I'm not going to sit back and watch babies be sent to orphanages,"" he said. ""As a child with Down syndrome, that becomes somewhat of a label. If we can get around this label, we’ll see that they’re normal. They’re a little different from us, but they’re still normal.

""They all have niches and I want to work hard to find out where Leo's special. This little guy is great."""

1LSSJXW,2015-03-02 00:00:00,"Boris Nemtsov, Vocal Critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, Shot Dead in Moscow - ABC News",http://abcnews.go.com/International/boris-nemtsov-vocal-critic-russian-president-vladimir-putin/story?id=29283658,"Boris Nemtsov, one of Russian President Vladimir Putin's most vocal and visible opponents was shot and killed near Moscow's Red Square today, a member of his political party told ABC News.

Nemtsov, a prominent opposition leader, was shot multiple times in the back as he walked by a bridge near the Kremlin late Friday night, according to Russia's Investigative Committee.

Russian news reports said that Nemtsov was walking with a female companion when a white car pulled up and fired on him before fleeing the scene.

Unidentified killers fired ""at least seven or eight shots"" at Nemtsov when the politician was walking on Bolshoy Kammeny Bridge in central Moscow, Russian Investigative Committee spokesman Vladimir Markin said.

""Witnesses to the killing are being questioned, and the crime scene is being carefully examined,"" Markin said.

Nemtsov was a former deputy prime minister under Boris Yeltsin during the 1990s, but fell out with the Russian president and formed Russia's People's Freedom Party.

The reason for the attack remains a mystery. A Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said President Putin was aware of the news and called it a provocation. ""Putin noted that this cruel murder has every sign of being a contract one which has solely provocative nature,"" Peskov said, according to the Interfax news agency.

""The president has ordered the leadership of the Investigative Committee, the Interior Ministry and the Federal Security Service to form an investigative group and keep the investigation of this crime under personal control,"" Peskov said.

""The Russian president expresses deep condolences to relatives and friends of Boris Nemtsov, who died tragically,"" Peskov added.

The former U.S. Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul tweeted: ""I cannot believe that they have killed my friend, Boris Nemtsov.""

Nemtsov's death comes just days before he was expected to take part in a large anti-Putin protest planned on Sunday.

Nemtsov was one of the organizers of large street protests against President Putin in recent years, always marching at the front of the crowd and addressing them from the stage.

He was the author of several reports on corruption in Russia, including attempts to estimate President Putin's wealth and the amount of money stolen during preparations for last year's Winter Olympics in Sochi.

""I was born in Russia and will die in this country,"" he told ABC News' Brian Ross in December 2013 when asked if he was afraid of being targeted for his opposition to President Putin.

""Everybody who against him must be very careful,"" he said.

Asked what motivated him, Nemtsov replied: ""I think that we must replace him because he did everything against an interest of my country; corruption, dependence on oil and gas, absence of technology, monopolization. He doesn't want to invest money to middle class. He forgets about health care and the population.""

""Russian authorities should thoroughly and impartially investigate Nemtsov's killing,"" said Tanya Cooper, Russia researcher at Human Rights Watch. ""The authorities need to consider all possible motivations for his killing, including Nemtsov's political activity.""

In an interview published today, Nemtsov told the Financial Times he believed U.S. sanctions on Russia were beginning to have an effect on Putin's popularity. Stagnant wages and soaring inflation topped the agenda when he met with residents of Yaroslavl, a town northeast of Moscow, last week.

""They believed that the embargo on imported foods is America's fault, and they were surprised when I told them no, that was not Obama, it was Putin,"" Nemtsov told the Financial Times. ""This is what we need to make people aware of the crisis. Putin's rating will not stay at above 80 per cent forever. It will start coming down, very gradually. And once it does, the fear will diminish, too, and at some point some big business will start supporting and financing us.""

Over the past year, as it has been wreaking havoc in Syria and Iraq and recruiting tens of thousands of fighters from around the world, ISIS has released several videos online showing the man with a distinctly British accent standing beside hostages from the United States and elsewhere as they were being beheaded.

The BBC and Washington Post Thursday identified “Jihadi John” as Mohammed Emwazi, a college graduate with a degree in computer programming who grew up in a part of London described by some as working class. He reportedly left for Syria in 2012 and then joined ISIS.

In the interview with ABC News, Holder refused to confirm those reports, insisting nothing “would be served” by revealing the true identity of the masked man.

“It would cut back any of the operational possibilities we have been considering,” Holder added.

Nevertheless, asked whether he can guarantee “Jihadi John” will face justice, Holder said: “The vow that I can make to the American people, along with our allies, is that we will hold accountable all of the people who have been responsible for these heinous, barbaric acts. ... That is something that we are focused on each and every day.”

President Obama echoed those sentiments, saying the United States is “consistent and we are patient.”

“Eventually, if you hurt an American, you are going to be brought to justice in some fashion,” the president said in an interview Thursday with ABC News’ Seattle affiliate, KOMO-TV. “I’m confident we will get the job done. ... It will take a little bit of time but in the end, this death cult that has developed there ... is a dead end.”"

The two performed in front of a backdrop of Alabama’s Edmund Pettus Bridge, where hundreds walked across in 1965 for the right to vote. It’s also the same bridge depicted in the Oscar-nominated film, “Selma.”

Joined by a plain-clothed choir, the performance brought the audience to their feet and tears to the eyes of “Selma” star David Oyelowo, who portrayed Martin Luther King, Jr. in the film, and even “Into the Woods” actor Chris Pine.

Celebs even chimed in via Twitter. “Scandal” star Bellamy Young tweeted, “Oh @common  @johnlegend u lift us up-w/ur words AND w/ur music.
TY 4making this world- &certainly this awards' season- a better place.”

Oh @common @johnlegend
u lift us up-

Actress Gabrielle Union said, “I'm awake now... John Legend and Common... im already getting my life! #Selma.”

I'm awake now... John Legend and Common... im already getting my life! #Selma

Afterwards, when Common accepted the Oscar for Best Original Song he explained that the bridge “was once a landmark of a divided nation, but now it’s a symbol for change.” John Legend added that “Selma is now, because the struggle for justice is right now.”

Legend later said he felt ""lifted"" during the performance.

""It felt like something special was happening, and then we finished and everyone was crying, people were standing, I felt so much love in the room,"" he told ABC's Robin Roberts.

""I felt like we were paying honor to Dr. King and all these people that fought for us and stood up for us. I felt like they were coming through the music,"" Common added."
1LVArYR,2015-02-06 00:00:00,Army Rules That Fort Hood Shooting Victims Will Receive the Purple Heart - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/army-rules-fort-hood-shooting-victims-receive-purple/story?id=28780956,"The Army has approved the awarding of the Purple Heart and a civilian counterpart medal to the soldiers and civilians wounded in the 2009 Fort Hood shooting after years of pressure from victims' families and Congress. Thirteen people were killed and 32 were injured in the shooting carried out by Major Nidal Hassan, an Army psychiatrist, military officials said today.

The move was precipitated by a change in the law that broadened the strict eligibility rules for the medal, which is awarded to those wounded in combat. The shooting victims were previously deemed not eligible for the award because the Nov. 5, 2009, shooting by Hassan was ruled by the military to be a workplace violence incident.

Advocates for the shooting victims have urged the Army for years to reconsider that assessment as a case of terrorism given that Hasan was in communication with Anwar al Awlaki, the American cleric who was a senior leader in Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP).

They gained support from members of Congress who succeeded in including legislation in the 2015 National Defense Authorization Act that broadened the definition of an attack by a “a foreign terrorist organization."" That would include contacts the perpetrator may have had with a foreign terrorist organization prior to the attack and “if the attack was inspired or motivated by the foreign terrorist organization.”

Army Secretary John McHugh has approved awarding the Purple Heart and its civilian counterpart, the Secretary of Defense Medal for the Defense of Freedom, according to an Army statement today.

""The Purple Heart's strict eligibility criteria had prevented us from awarding it to victims of the horrific attack at Fort Hood,"" McHugh explained in the statement.

""Now that Congress has changed the criteria, we believe there is sufficient reason to allow these men and women to be awarded and recognized with either the Purple Heart or, in the case of civilians, the Defense of Freedom medal. It's an appropriate recognition of their service and sacrifice,"" McHugh added.

A new Army review prompted by the new legislation determined there was enough evidence to back up that Hasan ""was in communication with the foreign terrorist organization before the attack,"" and that his radicalization and subsequent acts could reasonably be considered to have been ""inspired or motivated by the foreign terrorist organization,"" McHugh said.

The previous eligibility requirements needed a finding that Hasan had been acting at the direction of a foreign terrorist organization.

Reed Rubinstein, a lawyer who advocated on behalf of the families for years, welcomed the Army announcement, though he called it “long-overdue.”

The change in eligibility would not have occurred “but for multiple congressional investigations, dogged media scrutiny, targeted legislation and a federal court action, and the tenacity and dedication of Rep. John Carter, Rep. Mike McCaul, former Rep. Frank Wolf, and former Sen. Joe Lieberman,"" Rubinstein said.

“But it is the victims themselves who deserve most of the credit,” he added. “Promised by the Commander in Chief that they would be 'made whole' by the government, they refused to let political lies and bureaucratic abuse go unchallenged. They refused to be silent, spoke truth to power and won this important victory.”

The Army will now identify soldiers and civilians eligible for the awards and “contact them about presentation of the awards,” the Army said. Purple Heart recipients automatically qualify for combat-related special compensation upon retirement and are eligible for burial at Arlington National Cemetery.

In August 2013, Hasan was convicted of 13 counts of premeditated murder and 32 counts of attempted murder and sentenced to death. He is incarcerated at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, while his case is under appeal."

KinderCare, which has 1,900 centers nationwide, made the move one day after five infants at a Chicago-area KinderCare were diagnosed with the measles. The first dose of the MMR vaccine, which protects against measles, mumps and rubella, is not administered until a child is a year old, and KinderCare said in a statement that it hopes to protect its children who are too young to be vaccinated by also limiting access to infant rooms.

""While is not a requirement for children who attend our centers to be vaccinated, we highly encourage parents to speak with their family doctor about immunizations for their children, and we work closely with each family to be sure our immunization records are up-to-date,"" the company said in a statement. “However, we understand that some children are unable to be vaccinated – for medical reasons and or for religious reasons – and we do not exclude those children from our centers.”

The current measles outbreak includes at least 102 reported cases in 14 states,"

As of 11 p.m. ET Saturday, airlines had canceled 1,048 flights scheduled for Sunday. Of those, 445 were flights out of Chicago's O'Hare International Airport.

The developing winter storm was moving through the southern and central Plains today, bringing a mixture of snow, sleet, freezing rain, and rain to the region.

Winter storm warnings, watches, and advisories were currently in effect around midday Saturday from the central Plains to New England in anticipation of the winter storm on the way.

The upcoming storm was expected to strengthen Saturday evening with a large area of heavy snow developing across the central Plains, and eventually through the Midwest Saturday night and early Sunday morning.

The heaviest snow is expected to fall generally along and north of Interstate 80, with a wintry mix and rain expected for areas south of there.

On Sunday morning, heavy snow is forecast to be falling from Des Moines, Iowa, to Chicago and as far east as Detroit and Cleveland.

By Sunday evening, the snow will continue to fall from Chicago to Cleveland and begin to move into the Northeast. A wintry mix and areas of heavy rain are expected further south from Indianapolis to the northern Tennessee Valley.

Current snowfall forecasts from the ABC Weather Team call for accumulations of 8-12 inches from central Iowa through the northern Ohio Valley by Monday morning. Isolated amounts over a foot are possible, focusing on areas east of Chicago through northern Ohio.

This storm will continue to track east Sunday night and into Monday morning impacting a large stretch of the I-95 corridor from Washington, D.C to coastal Maine.

From Washington, D.C. to Philadelphia, mixing with rain and sleet will lead to lower snow totals. However from New York City up to Boston, significant amounts of snow with an icy and dangerous Monday morning commute expected."

“I'm not going to be able to save every kid, but I have a responsibility to save kids here as much as I can in this mosque,” Imam Mohamed Magid of the All Dulles Area Muslim Society, or ADAMS, said. “We teach them here in this mosque, being a Muslim it means to believe in all aspects of life of being a good citizen and being a good individual.”

Magid has made efforts to integrate young Muslims into their community at a time where ISIS militants continue to ramp up their recruiting efforts online, he told ABC News chief global affairs correspondent Martha Raddatz in an interview.

“ISIS is very savvy in the Internet,” Magid said. “They see the traffic, who's coming to watch and so forth and during that time that’s where they catch the young person when he shows curiosity.”

U.S. officials estimate more than 20,000 foreign fighters have flocked to Iraq and Syria to fight in radical groups, with more than 150 Americans among them.

“They start offering [recruits] their narrative that ‘the Muslim world is being humiliated and look at all the suffering. Come and we'll give you a sense of purpose, come join us, we'll make you a great hero,’” Magid said. “The nature of a cult is justification.”

While most of his work has centered around preventative measures with youth, from civic engagement at the center to sports clubs, Magid said he recently changed one young man’s mind who had already been contacted by ISIS.

Magid said he is now confident the young man will never join the group.

“He came to realize this is not what the prophet teaches, and now he resents them, he wants them to be defeated,” Magid said. “Now that kind of young person could be the person to deradicalize and change the mind of other young people.”

The biggest obstacle for young Muslims, Magid said, is isolation.

“They isolate the person from his family: ‘Your parents are not good Muslims, don’t listen to them, your local Imam is not a good man,’ and then they become a cult where they are completely isolated from any opportunities, any possibilities to counter the narrative,” Magid said.

It’s one reason he started a workshop for parents centered around promoting Internet safety.

“We need the parents to be savvy and understanding their place in the virtual space,” Magid said. “The best line of defense in this whole issue is parents, family. Complete awareness about your children, for instance, what they're doing, who they are, friends they have in the virtual community, that’s very important.”

Abdullah Baig, who is an 18-year-old member of ADAMS, said young people in the Sterling, Virginia, mosque talk about compassion, loving one another and being kind to one’s parents as being central tenants of Islam."

They had lived face-to-face, heart-to-heart, sharing every breath as conjoined twins since they were born 10 months ago. But to give them both a chance at an independent life, the two infant girls underwent a highly complicated and risky surgery at Texas Children’s Hospital in Houston to be separated.

Each separation surgery is different, and presents its own challenges and potential complications. Texas Children's Hospital officials said they hadn't performed a separation surgery this complicated before. But the twins’ parents, Elysse and Eric Mata, decided they had no other choice than to put their babies through the surgery.

“I want to give them a shot at a normal life as much as possible,” Elysse Mata said. “I feel like they've come this far, why hold back? Why not follow through? Why not give them that chance?”

That Knatalye and Adeline have made it this far is remarkable. Roughly 200,000 conjoined twins are born each year. As many as 60 percent of conjoined twins are stillborn, and about 35 percent only survive one day. Past that, conjoined twins have a 5 to 25 percent chance of survival.

“Nightline” was there as a team of 12 surgeons spent 26 hours performing the separation surgery on Knatalye and Adeline last Tuesday and Wednesday, and also with the Mata family, as they received updates on their daughters’ condition.

Watch the full story, including the twins' surgery, on ""Nightline"" tonight at 12:35 a.m. ET

Elysse and Eric had been waiting for that day since they first found out during an ultrasound they were expecting twins.

“I looked at my husband, he was just like, you know, jaw drop,” Elysse said. “Then, [the doctor] said, ‘But we think they're conjoined.’ And my heart sunk in that moment and I just froze… I was like, ‘this can't be real.’”

The two infant girls were conjoined from the ribcage down to their pelvis, and some of their internal organs, including their liver and lungs, were fused together.

When she found out the twins were conjoined, Elysse, 25, said, doctors talked to her about terminating the pregnancy, but she said that was never an option.

“I told him, ‘I don't care what the case is, I'm going to go as long as I can, and if God decides that he needs them more, then so be it,’” she said.

But there was hope once doctors learned the girls each had their own hearts, beating separately on their own.

On April 11, 2014, the two sisters beat the odds and were born alive, nine weeks premature, at Texas Children’s Hospital. Eric and Elysse decided to give the girls meaningful middle names: Hope and Faith.

“It was heaven on earth, just to be able to hold them so close to me,” Elysse said. “Everybody talks about when they see their baby, they don't count their toes, they just see a baby… I just saw two miracle angels laying there, peacefully sleeping.”

But after they were born, the babies had to stay in the intensive care unit until the surgery, so Eric, 29, Elysse, and their 5-year-old son, Azariah, uprooted their lives in Lubbock, Texas, to live in an RV near the Houston hospital. Eric commuted eight hours each way from Lubbock to see his wife, son and newborn babies.

Over the next few months, the babies thrived in the NICU, but a team of nurses performed everyday tasks, such as bathing and diaper changing.

At 10 months old, doctors determined the girls had a good chance of surviving the separation surgery, so a team, led by Dr. Darrell Cass, began to prepare. They spent months creating 3-D models of the babies’ insides and practiced on mannequins. Despite all the preparation, there was still a chance the girls would die in surgery.

“Separating conjoined twins is a very complicated task and there are lots of risks involved, and death is absolutely one of those risks,” Cass said."

Alleging that middle-class Americans can get ripped off by their financial advisers, the president spoke at AARP's Washington, D.C., headquarters today to make the case for a new proposed rule.

""Because of bad advice, because of skewed incentives, because of a lack of protection, you could end up in a situation where you lose some of your hard-earned money simply because your adviser isn’t required to put your interest first,” Obama said. “The truth is, most people don’t even realize it’s happening.""

The new rule would require that advisers who handle retirement funds like 401(k)s and IRAs act in their clients' best interest, adhering to a new ""fiduciary"" standard that doesn't currently exist.

The idea is that financial advisers get paid extra to recommend certain funds, incentivizing bad advice and costing investors in the long run, according to Obama.

The new rule won't go into effect immediately -- or at all, necessarily. It will be proposed by the Labor Department and will then be subject to public and congressional comment. The Labor Dept. says it will take criticisms into account before making anything final.

So, if a new regulation is adopted, what would will it mean for your retirement account?

Pamela Banks, senior policy counsel at the D.C.-based group Consumers Union, says the rule would help investors.

""These rules would help put consumers first by removing conflicts of interest among brokers and other financial retirement advisers, closing loopholes, and raising accountability for the industry,"" Banks said in a press release.

The effects are being debated by the White House and the financial industry.

The White House says it will mean savings for investors. In a lengthy fact sheet, the White House claimed ""middle-class families who receive conflicted advice"" on average see one percentage point lower returns on their retirement investments, adding up to $17 billion of losses nationwide each year. Over 35 years, a $10,000 retirement investment would grow to $38,000 instead of $27,500. For a worker rolling over a $100,000 401(k) into an IRA at age 45, that investment would grow to $216,000 instead of $179,000.

Those are the White House's projections, but industry tells another story.

The asset-manager trade group Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association points to a private study of a 2010 proposal for a ""fiduciary"" requirement--from which the Labor Dept. says it has deviated this time around--finding that IRA investors could have paid 75 percent to 195 percent more under that 2010 plan.

The group says retirement investors in the U.K. have experienced reduced access to investment guidance, and some with low-balance accounts have been declined as new clients, under a similar rule.

Apart from the arguments on both sides, here's one thing investors should keep in mind: the new rule is expected to affect IRAs more than 401(k)s. That's because 401(k) plans already include an element of ""fiduciary"" responsibility, whereas IRAs do not.

The new rule would mostly effect investors rolling over their retirement accounts ""from a 401(k) where you were advised under a fiduciary standard"" into an IRA, White House Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Jason Furman told ABC News on a conference call with reporters. ""The scope of the problem is focused there."""

At a high school girls' hockey game in Fargo Friday, some spectators noticed the Zamboni driver exhibiting ""erratic behavior"" between the first and second period, according to Jim Larson, the director of finance and human resources for Fargo Parks, which runs the rink.

""Some of the parents noticed the driver appeared to be impaired,"" Larson said.

A school district employee called authorities, Larson said, and the driver, Fargo Parks employee Steven Anderson, was arrested for suspected DUI, the Fargo Police Department said.

No players were on the ice while Anderson was allegedly driving, according to Larson, and no injuries or damages were reported.

""I have been with the district for 22 years and this is the first time we've experienced this,"" Larson said.

Anderson has since been released on bail, police said.

Anderson has ""worked for us on and off seasonally for six years,"" Larson said. He added that Anderson ""is removed totally from work at this time. We will formally address the personnel issue on Monday.""

""Safety is critical,"" Larson said. ""We consider this to be a very serious incident. On Monday we will take a full review to see how this happened and what we can do to keep it from ever occurring again.""

Anderson could face up to 30 days in jail along with a fine of up to $1,000, Fargo police told ABC News."

Authorities believe the man is Otis Byrd, 54, a convicted murderer out of prison on parole, but an autopsy is being performed to confirm the identity and cause of death.

""We got a young man that died and we're going to determine how he died and if someone did that, that person will be brought to justice and he will be punished for that,"" said Claiborne County Sheriff Marvin Lucas.

Byrd was last seen March 2 and, within days, his family filed a missing person report with the Claiborne County Sheriff’s Office. The FBI and Mississippi Bureau of Investigation were then asked to help, the FBI said in a statement. The man's body was found about a half-mile from Byrd's home.

As a precaution, the FBI has opened a preliminary civil rights investigation, focusing on whether Byrd's race may have played a role in his death. Lucas said his family was unaware of any threats made against him.

Earlier Thursday, the Claiborne County Sheriff's Office and the Mississippi Wildlife Fisheries and Parks conducted a ground search for Byrd."

Jenner was a driver in one of the cars, the Sheriff's Department said. His rep told ABC News that Jenner is fine.

Jenner cooperated with investigators, police said. He passed a field sobriety test and then voluntarily submitted a blood sample to determine whether he was intoxicated.

""He did not appear intoxicated or under the influence of anything at the time,"" Sheriff's Sgt. Philip Brooks said.

""It appears Bruce Jenner was involved in the rear-end of a vehicle, however he was the third car in a multiple rear-end collision,"" Brooks said.

Five people were hospitalized with minor injuries, according to the Sheriff's Department.

The crash took place just after noon on the Pacific Coast Highway at Corral Canyon Road, the Sheriff's Department said. The cause is under investigation.

Photos of the crash site showed a white Lexus that was severely damaged in both the front and the back. There was also a black Hummer that had its hood open and its engine damaged. A black Escalade that was pulling an off-road vehicle had a damaged front end, and a black Prius appeared to have been rear-ended, The Associated Press reported.

Jenner rose to fame in the '70s when he won the gold medal in the decathlon at the Montreal Olympics.

The former Olympian has remained in the spotlight on the reality show ""Keeping Up With the Kardashians,"" which for the past eight years has documented Jenner raising daughters Kendall and Kylie with now ex-wife Kris Jenner.

Jenner is also father to four other children -- Brody, Burt, Brandon and Casey -- and step-father to Kris Jenner's children Kourtney, Kim, Khloé and Rob Kardashian."
1LzYaed,2015-02-24 00:00:00,Trayvon Martin: DOJ Announces No Charges Against George Zimmerman - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/US/trayvon-martin-doj-announces-charges-george-zimmerman/story?id=29186648,"While the public waits for a Justice Department announcement over two separate investigations spurred by the summer shooting of an unarmed teenager in Ferguson, Missouri, the department announced today it is closing its investigation into the killing of Trayvon Martin.

Justice Department officials met with Martin's family today, and were told that they will not be filing charges against George Zimmerman, who shot the 17-year-old after a confrontation in 2012. Thursday marks three years to the day since Martin was killed.

Federal prosecutors concluded there is not sufficient evidence to prove Zimmerman, a neighborhood watchman in Sanford, Fla., intentionally violated Martin's civil rights.

""Although the department has determined that this matter cannot be prosecuted federally, it is important to remember that this incident resulted in the tragic loss of a teenager's life,"" Acting Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta of the Civil Rights Division said. ""Our decision not to pursue federal charges does not condone the shooting that resulted in the death of Trayvon Martin and is based solely on the high legal standard applicable to these cases.""
The case sparked intense discussions over race in America because Martin was walking to his home with only Skittles and an iced tea in his hands.

Florida prosecutors tried to convict Zimmerman of state-level murder and manslaughter charges, but in July 2013 a jury acquitted him, saying prosecutors didn't have enough evidence to prove their case.

One juror -– the only minority on the all-female jury –- later told ABC News that ""as the law was read to me, if you have no proof that he killed him intentionally, you can't say he's guilty.""

""You can't put the man in jail even though in our hearts we felt he was guilty,"" she said. ""But we had to grab our hearts and put it aside and look at the evidence.""

In Sanford, race-related tensions had been simmering for nearly a century, but Martin's death ""was the proverbial 'straw that broke the camel's back,'"" bringing ""those issues to the surface,"" the new Sanford police chief, Cecil Smith, recently told federal officials.

After Martin was killed, Holder sat down his own teenage son to explain that -- as unfair as it may be -- young black men must often interact with police in a different way than others, he told a convention in April 2014. It was ""a conversation I hoped I'd never have to have,"" Holder added.

As media attention mounted over Martin's death, protests grew across the country calling for justice. The city of Sanford now says a police department had not been scrutinized like that by the press, religious organizations, social activists and the broader public since Los Angeles police beat Rodney King in 1991.

Zimmerman was not a police officer and the neighborhood watch program he was a part of was independent from local police.

Many accused Zimmerman of discriminating against Martin –- essentially taking action against the teenager and ultimately killing him because Martin was black. Zimmerman is Hispanic.

The Justice Department's Civil Rights Division and FBI opened an investigation into the case, noting ""experienced federal prosecutors"" would determine ""whether the evidence reveals a prosecutable violation"" of federal law. In a statement, the department noted there are ""limited federal criminal civil rights statutes within our jurisdiction.""

Privately and publicly, Justice Department officials have been telegraphing all along that they were unlikely to file charges against Zimmerman. And in November 2013, Holder said the case against Zimmerman ""in substantial part was resolved"" with his acquittal months earlier.

Nevertheless, federal officials have insisted their civil-rights probe would be thorough and complete. Several months ago –- nearly two years into the Justice Department's investigation –- Holder said federal investigators were still seeking to interview certain witnesses ""as a result of some recent developments.""

More recently, Holder has said he hoped to announce the findings of the Zimmerman and Ferguson-related probes before he leaves office, which could happen in a matter of weeks, depending on when the U.S. Senate confirms his successor.

Holder has said then when a decision is announced in the Zimmerman case, it will be accompanied by ""as much information"" as possible detailing the Justice Department's findings.

In the Ferguson case, the department is currently conducting two probes into the matter.

A criminal investigation will try to determine whether then-officer Darren Wilson used unreasonable force and intentionally violated Michael Brown's civil rights when he shot the unarmed teenager in August. The second probe - though not criminal in nature –- will look more broadly into whether the Ferguson police department has routinely engaged in a ""pattern or practice"" of unlawful and discriminatory policing.

A state grand jury in Ferguson, Missouri, declined to indict Wilson in Novembe4 2014. Many expect the Justice Department will not be able to bring federal charges against Wilson, but will take action against the local police department.

""The president has been clear that now is not the time for Congress to pass additional legislation on Iran,"" National Security Council spokeswoman Bernadette Meehan told ABC News. ""If this bill is sent to the president, he will veto it.""

Along with Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker, R-Tenn., introduced a bill this week that would allow Congress 60 days to review, and potentially reject, any deal to roll back U.S. nuclear sanctions on Iran.

In a statement issued by his office, Corker called the White House's veto threat ""disappointing.""

The framework for the current negotiations calls for an ultimate deal to ""lift"" nuclear sanctions on Iran, and some observers have concluded that would necessitate an eventual vote from Congress anyway, even if sanctions are only gradually eased in the nearer term.

Negotiations between Iran and world powers including the U.S., UK, France, Germany, Russia, and China have entered their final phase ahead of a March 31 deadline.

Secretary of State John Kerry told The Associated Press the sides had made ""some progress"" after his last meeting with Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif this week."

Andreas Lubitz, 27, was a German citizen and started working for Germanwings' parent company Lufthansa at a flight training center outside of Phoenix in 2008, company officials said.

The facility, called Airline Training Center Arizona, was owned by Lufthansa and is used by its pilots in addition to other training locations in Germany, Switzerland and Austria, officials said.

A spokeswoman for Germanwings told ABC News that he also received some of his training in Bremen, Germany.

In spite of undergoing some of his training in 2008, he reportedly took breaks during the process and only became an official Germanwings pilot in 2013.

""Six years ago there had been an interruption to his training,"" Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr said at a news conference today. ""We checked his skills and his competence and then he went back to training school. After that he was successful.""

He went on to explain that the interruption lasted for a few months but he did not elaborate on the reason and said it was something that could happen regularly in their program.

Spohr said Lubitz passed training school ""with flying colors.""

""He was fit in all areas, 100 percent,"" Spohr said.

Lubitz belonged to a flying club in his hometown, and fellow member Peter Ruecker told the Associated Press that Lubitz had spoken about his time in Arizona.

""He seemed very happy that he got the job, beforehand he had training in the United States for three years, and we met him here again when he returned to renew his license and we talked for some time,"" Ruecker told the Associated Press. ""He told us about how it was in America, how he did his training there, and he seemed to be very open and happy that he made it that far.""

He had 630 hours of flying experience by the time he was at the controls during Tuesday's fatal crash into the French Alps, only 100 hours of which were on the same model plane, the Airbus A320, officials said.

U.S. law enforcement officials have offered cooperation on the investigation.

""The FBI has offered assistance to our French partners, who are leading the investigation into the crash of Germanwings Flight 9525,"" the agency said in a statement today. ""We stand ready to fulfill any requests for information or assistance by crash investigators, as we work with partner nations whose citizens were impacted by this tragedy.""

Editor’s note: A French prosecutor initially said Lubitz was 28 years old but a law enforcement official later determined that he was 27.

The outbreak is believed to have begun with a group of unvaccinated people visiting Disneyland in California in December, but it has now spread to 17 states -- the latest being Delaware, Michigan and Nevada -- according to the CDC. Last week, five babies at an Illinois daycare center were diagnosed with measles, prompting national daycare center chain KinderCare to require all staff members working with newborns to be vaccinated.

Of the first 34 people with measles for whom the California Department of Public Health had vaccination records, only five had received both doses of the measles vaccine, according to the agency. One received just the first dose. Nationally, officials are seeing the same trend, said Dr. Anne Schuchat, who directs the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said during a news conference Thursday. Some of those 34 cases tracked by California may not be included in the 121 tally by the CDC because they were reported before Jan. 1.

The CDC is seeing more adult cases of measles than usual during this outbreak, Schuchat said, adding that children are getting the virus, too.

Cases have now been reported in Arizona, California, Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota, Michigan, Nebraska, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Texas, Utah and Washington, according to the CDC. The agency issued a health advisory on Jan. 23, at which point the virus had only spread to six states beyond California and Mexico.

The United States last year reported its highest number of measles cases in two decades, with 644 cases as part of 20 separate outbreaks. Health officials attribute the spike to a measles outbreak in the Philippines and overseas travelers.

The 121 cases in the U.S. reported since Jan. 1 of this year are considered part of one outbreak.

The measles virus is contagious long before symptoms appear, and it is airborne, according to the CDC. One infected person with the measles can spread it to an average of 18 other people, and it can linger in the air and live on surfaces to spread after an infected person has left a room.

Complications include hearing loss, pneumonia and swelling of the brain, according to the CDC. About one or two people out of every 1,000 people infected with the measles die of the virus."

“In the wake of a cease-fire agreement that appears only to have consolidated Russian and separatist gains since the first Minsk agreement, we urge you to quickly approve additional efforts to support Ukraine’s efforts to defend its sovereign territory, including through the transfer of lethal, defensive weapons systems to the Ukrainian military,” a letter sent by the group of lawmakers today reads.

President Obama signed the Ukraine Freedom Support Act on Dec. 18, but noted in a statement that day that “the administration does not intend to impose sanctions under this law, but the act gives the administration additional authorities that could be utilized, if circumstances warranted.”

Now, Congress wants Obama to reconsider after his administration has been hesitant to provide military aid.

“Congress has already, with overwhelming bipartisan support, provided you with the authorities, resources, and political support to provide assistance, including lethal, to the government and people of Ukraine,” notes the letter, signed by eight Republicans and three Democrats. “We urge you in the strongest possible terms to use those authorities and resources to meet the specific and direct requests the government of Ukraine has made of your administration.”

Last week, Boehner and a bipartisan group of lawmakers met at the Capitol with Ukrainian lawmakers, including Andriy Parubiy, first vice-speaker of the Verkohona Rada, also known as the Supreme Council of Ukraine. The speaker's office said the group ""had a productive discussion about their shared goals of peace, freedom, and security."" The letter today is the first visible effort to follow up on that meeting.

Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko addressed a joint meeting of the United States Congress last September, urging lawmakers to stand with Ukraine.

The letter is signed by Boehner, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-California, House Appropriations Committee Chairman Hal Rogers, R-Kentucky, House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mac Thornberry, R-Texas, Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce, R-California, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, R-California, Defense Appropriations Subcommittee Chairman Rodney Frelinghuysen, R-New Jersey, State and Foreign Operations Appropriations Subcommittee Chairwoman Kay Granger, R-Texas, Rep.

Ford, 72, was forced to make an emergency landing at Penmar Golf Course, just west of Santa Monica Municipal Airport, at 2:20 p.m. PST Thursday after the engine of the Ryan ST3KR plane he was flying failed, said NTSB and Los Angeles fire officials. He was taken to a nearby hospital in ""fair to moderate"" condition, said Patrick Butler with the Los Angeles Fire Department.

Ford reported engine trouble shortly after taking off from Santa Monica Municipal Airport and asked for an immediate return to the airport, said NTSB investigator Patrick Jones. He then reported that his aircraft came up short of the runway, according to air traffic controller transmissions from LiveATC.net.

The vintage airplane that Ford was piloting clipped a tree before crashing, said Jones.

Elaine Miller told ABC station KABC that the pilot was able to speak and ""expressed that he was in pain."" She and several others helped him out of the plane after it crashed.

""He had a significant head wound,"" said Miller. ""He asked someone to hold his legs up, and people were just saying, 'you’re okay, the fire department is on its way,' and...once police and fire started to arrive, my friends and I sort of backed away and went to the other side of the course to give them room.""

Carlos Gomez, who lives across the street from the golf course, described the plane crash as sounding like a boom.

""I hear a lot of ambulances and I come outside and see people from the golf course pull a man from the plane,"" he said. ""He was moving his arms and legs. I was happy he was alive and not paralyzed.""

Mark Hamill, who is appearing alongside Ford in ""Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,"" poked fun at his co-star's plane crash.

Glad to hear Harrison is doing well. Get well soon. May all his future flights be green-screen!

Ford's son tweeted that his father was ""battered, but ok!""

At the hospital. Dad is ok. Battered, but ok! He is every bit the man you would think he is. He is an incredibly strong man.

Thank you all for your thoughts and good vibes for my dad.

The NTSB will recover the airplane Friday, said Jones.

An avid pilot, Ford told ABC's Barbara Walters in 2008 that he ""loved the freedom of flight.""

""I love the places you go,"" he said. ""I love the people in aviation, the people that I meet in aviation. I love seeing the world from an airplane. I'm in love with flying.""

Ford survived a crash once before. He and a flight instructor crashed a helicopter near Van Nuys Airport in California in 1999, according to The Los Angeles Times.

Ford has worked to support general aviation with the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, and he presented a legacy award in his name to the president of the association in January.

Ford broke his leg on the set of ""Star Wars: Episode VII"" in June 2014 after a door crashed down on it. He had successful surgery following the incident.

Star Wars is produced by Lucasfilm, which is owned by The Walt Disney Co., which also owns ABC News.

Bill Richard was talking about his son, Martin, who died when one of the two bombs detonated near the finish line of the Boston Marathon April 15, 2013. Two other people, 29-year-old Krystle Campbell and 23-year-old Lingzi Lu, were also killed, and another 260 were injured in the attack.

Bill Richard addressed the court in a clear, calm voice, describing the day that he and his family went to watch the runners. First, they ducked in to a Ben and Jerry’s for ice cream – Bill still remembers the flavor of ice cream that Martin got – and then found a spot to watch the runners near the finish line.

There is a photograph showing the Richard family as they watch the race. Martin had climbed on the metal crowd barrier a bit to get a better look. His family didn’t know that just then, seen in the same photograph just an arm’s length away, was then 19-year-old Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, allegedly dropping a backpack with a bomb inside.

When the bomb went off a few minutes later, Bill Richard’s daughter Jane lost her leg and Martin was killed.

“I saw a little boy who had his body severely damaged by an explosion,” Bill Richard told the jury flatly. “I just knew from what I saw that there was no chance.”

At the very end of his testimony, the last for the week, prosecutors asked Richard how old his boy was when he was killed.

“He was eight years old,” Richard said.

Tsarnaev’s defense said in opening statements they’re not going to contest the fact that their client, along with his late older brother Tamerlan, was responsible for detonating the two bombs that day.

Legal experts told ABC News the defense is likely focusing only on trying to avoid the death penalty for Tsarnaev in the penalty phase of the case."

Israeli police say the driver got out of the vehicle wielding a knife and attempted to stab passersby before he was shot by police. Israeli Police spokeswoman Luba Samri described the assault as a ""terror attack” and says four of those injured in the attack were police officers.

Israeli Superintendent Micky Rosenfeld tweeted about the incident as it unfolded:

Police units respond to vehicle that ran over 4 people in Jerusalem. Suspect held by police. Investigation into attack under way

The wounded were hospitalized at the city’s Hadassah Har Hatzofim hospital, two with moderate injuries, and the others with minor injuries.

Helicopters hovered over the neighborhood, and video purporting to capture the scene of the attack shows heavy police presence, sirens wailing.

A Jerusalem Post photographer was on hand.

Police are still trying to identify the attacker. The car he was driving was registered to a Palestinian from east Jerusalem, The Associated Press reported.

Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri was quick to praise the ""heroic"" attack, according to reports, but did not claim responsibility. Today’s attack occurred at the same place where a similar attack killed one police officer and injured more than a dozen back in December. Jerusalem mayor Nir Barkat vowed to ""keep fighting terrorism,” noting that the the city's Purim celebrations would be held as scheduled later today.

That's the question many had when a photo of #TheDress ""broke the Internet"" last week, dividing the majority of users into those who saw white and gold and those who saw black and blue.

But today, the Salvation Army in South Africa is using the question on a new photo Twitter PSA fighting against domestic violence and abuse against women.

The PSA shows a model wearing a gold-and-white edited version of #TheDress. More controversial than #TheDress, though, are the black and blue bruises and cuts covering her body.

Is it so hard 2 see black & blue? 1 in 6 women are victims.
#StopAbuseAgainstWomen
#blackandblue #whiteandgold pic.twitter.com/HoYNXBQRIE

The ad then challenges victim-blaming, saying, ""The only illusion is if you think it was her choice.""

""One in six women are victims of abuse,"" the text continues. ""Stop abuse against women.""

The powerful ad was produced by South African creative agency Ireland/Davenport as a charity piece for the Salvation Army just Thursday.

""We wanted to take advantage of the hype of the meme to spread awareness for something important,"" Ireland/Davenport creative director Wihan Meerhloz told ABC News today. ""Our creative team brainstormed ways to send a greater message about overlooked abuse against women using the dress.""

Meerhloz said he credits team members Caitlyn Goldring and Werner Cloete as the people behind the project literally done in less than a day.

""We thought of the idea, produced it and offered it completely free to the Salvation Army in less than 24 hours,"" he said. ""We hope it takes off on the Internet like the original dress did.""

The PSA had over 1,200 retweets as of this morning, with dozens of positive feedback from Twitter users.

@SalvationArmySA Brilliant campaign. Let's hope it helps stop abuse blindness

@SalvationArmySA @garyadcock Wow. Turned that one around. Powerful re-use of social media.

""Everybody on the Internet, thank you for retweeting, resending and sharing this strong message,"" Meerhloz said. ""Let's keep on going!""

The Salvation Army in South Africa and #TheDress retailer Roman did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for additional comment."

Attorney Robert Harris said his client, John Marshall, 52, had missing teeth and appeared to have some broken fingers. Marshall said he had gotten into a fight with a neighbor, identified as Theodore Hubbell Jr., 65.

Marshall then told Harris the body was in the back of the pickup truck, the lawyer said. “Once I learned of the facts, I called 911,” Harris told ABC affiliate WZVN-TV in Fort Myers.

The Lee County Sheriff’s Office confirmed it is investigating Hubbell’s death. At this point, no charges have been filed.

Harris called the situation “a clear-cut case of self-defense.”

Marshall lives in Cape Coral, near Fort Myers, and had purchased property off a dirt road in a rural neighborhood called Bokeelia, Harris said.

Marshall and his wife planned to build a house and had built a shed on the property, and they kept a camper there, Harris said. The neighbor didn't want Marshall to build in the rural area, Harris said.

A few days before the incident, Marshall and the neighbor argued, Harris said. Marshall called Harris, who advised his client to get a restraining order.

Harris said Marshall called police and reported the incident, but a restraining order had not been issued.

The situation turned physical Wednesday, and Marshall was pistol-whipped during the fight, Harris said. “He's distraught. He's a man who fought for his life, but it doesn't change the fact that someone is dead,” Harris said.

Neighbors are devastated by Hubbell’s death, and wonder why Marshall would drive with the body in his truck.

“If I, in self-defense, had to shoot somebody or kill somebody in my home or near my home, what would I do – drag the body into my vehicle and take it to my lawyer?” neighbor Jill Hammer told WZVN. “I would be calling 911. That’s what you do. Any sane person would.”

As he grew, the toddler's mother Lindsey said he loved building with blocks, going for walks and feeding deer at the park.

""Zach was mischievous, cheeky, and extremely brilliant,"" she said. ""He would walk and hold onto our hands, or the couches. He was a normal developing child up until last year. Then, over a couple of days he just stopped walking.""

Parnaby, 29, and her husband Ben, 29, immediately grew concerned.

At first, Zach's regression was thought to be a phase and doctors were confident that it would subside. But by early December, the now 20-month-old's motor skills had begun to shut down.

""He [Zach] started sitting in a different position and by the end, he was sitting and falling back."" Parnaby told ABC News. ""He started losing all ability to do things, so we insisted on not leaving the hospital.""

On Dec. 17, Zach's doctors were confident that he had some form of cerebral palsy.

""They said it was one of two forms, both were terminal,"" Parnaby said. ""They couldn't tell us which one it was until they did more tests. I didn't want to believe it.

""By this time he wasn't even able to sit up. He was quite disabled.""

The hospital would not comment on the case when reached by ABC News, saying that privacy laws prohibit them from releasing patient information.

On Christmas Eve, the Parnabys' said their worst fears were confirmed. Zach was diagnosed with Krabbe leukodystrophy, a rare genetic disorder that affects the nervous system.

Doctors told the couple that their son would have just two years left to live.

""I think we were numb, to be honest,"" Parnaby recalled. ""You hear of children being diagnosed, but you never expect it to happen to your own.""

With the heartbreaking revelation of Zach's life being cut so short, his mom and dad decided that they were going to make every single day count.

About one month after his diagnosis, the Parnabys created a bucket list for their son.

""We couldn't sit home and feel sorry for ourselves and be morbid every day because in turn, it would make Zach feel that way,"" Parnaby said. ""We took the stance that if Zach is smiling every day, then that's what matters.

Many of the 16 items on the list are things that Parnaby said, her and her husband would've wanted to do over the course of Zach's life like riding a bike, meeting Santa, seeing a waterfall and more.

Six of the wishes have already been completed including owning his own dog, and getting to meet a famous person.

""He got to meet the Newcastle United team,"" Parnaby said. ""His dad would’ve taken Zach to many matches as he grew up.""

To aid in Zach's medical care and to help fulfill his bucket list wishes, Zach's family has created a GoFundMe page titled ""A Promise For Zach.""

In the future, Parnaby said she'd like to use any remaining donations to help families with terminally ill children.

""When we experienced that diagnosis, we were sent away with some facts and medication,"" she said. ""I had to go out and find support. We want to help families and help them over the crisis, to fill that gap and be there for them.

""Prior to the onset of this disease Zach very rarely cried and he was just genuinely happy; very happy. It's keeping us focused and when we're out there and doing things he's much more relaxed.

""Other families can do what we're doing and make that child's life as happy as they can in the short time they have.""

The birds were seen on a webcam at Codorus State Park set up by the Pennsylvania Game Commission.

As snow piled up on the birds’ nest, one of the eagles placed its body over the eggs.

Naturalist Jack Hubley told LancasterOnline.com that the layers of the bird’s feathers help to provide insulation to the bird and eggs tucked underneath.

The Pennsylvania Game Commission tweeted on Thursday that the eagles stay warm through winter by eating and fluffing their feathers for insulation.

Their eggs are kept warm underneath a “brooding patch.”

As spring continues to draw closer, eyes will once again be trained on the webcam as those eggs get ready to hatch."

Don't remember who that is? Let us help you with a list of seven things to do when you're unplugged.

The National Day of Unplugging starts tonight at sundown, until sundown Saturday, encouraging a lifestyle change to let go of your cellphone or iPad once in a while.

So head to your local museum or gallery to appreciate beauty in-person. Just don't double-tap the paintings to ""heart"" them.

2. Write a birthday card instead of a wall post

To go beyond friendships that have an ""unattached cohesion that Facebook created,"" how about pre-writing a couple birthday cards for the special people in your life? You probably forgot their birthdays, so you can log in to Facebook after Saturday sundown to confirm their date of birth.

3. Ask, don't text, someone out

Comedian Aziz Ansari was right: Texting has ruined dating. Trying to get to know people as a single person is now centered on making or failing to make plans via texting.

""It's like you're a secretary for this really shoddy organization scheduling the dumbest sh** with the flakiest people ever,"" he told Conan O'Brien in 2013.

If the person you ask out doesn't like you, just swipe them away.

4. Make plans ahead of time

Even in the non-dating world, cellphones allow people to make flexible plans, with wiggle room to change a meeting place or time in a pinch. Take a time capsule back to 1980 when people stick to their plans.

By the way, this project was launched in March 2010 by Reboot, a New York-based nonprofit that ""seeks to reinvent Jewish traditions and rituals."" The day started with ""recognition that everyone can benefit from reclaiming a day of rest,"" according to Tanya Schevitz, Reboot's national communications manager based in San Francisco.

5. Read a map, not an app

Google Maps and HopStop help people find their way but many of us have lost the ability to read a map. We would be lost if there were an apocalypse and we needed to rely on our parchment map to trek to the food-foraging forest from the weapons station.

6. Read something on paper

Reading is fun! Newspapers, paperback and hardcover books, glossy magazines say they miss us a lot. Remember to recycle them after use.

7. Play a party game

""Words with Friends"" and ""Candy Crush"" can wait. How about going old school with Scrabble and Candyland?"

Authorities are investigating the death of Ahmed Al-Jumaili, 36, who was killed in the parking lot of an apartment complex late Wednesday night.

Al-Jumaili only moved to America three weeks ago, according to a fundraising page set up by friends.

The Dallas Police Department said that the shooting took place at 11:40 p.m., when Al-Jumaili and his wife were taking photos of the snow. He was transported to a nearby hospital, where he died.

According to ABC affiliate WFAA, witnesses told police that a group of men randomly started firing a gun and some nearby cars were also hit.

Crimestoppers offered $5,000 for information that leads to an arrest.

The fundraising appeal tells the love story of Al-Jumaili and his wife, Zahara, who got married 16 months ago. At the time, they lived in Iraq -- but Zahara made the “painful” decision to move to America and live with her relatives in “what she believed to be a safer place,” the site said.

Less than a month ago, the site added, Al-Jumaili, who stayed in Iraq “to continue working and save finances” reunited with his wife in Dallas.

“It is heartbreaking to know that Zahara won't get to experience life's milestones with her Ahmed. Hard to believe that their time together, as husband and wife, started just 16 months ago, and has now tragically ended so suddenly,” the fundraising site said."

The former GOP presidential nominee is set to box former heavyweight champion Evander Holyfield.

Yes, you read that right. The bout is scheduled for May and the two will get in the ring to raise money for charity, an aide to Romney confirms to ABC News.

The Salt Lake City Tribune first reported the news of the fight and in an interview, Romney told them: ""It will either be a very short fight, or I will be knocked unconscious.""

""It won't be much of a fight. We'll both suit up and get in the ring and spar around a little bit,"" Romney said.

The match, scheduled for May 15, is part of a several-bout evening in Salt Lake City to raise money for Charity Vision, a group the Romney family has been active with. They traveled with the group last year to Peru and the 68-year-old former Massachusetts governor just returned from a trip to India with the group.

The charity donates medical equipment to doctors and facilities in poverty stricken areas around the world to aid with the eye surgeries.

One of Romney's sons, Josh, described the evening to the Tribune as a ""black-tie event"" and said the fundraiser will be ""patterned after a 1920s-style event.""

""We just thought it would be a lot better to provide this kind of entertainment rather than just have dinner and listen to speakers,"" the elder Romney said."

The 71-year-old real estate heir, who was shackled in a yellow prison jumpsuit and appeared to be falling asleep when reporters entered court this morning, was arrested in a New Orleans hotel on charges of murdering his friend Susan Berman in Los Angeles in 2000.

He was also subsequently charged with weapons and drug possession when the FBI agents searched him and found he had a gun and marijuana at the time of his March 14 arrest.

Today's court appearance in New Orleans was slated as a preliminary hearing relating on whether or not Durst should be tried in Louisiana for the gun and drugs charges or if he will be extradited to California to face the murder charge.

Durst's defense team, who have repeatedly proclaimed that he is innocent of Berman's murder (though they have not yet had to enter a formal plea), had subpoenaed the FBI agents and state trooper related to his arrest, along with a former New York district attorney who had been involved with the investigation into his first wife's disappearance.

But none of those witnesses showed up -- leading state prosecutors to shout at Durst's defense attorney Dick DeGuerin.

That's when the judge decided to call for a postponement, pushing the hearing back to next Thursday, at which time the FBI agents and others subpoenaed could face contempt of court charges.

The defense team is pushing to have the gun charges thrown out because they believe that it was found as a result of an illegal search that they say took place before the FBI agents had formally received the necessary search warrant.

DeGuerin today accused the prosecutors of ""playing hide the ball,"" though the prosecutor said in court that the allegation was ""unconscionable.""

Durst's actions first came under public scrutiny when his first wife Kathie disappeared from their country home in upstate New York in 1982. His friend, Berman, was then found shot dead in her Los Angeles home in 2000 and the by the next year, he had moved to Galveston, Tex. and killed his neighbor Morris Black. Durst was arrested for Black's murder but was acquitted, saying that he killed Black in self defense, going on to tell the court how he dismembered Black's body and dumped the bagged parts in Galveston Bay.

On Wednesday, Durst's lawyers filed a request to have a subpoena filed against Jeanine Pirro, the Westchester district attorney involved in the investigation of Kathie Durst.

The various sagas involving Durst gained recent public attention when an HBO series called 'The Jinx' featuring interviews with him brought further public scrutiny to the unsolved disappearance of Kathie Durst and unsolved murder of Susan Berman.

In the documentary, it was stated that Pirro and her team had scheduled an interview with Berman shortly before she was killed, but now the motion submitted by Durst's defense team states that he ""seeks to confirm"" that Pirro ""never requested an interview, or otherwise contacted Susan Berman, prior to Susan Berman's death.""

""I want to hear what Pete has to say, and I'll make a decision once I've done that.""

Rose's previous efforts to gain leniency from commissioners Fay Vincent and Bud Selig were never considered.

Rose, 73, played from 1963 to 1986, amassing 4,256 hits, still a major league record. Three years after he retired, Rose agreed to a permanent ban from baseball amid accusations he gambled on games while playing and managing for the Cincinnati Reds.

Gaining reinstatement from the commissioner could be the first step to Rose reaching the Hall of Fame. In 1991, the Hall voted to ban players on the permanently ineligible list from induction.

Manfred, who is a member of the Hall of Fame board, said he has had no discussions with the museum about its plans regarding Rose.

""Honestly, I don't think people should read any disposition into what I'm saying about this. I see it as a really simple thing. He's made a request,"" Manfred said. ""Part of my obligations under the major league constitution is to deal with those requests, and I'll deal with it.""

Manfred took over from Selig in January after serving under him as MLB's chief operating officer and longtime negotiator in collective bargaining. Selig was a staunch opponent of allowing Rose back into the game.

Manfred, who has been making the rounds of major league spring training camps in Florida and Arizona, said the subject of Rose's standing has been among the more frequent questions he has fielded from players. Manfred addressed the Dodgers players and coaches briefly Monday morning.

Dodgers manager Don Mattingly said he thinks there will come a time ""when we all kind of move on."" Mattingly said he first met Rose in a spring training game when Rose was playing for the Montreal Expos.

""I got a hit off somebody, and he said, '200 a year, kid. Just get 200 a year.' Any time I see him, I love seeing him,"" Mattingly said. ""Obviously, as a kid, I loved Pete and the way he played. I'm not going to get into all the politics and everything that goes along with that, but I love Pete and I think Pete's a great player."""

But the ""camouflage was ineffective,"" the spokesman said.

The suspect, Jose Espinoza, 23, was arrested on Saturday night facing charges of possession of stolen property and theft of a vehicle, the spokesman said.

Espinoza fled the first time police arrived at his house, but he was successfully apprehended when he later returned to his home and was allegedly seen with black spray paint on his face, the spokesman said.

The spray paint bottle Espinoza allegedly used has been turned over as evidence, he added.

Espinoza was booked into Madera County Jail early Sunday, according to the jail's records.

A court date during when Espinoza will be expected to answer to his charges is unknown, and it is unclear whether Espinoza has a lawyer."

Police arrested the shooting suspect, David Jamichael Daniels, 22, of Mobile, Alabama, and charged him with seven counts of attempted murder. The Bay County Sheriff's Office said witnesses helped identify him.

Three people were in critical condition following the shooting, the sheriff's office said. Three others were in stable condition and one victim was in surgery, officials said.

Among the victims were three students from Alabama A&M University visiting Panama City Beach for spring break, the sheriff's office said.

The university identified the three as Kearria Freed, 20, who was in critical condition; Kelli Regina Curry, 20, who was in stable condition; and, Annesia Powell, 19, who was undergoing surgery.

The university said it was told the three students were ""innocent victims in the wrong place"" by a Bay County investigator.

Bay County Sheriff Frank McKeithen said in a news conference Saturday afternoon that he wasn't surprised by the shooting.

""We have drunk people under the influence with guns and no respect for themselves, others, and - most of all - authority,"" he said. ""We have a recipe for disaster.""

City officials told ABC that witness accounts said the two missing people were in close proximity to each other just before the blast, so they were anticipating that both would be found near each other in the rubble.

One of the bodies was identified as Nicholas Figueroa, 23, of New York City.

The explosion, which happened Thursday afternoon, left 22 people injured and two missing, city officials have said.

Some containers of debris from the site have been taken to a ""secure"" undisclosed location for additional examination if necessary -- either to look for more evidence or remains, a city official directly involved in the operation said today.

A total of 750 cubic yards of debris has been sifted twice on-site at this point, and put into containers and removed, the official said.

Operations are continuing at the site in the East Village section of the city, the official said.

Cleanup of the site was scheduled to take up to a week, but looks like it could be done by Tuesday, given the current weather and pace of operations, the official said.

Searchers have encountered sections of debris that are still smoldering -- ""hot spots"" -- and they've had to be extinguished, according to the official.

They are hoping to get at least partial access to the restaurant area of the building today, although the above-ground pile of debris will not be cleared today, the official said."

Near Abu Ghraib in Anbar Province, Iraqi forces patrolled in American-made Humvees and fired howitzers at ISIS targets. But just past Iraqi defense embankments, an ISIS-held factory and vast ISIS territory were visible to the naked eye -- a testament to how close the battle is being waged."

Tairod Nathan Webster Pugh, 47, who is from New Jersey but had been living overseas for years, was secretly arrested two months ago after being deported back to the United States.

On Jan. 10, he flew from Egypt to Turkey hoping to slip into Syria and ""fight violent jihad"" with ISIS, but Turkish authorities refused to let him enter their country, federal prosecutors say in court documents filed in Brooklyn, N.Y., authorities said.

Egyptian authorities then deported Pugh to the United States, where he was arrested by the FBI and found to be carrying multiple electronic devices, including a cell phone that allegedly contained a photograph of a machine gun. Some of the data on the electronic devices had been deleted, prosecutors say.

On his laptop, FBI agents discovered that he had been viewing ISIS propaganda online and conducting online searches for such phrases as ""borders controlled by Islamic state,"" ""kobani border crossing,"" and ""who controls kobani,"" according to prosecutors.

In addition, the FBI recovered two of Pugh's backpacks, which allegedly contained two compasses, a solar-powered flashlight, a solar-powered power source, a fatigue jacket and camping clothes.

Pugh also allegedly searched online for the ISIS video ""Flames of War,"" a 55-minute piece of propaganda that even the FBI highlighted late last year when asking ""for the public's help identifying individuals who have traveled—or are planning to travel—overseas to engage in combat alongside terrorist organizations.""

A month before his alleged attempt to join ISIS, Pugh was fired from his job as an airplane mechanic in Kuwait, according to court documents. He learned how to install and maintain aircraft engines, navigation systems and weapons systems while serving in the Air Force from 1986 to 1990, the documents say.

According to court documents, he ""appears to have close ties to a woman in Egypt whom he has identified as his wife.""

A federal grand jury in Brooklyn, N.Y. indicted Pugh Monday on two charges -- attempting to provide material support to terror organization, and obstruction and attempted obstruction of an official proceeding.

Over the past 18 months, about 30 people have been charged with joining terrorist groups in Syria and Iraq or trying to do so.

Pugh converted to Islam after moving to San Antonio, Texas, in 1998 and ""became increasingly radical in his beliefs,"" the feds said.

In 2001, while he was working as a mechanic for American Airlines, a coworker notified the FBI that Pugh had been expressing anti-American sentiment and that he sympathized with Osama bin Laden, authorities said.

Pugh will be arraigned before a federal judge on Wednesday. If convicted at trial, Pugh faces a maximum sentence of 35 years in prison.

She was 73.

The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence said in a Facebook post: ""We are heartbroken over the loss of Sarah Brady, our dear friend and Chairperson of the Brady Campaign and Center to Prevent Gun Violence. Sarah was a champion for gun violence prevention and her commitment and fiery compassion will live on.""

The organization did not specify a cause of death.

We are heartbroken over the loss of Sarah Brady, our dear friend and Chairperson of the Brady Campaign and Center to...

Jim Brady was seriously injured by the assassination attempt on then-President Ronald Reagan and confined to a wheelchair after the incident. He and his wife, Sarah, went on to become dedicated advocates for gun control, and he became the namesake for the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. Jim Brady died in August 2014.

""All of us at the Brady Campaign and Center to Prevent Gun Violence are heartbroken over the passing of Sarah Brady. Together with her husband Jim 'Bear’ Brady, Sarah was the heart and soul of this organization and the successful movement it has become today. In the history of our nation, there are few people, if any, who are directly responsible for saving as many lives as Sarah and Jim,"" said Brady Campaign and Center President Dan Gross in a statement.

""There are countless people walking around today who would not be were it not for Sarah Brady’s remarkable resilience, compassion and – what she always said she enjoyed the most -- her hard work in the trenches with this organization, which she continued right up to the very end.""

Former First Lady Nancy Reagan said Friday she was ""deeply saddened to hear about the passing of my dear friend.""

""Just over 34 years ago, we shared an experience that bonded us for life, as we comforted each other in a tiny, windowless office at the George Washington University Hospital Emergency Room, while awaiting word about whether our husbands would survive the horrific gunshots that had brought them there,"" Reagan said.

""Sarah and Jim’s path from that day on was, of course, much more difficult than Ronnie’s and mine, but Sarah never complained,"" Reagan added. ""Over the years, I found her to be a woman of immense courage, strength and optimism. I will miss Sarah very much, but take comfort in knowing that she joined Jim on Good Friday and is now at peace.""

Former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who was critically injured when she was shot in the head in January 2011, also expressed her condolences.

""We know Sarah will be missed by all those whose lives she touched and who were so inspired by her commitment to her late husband Jim and to the cause of reducing gun violence in our country,"" Giffords said in a joint statement with her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly -- co-founder of Americans for Responsible Solutions.

""Sarah Brady showed us not only what a tireless fight for common sense looks like, but also what it means to be a loving spouse and caretaker in the wake of a senseless tragedy. Our prayers are with her son Scott, her daughter Missy, and the entire Brady Campaign family as they mourn this devastating loss,"" they added in their statement.

Brady is survived by her and Jim’s son, James “Scott” Brady, Jr., and her stepdaughter, Melissa “Missy” Brady Camins."

Protesters faced off with police today outside the house where Tony Robinson was shot Friday night, and marchers carried banners saying ""Black Lives Matter.""

A community group planned to gather this afternoon to discuss the shooting. Organizers encouraged the community to bring children and crayons for a discussion about the events of the weekend.

A balloon memorial had been placed near the site of the shooting this morning.

Friends and family who gather Saturday night in front of the home where Robinson was shot told ABC News they were concerned about safety in their community.

""I worry about my kids even walking down the street,"" Lynn Robinson, a neighbor of Tony Robinson's, said.

""Us being teenagers and you know African American teenagers, you know it can happen to us,"" Darian Grant, a classmate of Robinson's, said.

Madison Police Chief Mike Koval identified the officer who shot and killed Robinson Friday night as Matt Kenny, 45, a 12-year veteran of the force.

Kenny was involved in a shooting in 2007, but was exonerated, Koval said.

Robinson's mother Andrea Irwin said she was shocked by his violent death, saying the teen was never a ""violent person.""

""It baffles me,"" she said.

According to court documents obtained by ABC News, Robinson pleaded guilty to charges of being a party to armed robbery in April 2014, and was under supervision when police responded to a complaint about him Friday night.

Robinson was jumping in and out of traffic on Friday night and allegedly responsible for a recent battery, Koval said.

In recordings of the 911 calls, police dispatchers discussing the suspect ""yelling and jumping in front of cars"" call him ""Tony.""

Kenny went to an apartment where he thought Robinson had gone, Koval said. The officer heard a disturbance inside and entered, where an altercation with Robinson began, the police chief said.

Koval said Kenny then shot Robinson, who later died at the hospital.

Kenny was also injured, said Koval, but he did not describe the extent of his wounds. The officer, who was involved in a police-involved shooting in 2007 and was exonerated of any wrongdoing, was placed on administrative leave with pay pending the outcome of the investigation, Koval said.

After Robinson's death late Friday, demonstrations condemning the shooting began. A crowd gathered at the house where the shooting happened and then left. Some people then headed to the downtown building that houses the Madison Police Department's Central District offices.

Robinson's family has urged demonstrators to remain peaceful in his honor.

Tuesday will be his 67th birthday.

FBI Director James Comey announced the increase on the bureau’s website, saying it is “long past time for Bob to come home.”

Levinson's family said in a statement to ABC News, ""Every year on this date, we remind the world that Bob's case is still not resolved and that this husband, father than grandfather is still not home where he belongs.""

Levinson, who served more than two decades with the FBI before retiring, was kidnapped from Kish Island off Iran’s southern coast on March 9, 2007. For years the U.S. government said Levinson was working at the time as a private investigator, but in December 2013 Levinson’s family acknowledged he was, in fact, working as a kind of freelance “spy” for a rogue CIA operation.

“The CIA sent Bob Levinson to Iran to do an investigation on its behalf,” family attorney David McGee said then.

McGee told ABC News at the time the CIA and the FBI betrayed Levinson as it tried to hide the fact that he had a long-term relationship with the CIA, spying on Iran’s nuclear program and on the Lebanese terror group Hezbollah in the rogue operation.

“[R]ather than acknowledge what they had done and try and save Bob’s life, they denied him,” McGee said.

The day Levinson was outed as spy for the CIA, then-White House Press Secretary Jay Carney declined to discuss the case, beyond saying Levinson was “not a U.S. government employee” when he was kidnapped. The CIA declined to comment on “any purported affiliation,” and only said, “The U.S. government remains committed to bringing him home safely to his family.”

Officials at the CIA and the White House National Security Council declined to comment for this report.

Levinson was last seen in so-called ""proof of life"" images in early 2013. He was wearing an orange jumpsuit, draped in chains and holding various signs, one of which said, ""Help me.""

The Iranian government has denied holding Levinson, but American officials have repeatedly said they suspect that at the very least, Iranian government officials know where he is.

Levinson has been held in captivity longer than any other American, according to the FBI. In 2012 the FBI announced a $1 million reward for information on Levinson’s location.

""We urge the governments of Iran and the United States to work together to resolve this case and send Bob home, so he can live the rest of his life quietly, surrounded by the family that loves him,"" the family statement today said."

“The rates are around $200 a night at that time,” Kappelmann said. “We were really shocked and thought, ‘Oh, my gosh. We don’t have a room for them and look at the rate that they have.’”

Kappelmann said when she checked the couple’s reservation, it showed that the room had not been booked with the hotel. It was reserved through ReservationCounter.com, an online agency Kappelmann said she had never heard of until then.

One couple was Kevin Childress and his wife, who had driven down from Baltimore, Maryland. Childress told ABC News that he thought he booked his room directly with the Flamingo Inn when he called a reservation number from what he said appeared to be the official hotel website. He failed to notice that his email confirmation wasn’t sent by the hotel and he learned too late that it was from a third-party site.

“They were enraged,” Kappelmann said.

Katherine Lugar, the president and CEO of American Hotel and Lodging Association (AHLA), said there have been an alarming uptick in complaints from consumers who say they believed they were booking with a hotel, only to find out later that they had given their information to a third-party agency called ReservationCounter.com.

“We really started to hear about the problem a few years ago, but in recent times, it has absolutely skyrocketed,” Lugar said.

Kappelmann said ReservationCounter.com told her that it experienced a system error that misdirected the Flamingo Inn bookings to a different hotel.

“It was a mistake,” Kappelmann said. “A glitch in the system, you know? They promised that they have our problem solved and I believe them.”

Kappelmann pointed out that all the trouble could have been avoided if the couple had not booked with a third party and dealt with the hotel directly.

Today, 14 percent of all hotel rooms sold are booked online, according to TravelClick.com, a hospitality industry research company, which amounts to about $22.8 billion a year. The majority of these rooms are reserved through online travel agencies like Expedia.com, Priceline.com and Booking.com, which get their inventory from hotels and other resources.

But there is also a second tier of booking sites affiliated with the big agencies also offering hotel rooms for sale, and this is where Lugar said consumers can run into trouble.

“Many of them actually look a lot like the hotel sites. But, in fact, they’re not,” she said.

These third-party websites show up in search results and as paid ads, and when consumers book a room through them, often unwittingly, common complaints with the reservations include confusing cancellation and refund policies, ignoring requests for disabled or family accommodations and lost or mis-booked reservations, according to the AHLA.

Almost 2.5 million potentially confusing bookings are made on third-party sites each year, according to the AHLA."

The injured man was identified as Kevin Fleming, 20, of Baltimore, according to law enforcement sources. Fleming and another man were in a stolen Ford Escape SUV when they encountered NSA police at the entrance to the Ft. Meade complex, sources said.

Shortly before 9 a.m. ET, a vehicle with two people inside ""attempted an unauthorized entry at a National Security Agency gate,"" according to a statement from the NSA.

""The driver failed to obey an NSA Police officer's routine instructions for safely exiting the secure campus,"" the statement continued. ""The vehicle failed to stop and barriers were deployed.""

Sources say the two inside were men dressed as women. Preliminary information indicated the two men were partying at an area hotel with a third individual when they took that individual's car without permission. However, it's still unclear how or why they ended up at the NSA gate.

The owner of the SUV picked up two men dressed as women in Baltimore late Sunday, sources confirmed. The three allegedly drove to a hotel in Howard County, Maryland, where they partied, sources said. Early this morning, the man woke up alone and the two men he allegedly had picked up were gone and so was his vehicle, sources said. The man reported his vehicle stolen to Howard County Police before the incident at the NSA, sources said.

A law enforcement source confirmed that the car that crashed at NSA was reported stolen in Howard County, Maryland.

When the vehicle ""accelerated toward an NSA police car blocking the road"" and ""refused to stop,"" an NSA police officer opened fire, and one of the two men inside the ""unauthorized vehicle"" ended up dead, the NSA statement said. The other man in the vehicle was ""severely injured” and taken to a local hospital, according to sources.

An NSA Police officer injured in the incident was also taken to the hospital.

“The incident has been contained and is under investigation,” Colonel Brian Foley, Fort Meade garrison commander, said in a statement. “The residents, service members and civilian employees on the installation are safe. We continue to remain vigilant at all of our access control points.""

The FBI said they do not believe the incident is related to terrorism.

Amy Poehler, Cameron Diaz and Lupita Nyong'o were among those who replaced their social media profile photos with a faceless avatar in honor of International Women's Day on Sunday.

The stunt was part of the Clinton Foundation's #NotThere campaign to call attention to gender inequality around the globe. Chelsea and Hillary Clinton led the way by swapping out their Twitter profile pictures.

I hope you’ll take a stand with me today by changing your profile picture & learning why we’re #NotThere yet http://t.co/zIhRMhJStY #IWD2015

Celebrities quickly followed suit.

""We're Not There ... Yet,"" Diaz wrote on her Instagram account. ""Inequality exists at work / at home / at the doctor's office / at school - and yet these issues do not get the attention they deserve. It's almost like we're NOT THERE at all.""

On her Instagram account, Nyong'o wrote, ""For International Women’s Day, I am taking a stand for gender equality and I'm joining others to be #NotThere.""

We #women deserve #equalrights #equalpay #equaleducation #equalopportunity we are #NotThere http://t.co/2V0SYqjgML #IntlWomensDay

On #InternationalWomensDay my photo is missing from @KateSpadeNY’s billboard. Learn why I’m #NotThere at http://t.co/K8g9KoXyVx @ClintonFdn

In addition to the social media campaign, the Clinton Foundation cut out women in dozens of existing ads, magazine covers and posters. Thus, Rosie the Riveter vanished from her iconic poster on a bus shelter in New York City and Serena Williams disappeared from a giant Beats billboard in Times Square.

Poehler, Diaz and other female celebrities explained the effort in a video on the campaign's website.

Other stars marked International Women's Day with their own messages.

""Girls"" star Allison Williams gave a fist bump to her co-stars on Instagram.

""So thankful to have so many strong women in my life. We're not there yet, but we're getting there. Going to be spending it with my GIRLS family at PaleyFest,"" she wrote."

Narcissistic individuals think they’re better than everyone else, live for personal success and expect exceptional treatment, explained the authors of the study that appeared in the latest issue of the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. When narcissists experience failure, they’re not pleasant to be around, sometimes even lashing out violently, the study notes

The study evaluated 565 Dutch children ages 7 through 12 for narcissist tendencies such as feelings of superiority and self-satisfaction. The investigators also questioned the children’s parents about how, when and how often they offered praise and other feedback.

The kids whose parents consistently told them they were superior to other children, no matter what, scored higher on measurements for narcissism compared to kids who were given a more realistic view of themselves, the investigators found. That’s because over-praising children can lead them to believe they are special people who deserve special treatment all the time, explained Brad Bushman, a professor of communication and psychology at Ohio State University and one of the study’s authors.

“Parents should be warm and loving, but not give their child blanket praise,” Bushman said. “We should not boost self-esteem and hope our children will behave well. Instead, we should praise our children after they do well.”

Dr. Gene Beresin, the executive director of Massachusetts General Hospital’s Clay Center for Young Healthy Minds, said he was skeptical about some of the study’s conclusions.

“In the first place, parents are just one influence on a child,” he said. “Teachers, peers, siblings and many others influence how a child feels about themselves and how they behave towards others.”

Beresin said American children are not necessarily the same as Dutch children. But what concerned him most is the age of the children in the study.

“I don’t see how you can label kids this young as narcissistic when it’s generally recognized that such personality traits aren’t fully formed until late adolescence, like around age 18,” he said.

Beresin said parents who build a bond of trust with their children by giving them honest feedback mixed with encouragement and support help build a child’s self-esteem and security. Positive feedback, as long as it’s accurate and appropriate, can only help boost a child’s self-worth, he said.

But the investigators said their work builds on a body of research that shows parental “overvaluation” leads to narcissism later in life because children tend to see themselves as the important people in their lives see them. The researchers didn’t rule out the effects of other influences like genetics but said previous work shows that cultivating an unreasonably confident view of self is at the core of narcissism."
1Molyyy,2015-02-15 00:00:00,The Youngest Faces in the Ukrainian Conflict - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/International/youngest-faces-ukrainian-conflict/story?id=28979173,"The cease-fire that went in effect in eastern Ukraine today may quiet the guns, but the echoes of 10 months of bombardment will likely ring in the ears of the child survivors of the conflict for the rest of their lives.

Just hours before the fighting was supposed to stop, Ekaterina and her 8-year-old brother Ivan played on a slide and jungle gym in a central park of Donetsk with the sound of heavy bombardment raining down around them.

But the two children, who had only left their basement shelter Saturday for some sunshine and fresh air as their mother went to buy food, ignored the explosions.

Ekaterina, who is just 5 years old, even explained that she could tell the difference between mortars, rockets, and other artillery by the sounds they made as they hit the ground.

For some, the pause in fighting came too late. The last few days, which saw increased shelling as both sides tried to lock in advantageous positions before the midnight deadline, were deadly for civilians -- adults and children alike.

While missiles fell close to the park where Ekaterina and her brother played, they also landed nearby where Alexander Zakharchenko, the rebel leader of the self-styled Donetsk People's Republic (DNR), was about to hold a news conference. Four shells that missed his headquarters killed three civilians and injured five.

Elsewhere, in the rebel-held town of Gorlovka, three children were killed as they took a bath at home, the building hit by shells fired by forces supporting the Ukrainian government.

In the city of Artemovsk, a 7-year-old was killed by fire from pro-Russian separatists.

Almost everybody hopes the ceasefire will hold, but few believe in it.

Zacharchenko said he had no intention of ceasing to fight in the ""internal regions of the DNR,"" including Debaltsevo, a railway junction town where Ukrainian forces are surrounded by the rebels.

""Any attempt to break out of Debaltsevo will be stopped by us,"" he said.

Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko warned that if separatists do not abide by the ceasefire, he will impose martial law throughout Ukraine's territory, his spokesman told ABC News."
1Mpk2v1,2015-03-10 00:00:00,Superfoods That Work Better Together - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Health/superfoods-work/story?id=29511584,"Peanut butter and jelly. Soup and salad. Spaghetti and meatballs. There are a few classic pairings that will never go out of style. But some food duos do more than just excite your taste buds—they could even boost your health. It's a concept called ""food synergy."" While eating a variety of nutrient-rich foods is key for helping your body stay healthy, the idea is that some foods can interact in ways to provide even more value. So stick to eating your favorite superfoods, but know that serving these 11 combos could pack a more powerful punch of nutrition.

Black beans are a good source of iron. Thing is, the iron in plant foods, known as non-heme iron, isn't as readily absorbed as the iron you'll find in meat. ""Just 2% to 20% of the iron in plant foods makes its way from your digestive tract into your blood, compared to 15% to 35% from heme animal-based iron,"" says Cynthia Sass, RD, MPH, Health's contributing nutrition editor and author of Slim Down Now: Shed Pounds and Inches with Real Food, Real Fast ($27; amazon.com). That's where vitamin C-rich foods, like red bell pepper, come in. They can increase the absorption of non-heme iron by six times, Sass says. Her go-to dish: black bean tacos topped with sautéed red bell peppers.

12 Foods With More Vitamin C Than an Orange

Like beans, the iron and zinc you find in whole grains have low bioavailability, meaning they get metabolized faster than your body can absorb them. ""Whole grains contain natural substances that may bind with minerals, which make them less absorbable,"" Sass says. But research shows that sulfur-rich foods, such as garlic and onion, could make whole grains even more nutritious. A 2010 study in theJournal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry found that the addition of garlic and onion to cooked or raw food grains enhanced the accessibility of iron and zinc in both cases. Pair the two by baking onions or garlic right into bread, Sass says, or try adding a generous serving of onions to your sandwich.

You already know that olive oil is a heart-healthy fat shown to boost ""good"" HDL cholesterol and lower ""bad"" LDL cholesterol that can clog your arteries. When paired with tomatoes, though, it has even more superpowers. A 2000 study in Free Radical Biology and Medicine had people consume tomato products with extra-virgin olive oil or sunflower oil. Researchers found that olive oil raised the antioxidant activity of the lycopene in tomatoes, while no effect was seen with the sunflower oil. ""There are numerous delicious combinations, including bruschetta, roasted red pepper pesto, or simply sautéing tomatoes in olive oil with garlic and herbs to toss with lean protein and a small portion of whole grain pasta,"" Sass says.

Best Superfoods for Weight Loss

To get the most out of your calcium intake, consuming enough vitamin D is key. ""Vitamin D helps absorb calcium from the GI tract into the blood and helps maintain a normal calcium level in the blood,"" Sass says. The National Institutes of Health recommends adult women get 600 IU of vitamin D daily. Bare skin exposed to sunlight triggers vitamin D production in your body, but you can also get it by eating certain foods, including salmon. Sass suggests grilling the fish over a bed of sautéed collard greens, which just happen to be rich in bone-boosting calcium.

When combined, these two appear to have some impressive cancer-fighting powers. In a 2007 study for Cancer Research, over five months rats were fed varying diets of either broccoli, tomatoes, or both foods. Researchers then tested how effective the different diet combinations were in slowing down the growth of prostate tumor implants. They found that diets containing 10% tomato and 10% broccoli caused a 52% decrease in tumor weights, whereas the diet with just tomatoes saw a 34% decrease and the diet with just broccoli had a 42% decrease. ""You could toss steamed broccoli with sundried tomato pesto,"" Sass suggests. ""Or sauté the florets and tomatoes in olive oil with seasoning.""

Superfoods That Fight Colds

Forget adding honey to green tea. Research shows you may be better off sprinkling in some black pepper. Green tea already has a special antioxidant called EGCG, which is thought to boost metabolism and protect against cancer. But the key chemical in black pepper, known as piperine, could make EGCG work even more efficiently. In a 2004 study for The Journal of Nutrition, researchers injected mice with either a combination of EGCG and piperine or EGCG alone. They found that piperine increased the absorption of EGCG, so it wasn't broken down as quickly in the blood stream. Don't want your tea to have a spicy kick? Use the pair to soak meat or seafood. ""Brewed tea with garlic, ginger, and black pepper makes a perfect marinade,"" Sass says.

The piperine in black pepper works with more than one food. You may have heard turmeric called the healing spice. That's because it packs a powerful antioxidant, curcumin, which has anti-inflammatory, antiseptic, and antibacterial agents, says Melissa Rifkin, RD, a bariatric dietitian at Montefiore Medical Center in New York City. Thing is, curcumin gets metabolized quickly before it can be fully absorbed. ""If you pair the turmeric with the piperine, it improves the bioavailability of curcumin by 1000 times,"" Rifkin says. Her ideal food pairing: Prepare a chicken dish that's made with turmeric and add a little black pepper.

These mini-cabbages pack several key nutrients, including vitamin K. ""It regulates blood clotting in our bodies and it also may be helpful for bone health,"" says Keri Gans, RD, author of The Small Change Diet: 10 Steps to a Thinner and Healthier You($8; amazon.com). Vitamin K is a fat-soluble vitamin, meaning it's best absorbed in a meal that contains fat. That's where the olive oil comes in. It mostly containsmonounsaturated fats, which are thought to help lower your risk of heart disease. Prep these two by lightly sautéing the veggies in olive oil, Gans says. You'll boost your intake of vitamin K and keep your heart happy too.

Another veggie chockfull of vitamin K is kale, but the superfood is also a good source of vitamin E, an antioxidant that boosts our immune systems and protects against cancer and heart disease. ""Some research suggests it could also be good for healthy skin,"" Gans says. But like vitamin K, vitamin E is fat-soluble, so you'll need a nutritious source of fat to increase its absorption. Almonds make a good partner for the veggie as the nut is full of monounsaturated fat. And pairing the two couldn't be easier. Gans suggests topping a kale salad with slivered almonds. Bonus: ""Almonds have both vitamin E and are a healthy fat, so it's a win-win,"" Gans says.

5 Natural Appetite Suppressants That Really Work

This pairing won't just satisfy your sweet tooth. Together, dark chocolate and apples have the potential to improve cardiovascular health, Rifkin says. In their skins, apples—red delicious especially—contain the flavonoid quercetin, which acts like an anti-inflammatory. On the other hand, the cocoa in dark chocolate is rich in catechins, an antioxidant that helps prevent the hardening of arteries, Rifkin says. ""When paired, they have been shown to help break up blood clots,"" Rifkin says. Even more reason to start dipping your apple slices in a little chocolate goodness. Just remember: the dark kind has six times more catechins than milk chocolate, Rifkin says.

Garlic is one way to make your fish more flavorful. Together, the two foods may also work to decrease your risk of heart disease. A 1997 study in The American Journal of Nutrition tested the effects of the pair on men with high cholesterol. In the groups who consumed 900 milligrams of garlic and 12 grams of fish oil, total cholesterol levels and LDL levels decreased by 12.2% and 9.5% respectively. That's great news since too much cholesterol can clog up your blood vessels and impair blood flow. It's possible combining both garlic and salmon in a meal may offer similar benefits. Next time, try cooking up your fish with a little garlic, Rifkin suggests.

""Whether it’s repeal or whether it’s some language change that makes it self evident that there’s no discriminatory practices that could be condoned under this model is a decision they’re going to have to make, but they need to deal with it,"" Emmert told ESPN in an interview today.

Indiana Gov. Mike Pence last week signed into law Indiana Senate Bill 101, a version of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act on the books in other states and at the federal level. It simply states that the government must prove a higher threshold of government interest when enforcing widely applied laws where they infringe on anyone's free exercise of religion. Both opponents and supporters have said it would allow for businesses to deny services to gays and lesbians, for instance if a Christian wedding photographer were uncomfortable being hired to photograph a gay wedding.

Indiana's Republican House speaker and Senate president pro tem said earlier today they will push their colleagues to make changes to the bill to clarify that it is not intended to allow denial of services based on sexual preference.

The law is slated to go into effect this July.

The NCAA is headquartered in Indianapolis, where the men's basketball Final Four will be played this weekend, and Emmert was one of the first figures outside politics to voice ""concern"" over the law when Pence signed it last week.

In the interview today, Emmert said the NCAA is proud that it has championed diversity for its athletes and employees and alluded to future problems for sporting events--and the NCAA's presence--in the state if the law stands.

""For us personally in the NCAA, this is a big deal. We’re very proud of the environment we’ve created here, and we don’t want to lose that. We don’t want to have it put at risk,"" Emmert said.

Emmert also hinted that the NCAA could move next year's women's basketball Final Four if the law stands.

""We have to evaluate this,"" Emmert said. ""We, the NCAA, have to sit down and say, if this environment remains where it is, what does this mean for us going forward?""

In an interview with ABC's George Stephanopoulos over the weekend, Pence would not say whether the law would allow for denial of services to gays and lesbians, and Emmert said recent statements by the Indiana public officials have left uncertainty over what the law does.

""Before we get that far down the road [in repealing or changing the law], we need to get a better feel for what it really means,"" Emmert said."
1MqlzEs,2015-03-31 00:00:00,"Iran Nuclear Talks: As Deadline Nears, Sticking Points Fester - ABC News",http://abcnews.go.com/International/iran-nuclear-talks-deadline-nears-sticking-points-fester/story?id=30015514,"With just over 24 hours until the deadline for negotiating parties to come to a political understanding about ending Iran’s nuclear weapons program, the most contentious issues within the talks have yet to be resolved.

Negotiators still have not reached an agreement on how many centrifuges might remain online at Iran’s deep buried Fordo nuclear reactor, whether or not Iran will be allowed to continue nuclear research and development for scientific purposes, and what to do with the stockpile of enriched uranium already owns, officials said today.

In what many observers see as a downgrade from the optimistic outlook at the end of last week, State Department spokesman Marie Harf said there’s a ""50/50"" chance a tentative deal could be reached. Speaking to reporters today in a teleconference from Lausanne, Switzerland, Harf said the mood is “serious” but that “there is still a path” to a deal.

“It’s like moving puzzle pieces around,” Harf said. “We have to find the right combination.”

Though the next deadline expires tomorrow, there is nothing that says the talks would have to stop if that deadline passes, according to the State Department. The November Joint Plan of Action technically extends through June 30.

“On April 1st, it’s not like something happens,” Harf said.

It's unclear, however, that talks would continue if a tentative deal is not reached by March 31.

Secretary of State John Kerry is in Switzerland leading the negotiations. State Department officials said he had hoped to back in Boston on Monday for a dedication ceremony at the new Edward Kennedy Institute, honoring the late senator from Massachusetts, who was a close colleague and friend of Kerry’s.

President Obama explained Kerry’s absence at the ceremony, then quoted John F. Kennedy in summing up the nuclear negotiations with Iran.

""Let us never negotiate out of fear. But let us never fear to negotiate,"" Obama said.

Meanwhile, at the White House, spokesman Eric Schultz addressed some of the sticking points in the negotiations, pushing back on reports that Iran has reneged on its pledge to export much of its stockpile.

“The idea that there had been an agreement that Iran backed away from is not true,” Schultz said. “Nothing is agreed to until everything is agreed to.”"
1Mr4SGu,2015-02-16 00:00:00,Presidents Day 2015: 12 Things You Didn't Know About Past US Commanders in Chief - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/presidents-day-2015-12-things-past-us-commanders/story?id=28997278,"Presidents Day is the federal holiday reserved for honoring the leading men of our country. It’s officially ""Washington's Birthday,"" but the name has evolved informally over the years to honor not just the first president, but all 43 of them.

Keeping this theme in mind, here are 12 fun facts you probably didn't know about our past commanders in chief, with some help from Steven Noll, an expert historian and senior lecturer at the University of Florida.

One Family’s Presidents Day Tradition You Have to See to Believe

Martin Van Buren, the eighth U.S. president, had an interesting nickname during his presidency, Noll says. Many referred to Van Buren as ""Old Kinderhook,"" after his house along the Hudson River in upstate New York. His supporters would shout ""OK,"" for short, in rallies, according to NPR.

Could you ever imagine a bathtub without running water? Neither can we, and apparently neither could the nation's 13th president from 1850 to 1853, Millard Fillmore.  Fillmore was the first president to have a bathtub with running water.

James Buchanan served as president from 1857 to 1861, making him the 15th president. He was the first unmarried president to be elected into office. Grover Cleveland, the nation's 22nd president, was also elected into office unmarried but, unlike Buchanan, Cleveland married while holding his position in office, according to WhiteHouseHistory.org.

Rutherford B. Hayes, the 19th president, was the first president to have a phone installed in the White House. And while this fun fact isn't about Hayes, it is about his wife, Lucy Hayes. The first lady refused to serve alcohol at the White House because she believed in the temperance movement, thus lending her the nickname, ""Lemonade Lucy.""

Benjamin Harrison, the 23rd president, was the first commander in chief to install electricity in the White House, according to WhiteHouseHistory.org. Harrison served four years in office, from 1889 to 1893, and installed electricity in 1891. Another interesting fact: Harrison was the last president to have a beard, and also the first president to have a Christmas tree in the White House.

William Taft, born in 1857, served as the nation's 27th president from 1909 to 1913. During his presidency, Taft was the first president to throw out a pitch during a baseball game. That first pitch was in the 1910 Senator's Opening Day game against the Philadelphia Athletics.

It is said that Taft is also the one who helped to coin the term ""seventh-inning stretch."" Taft got up during the seventh inning of a game to stretch his legs because he could bear sitting down no more, Professor Noll says. The crowd got up to honor their president, but when the president returned a few minutes later, the crowd followed suit, thus giving the name, the ""seventh-inning stretch.""

Today, transatlantic traveling of our president is the norm. It seems like almost every other week President Obama is in another country. But, interestingly enough, Woodrow Wilson, the 28th president from 1913 to 1921, was the first president to cross the Atlantic Ocean while in office.

The nation's 30th president, Calvin Coolidge, was commonly known as ""Silent Cal"" because he enjoyed childish practical jokes such as buzzing for his bodyguards and then hiding under his desk as they frantically searched for him,"" according to HistoryToday.com.

Ever wonder how the “Star-Spangled Banner “became our National Anthem? We have President Herbert Hoover to thank for that. Hoover, the 31st president, signed a law that made the ""Star-Spangled Banner"" our National Anthem based on an 1814 poem by Francis Scott Key, according to History.com.

Random fact: It is also said that Hoover’s son, Allan, had pet alligators that wandered around the White House, according to CNN.

Gerald Ford, our nation's 38th president, was surprisingly domestic. This down-to-earth president enjoyed cooking his own breakfast, Noll says. The Gerald Ford Foundation website also goes onto say that Ford even enjoyed making his own muffins. Who's hungry for breakfast?

Jimmy Carter, our 39th president, was the first president to be born in a hospital. Carter served in modern years, from 1977 to 1981, thus begging the question, where were the other presidents born before him?

Ronald Reagan, one of the nation's most likeable presidents, served as our 40th president from 1981 to 1989.  Reagan, born in 1911, didn't become president until 1981, 70 years later, thus making him the nation’s oldest president to have ever served."

“We have excellent news to give because an hour ago two Spaniards who were believed to be missing, were found alive by our Spanish consulate officials,“ Spain’s Foreign Minister José García-Margallo told reporters today.

The couple, Juan Carlos Sanchez and wife Cristina Rubio, who is four months pregnant, scrambled to safety by hiding but were apparently too frightened to use their cellphones to raise the alarm, García-Margallo added.

“They spent the whole night hidden in the museum and didn’t even dare to use their cellphones, which is why we were unable to contact them,’’ García-Margallo said, adding that because Rubio is pregnant, ‘’she has been taken to a hospital for check-ups.”

It's unclear where they hid in the museum.

Garcia-Margallo explained that consular officials and police had searched all night for the couple, to no avail, but they were never listed among the dead.

Spain was planning to send a plane to Tunisia today to get them safely home, the Spanish Foreign Ministry said."

The cloud was first observed by amateur astronomers in March 2012 quickly appearing and then vanishing. A second iteration of the haze followed the same pattern in April of the same year and stretched more than 600 miles across the thin Martian atmosphere, according to scientists.

What the features had in common was how they developed over the span of just a few hours and remained visible for around 10 days, with the structure consistently changing.

The haze was not photographed by spacecraft orbiting Mars at the time because of ""their viewing geometries and illumination conditions at the time,"" the European Space Agency said.

An image taken by the Hubble Telescope on May 17, 1997, reveals a similar cloud lingering high in Mars' atmosphere. Scientists are now studying the image and comparing it to the ones taken by amateur astronomers in the spring of 2012.

Agustin Sanchez-Lavega, the lead author on a paper about the Mars mystery published in the journal ""Nature,"" said that while there isn't an official explanation, he has several theories about what may have caused the haze.

""One idea we've discussed is that the features are caused by a reflective cloud of water-ice, carbon dioxide-ice or dust particles, but this would require exceptional deviations from standard atmospheric circulation models to explain cloud formations at such high altitudes,"" he said.

Another theory: The haze may be an auroral emission."

In a new public service announcement released today, Kate makes an appeal on behalf of Place2Be as the charity launches its first Children's Mental Health Week in the U.K.

In the video that's just about two minutes long, Kate talks about the challenges to children's mental health -- including bullying, bereavement, domestic violence and family problems.

Without support, she says, those challenges can become traumatic, leading to mental health problems in children such as anxiety, depression, addiction and self-harm.

""The stigma around mental health means that many children do not get the help that they so badly need. This needs to change. That is why the charity Place2Be is asking us all to talk openly this week,"" Kate, 33, said. ""We need to help young people and their parents understand that it's not a sign of weakness to ask for help.""

She also said a child's mental health was ""just as important as their physical health and deserves the same quality of support,"" noting that ""no one would be embarrassed"" to seek help for a child with a broken arm.

""We really should be equally ready to support a child coping with emotional difficulties,"" Kate, wearing a long-sleeved, belted, blue print dress and with her hair down, added.

Kate also said she and her husband, Prince William, sincerely believe early action can prevent problems in childhood from becoming more serious later in life.

""That is why we're both supporting Place2Be this Children's Mental Health Week, and I hope you'll join us,"" she said.

Kate is pregnant with the couple's second child, due in late April. They don't know the child's gender as they want it to be a surprise. Their first child, George, is 19 months.

Place2Be is a charity that provides emotional support to children more than 230 schools across the United Kingdom. Kate is the organization's royal patron.

According to Place2Be's website, depression and anxiety have increased among teenagers by 75 percent in the past 25 years, and three children in every classroom have a diagnosable mental health problem. The organization also said children were less likely to suffer from serious mental health difficulties later in life if they receive support at an early age.

Children's Mental Health Week officially launches on Monday."
1MsdxJ0,2015-02-16 00:00:00,Why Doctors Say Crawling Across the Finish Line Isn't a Great Idea - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Health/doctors-crawling-finish-line-great-idea/story?id=28998255,"A marathoner crawled across the finish line this weekend after her body gave out, and while the grit and determination may be admirable, doctors said they worry that other runners may be inspired to do the same instead of listening to their bodies to stop.

Elite runner Hyvon Ngetich was leading the pack 23 miles into the Austin Marathon this weekend, but then her body just couldn't go any further. Ngetich found herself on all fours, but she refused to accept a wheelchair and crawled the final few miles to the finish line, she told local TV station KHOU.

""You ran the bravest race and crawled the bravest crawl I have ever seen in my life,"" race director John Conley told her afterwards. ""You have earned much honor.""

When asked why she didn't quit, Ngetich, a native of Kenya, said, ""Running, always you have to keep going, going.""

But Dr. Laura Goldberg, a sports medicine specialist at Cleveland Clinic and medical director of the Cleveland Marathon, said sometimes runners just need to stop.

""For the non-elite crowd, there should never be a reason why runner a should crawl to the finish,"" Goldberg said. ""I get nervous about hearing this story, how it translates through the general population.""

She said dehydration, overheating and muscle cramping could have all led Ngetich to crawl to the finish line, but non-elite runners shouldn't follow her example no matter how miraculous her perseverance.

Here's what to look for:

-Your mental status has changed. While it's normal for runners' thinking to change slightly during a marathon due to exhaustion, if you forget where you are or why you're running, stop, Goldberg said. This can be a sign of overheating, an electrolyte problem, dehydration or something else, said Dr. Carl ""Chip"" Lavie, a cardiologist at the Ochsner Center in New Orleans.

-You've stopped sweating or you have chills. This means your body isn't able to regulate its temperature properly. ""Sweat is a way to let off heat,"" Goldberg said.

-Cramping is all over. Runners are used to cramps, but if it's a body-wide feeling, don't push through it, she said.

-Your heart is racing faster than usual. This can be a sign your heart is in trouble, and you could pass out even if you're an elite runner, Lavie said.

-You're experiencing chest pain, shortness of breath or feeling faint. Again, your heart is telling you it's in trouble, and you should stop, he said.

Though distance runners are used to pushing through pain, Lavie said they should recognize when it's time to stop."

Many mushers use iPods during the annual race in Alaska, which stretches more than 1,000 miles from Anchorage to Nome, however Sass' downfall was bringing the iPod Touch version, which is capable of connecting to Wi-Fi.

""I didn't use it and I had zero intent of using it for a Wi-Fi connection in checkpoints, but I was just completely clueless,"" he told Alaska Public Radio. ""I mean, I gave my dad my cell phone because I knew you couldn't have cell phones on this race specifically and I was just ignorant.""

Sass was in fifth place with his team of dogs when he was disqualified Tuesday. The Yukon Quest Champion reiterated to his fans that he had no intention of cheating on the course.

Iditarod officials were sympathetic to Sass' issue but had to enforce Rule 35 of the competition, which prohibits two-way communication devices, according to a statement from the race director Mark Nordman.

Mushers are allowed to carry one-way communication devices with satellite tracking that can be used in the event of an emergency. If the device is activated, a musher is automatically withdrawn from the competition."

The heist happened around midnight local time, and no casualties have been reported, according to French media.

A spokesperson from the company running the tolls told ABC News that two trucks were found abandoned and burned on a plot of land nearby.

The individuals responsible were still on the run and an authority in Paris was tasked with the inquiry in conjunction with local officials.

French media reported the trucks were carrying $9.5 million worth of jewelry, adding the robbers moved the contents in getaway vans that they later abandoned in a field in Quenne, France, 20 miles north.

There have been series of recent heists in France, including three on the Champs Elysee in Paris last year."

The escaped prisoner, Wossen Assaye, was identified by a bus passenger who recognized him on the bus and called police, a law enforcement source told ABC News.

The suspect was arrested in Washington, D.C., by Metropolitan Police Department without incident at 25th and Pennsylvania Avenue SE, law enforcement sources added.

Assaye earlier prompted a lockdown at Inova Fairfax Hospital, in Falls Church, Virginia, less than 10 miles southwest of Washington, D.C., authorities said.

Assaye had been taken to the hospital for injuries sustained during a suicide attempt last Friday, officials said. For the first 24 hours of his hospital treatment, he was watched by Alexandria County sheriff’s deputies, and after that, responsibility for security went to security contractor Allied Protective Services.

At 3 a.m. this morning, Assaye overpowered a female security guard at the hospital and took her gun, Fairfax County Police Chief Edwin Roessler said today after Assaye was captured.

Next, Assaye confronted a male security officer, according to Bobby Mathieson of the U.S. Marshals Service. Mathieson said the male officer fired a shot but no one was hit -- though Roessler said it was unknown who fired the shot.

Assaye then escaped through a hospital stairwell, officials said. Authorities say they don't know what restraints were on him. He was wearing a hospital gown and no shoes at the time.

Police are looking for this escaped prisoner. He is wearing a hospital gown and no shoes & armed with a gun. pic.twitter.com/sMtvEYkWeL

Authorities said they did not know if the escape was pre-planned.

Assaye fled to a residential neighborhood and broke into the trunk of a 2002 silver Toyota Camry, authorities said. When the owner of the car started to drive to work, Assaye kicked his way out of the trunk and carjacked the vehicle, police said.

The driver was slightly injured during the carjacking, police said.

Around 10:30 a.m., the Camry was found abandoned. Assaye then carjacked another car and fled, police said.

The second car, a 2008 Hyundai Elantra, has also been located, police said after Assaye's capture.

Police said a weapon has been recovered.

Suspect abandoned the first stolen vehicle and has stolen a second one. We are now looking for a dark gray Hyundai Elantra w/VA: XTU-5024

A heavy police presence was reported near the hospital, and police vehicles were seen blocking the hospital’s entrances during the search for the prisoner. Hospital employees were being sent to a nearby high school, and a shuttle bus was carrying the employees to work during the lockdown, police said.

Assaye made his initial appearance in a federal courtroom in Alexandria, Virginia, this afternoon. He was charged with one count of escape from custody in addition to the charge he is already facing for armed robbery.

Assaye appeared ""heavily shackled"" and escorted by four deputy U.S. marshals, a law enforcement source said.

His next appearance will be Friday afternoon.

According to a court complaint, Assaye was accused in a string of bank robberies in eastern Virginia between October 2013 and March 20, 2015. In each situation, authorities say, the perpetrator entered the bank -- often with a cell phone to his ear -- either displayed a handgun or demand note, and verbally demanded money.

Assaye had a criminal history, with convictions for multiple burglary and robbery offenses in 1998 and 1999, and served time in prison between 2000 and May 2013, according to the complaint.

Working together, scientists at the University of Washington and the University of Johannesburg in South Africa found evidence that life may have thrived on Earth 3.2 billion years ago, upending the belief that Earth's atmosphere at the time was uninhabitable.

The study is based on an analysis of 52 rock samples collected in South Africa and northwestern Australia and range in age from 2.75 to 3.2 billion years old.

Roger Buick, a University of Washington professor and co-author of the article that was published Monday in the journal Nature, said the rock samples his team analyzed showed that there was plentiful nitrogen 3.2 billion years ago to sustain the most basic life forms, including bacteria, viruses and other organisms.

While life can exist without oxygen, nitrogen is an essential building block for genes.

""People always had the idea that the really ancient biosphere was just tenuously clinging on to this inhospitable planet, and it wasn't until the emergence of nitrogen fixation that suddenly the biosphere become large and robust and diverse,"" Buick told UW Today."

The glove worn by Jeffrey Maier on Oct. 9, 1996 is part of a sale through Heritage Auctions.

Maier, then 12, skipped school to attend Game 1 of the American League Championship Series between the Yankees and Orioles at Yankee Stadium.

Tarasco was furious, pointing upward and screaming at a nearby umpire about the fan interference.

But the home run stood, and the game was tied. The Yankees went on to win the game 5-4, and then the series. The Yankees went on to win the 1996 World Series, snapping an 18-year championship drought.

According to Heritage Auctions, the black leather Mizuno glove – which Maier sold to the current owner -– features “Maier” printed “in child-like block lettering on the wrist” and shows “solid sandlot use.” Bidding on the glove has reached $13,000, with three days remaining in the auction."

1MuK9US,2015-03-31 00:00:00,5-Year-Old Detroit Shooting Victim Trades an Eye for an 'Aye' in Pirate-Themed Party - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Health/year-detroit-shooting-victim-trades-eye-aye-pirate/story?id=30029222,"Five-year-old Donovan Lyles Jr. was playing video games at his home on Detroit’s east side in January when he was struck by a stray bullet as a result of a random shooting. He went on to lose his eye, but not his spirit.

“When I told him his eye was gone he said he would just have to become a pirate then,” his mother Emily Brazelton told ABC News, adding that the boy never panicked or cried, remaining calm throughout the entire ordeal.

His words touched the hearts of a local theater troupe, Captain Fishbones and the Pirates of the Forgiven.

After one of its members saw his story on the local news, they decided to throw him a pirate themed party.

DJ, as he is known to friends and family was christened “DJ the Daring” at the party, Carole Cross, the troupe’s “purser” told ABC News.

“That’s now his official pirate name,” she said.

The party was held at a local pirate-themed restaurant in nearby St Clair Shores, Michigan. Guests came decked out in swashbuckling costumes complete with eye patches in honor of the boy, Cross said.

Lyles was shy when he first entered the room, his mom said. But once he realized it was a party just for him he couldn’t stop sword fighting and hugging everyone he met. He and his two sisters, Emory and Eternity, were especially thrilled with the gift bags full of “treasures”, Brazelton added.

Her son has always been an upbeat and resilient child, Brazelton said. He became interested in pirates after watching the movie “Pirates of the Caribbean”, she said.

No one has been arrested for the shooting, Brazelton said, and the family moved to a safer neighborhood the day the boy was released from the hospital. She was fired from her job as a grocery cashier shortly after the incident because she was unable to work while caring for her son, she said.

Despite everything, Brazelton said she is thankful for the wonderful party -- and thankful in general.

“That same night a little girl was shot and she didn’t make it,” Brazelton said. “I feel ridiculously grateful that I didn’t lose my baby."""

Testing on the letter is ongoing to determine what, if any, danger it may have posed.

The letter was received Monday at the White House Mail Screening Center, and after initial biological testing came up negative, subsequent chemical testing came up with the positive for cyanide.

The sample was transported to another facility to confirm the results, the Secret Service said.

The substance was inside a plastic Ziploc-like bag inside an envelope, sources familiar with the case told ABC News."
1MumRuX,2015-03-11 00:00:00,What It's Like to Ride Inside Russia's Soyuz Spacecraft - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/ride-inside-russias-soyuz-spacecraft/story?id=29558631,"When U.S. astronaut Barry Wilmore stepped inside Russian's cramped Soyuz capsule tonight for his trip back to Earth, he was in for a wild ride.

NASA has been purchasing seats for American astronauts on board the Soyuz since the 2011 retirement of the shuttle program. The agreement helps the United States maintain its presence in space as Boeing and SpaceX work on vehicles expected to be ready near the end of 2017.

Doug Wheelock, an astronaut who has traveled in both the Discovery Space Shuttle and the Soyuz, said the two experiences are notably different.

""It's incredibly bumpy and hot and cramped,"" Wheelock told ABC News. ""It's kind of like going over Niagara Falls in a barrel but the barrel is on fire.""

The group began undocking the Soyuz from the International Space Station today at 6:44 p.m. ET and landed in Kazakhstan about 10:07 p.m. While the roughly 249 mile freefall back to Earth took about 45 minutes, the process for making sure they arrived at their destination was far more complex.

The Soyuz stayed close to the ISS for about two revolutions of the Earth as it fired its engines to align with the landing site. The crew members on board the spacecraft then turned their de-orbit engines in the direction of travel and fired them for four to five minutes before falling back to Earth.

""You have a lot of G-forces pushing you down. You're watching parts of your spaceship burn up outside of your window. It’s a little alarming visually,"" Wheelock said. ""And then, of course, the heat shield on the Soyuz is ablative. It melts off and chunks roll off as you're coming through the atmosphere so, consequently, [it] gets thinner and thinner.""

The atmosphere helped slow the Soyuz down until parachutes opened and the spacecraft glided to a landing. The three astronauts were inside cramped quarters, bracing themselves for what had the potential to be a jolting return to Earth.

""They train you to keep your hands and arms inside of your body enclosure to make sure you don’t break anything,"" Wheelock said. ""You get as small as you can. When you hit, some people stick the landing. We bounced. We hit again and rolled over. It depends on the winds and things like that.""

After landing, it's another 10 to 20 minutes before the Soyuz hatch was opened and the astronauts are pulled out, placed in reclining seats and carried to an area where they typically give their first press briefing.

The astronauts are then taken to a medical tent, Wheelock said, where under professional supervision they can try standing up for the first time in months, a feat that isn't always easy after living in a zero-gravity environment.

""A lot of people feel a tingling in the bottoms of their feet,"" he said. ""The nerve endings in your feet are feeling your body weight for first time in months."""

Lily Groesbeck survived 14 hours in the submerged wrecked car in freezing temperatures before being rescued by first responders on Saturday. The car was found partially in a river, with water so frigid rescuers could only stay in the water a few moments at time.

Initially rescuers did not initially realize the 18-month-old was in the car, although officers and firefighters at the scene reported hearing a voice asking for help before locating Lilly. Officials said they believe Lily's mother was killed on impact.

After being rescued, Lily was initially taken to Primary Children's Hospital in Salt Lake City in stable condition. She was released from the hospital today, according to a hospital spokesperson.

""Her improvement is astounding. Right now she's watching Dora and singing 'Wheels on the Bus' with Grandpa,"" Lily's aunt Jill Sanderson wrote on the family's fundraising page earlier this week. ""She is smiling and laughing for family members. We're blown away by Lily's progress and so grateful to her rescuers."""
1MvgVCE,2015-02-23 00:00:00,Possible American Accent Detected in ISIS Horror Video - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/International/american-accent-detected-isis-horror-video/story?id=29034317,"U.S. intelligence officials are analyzing facial features and speech patterns of the masked man who spoke in a recent ISIS video to determine who he is, and if he could be one of ISIS’s American recruits, according to a senior U.S. official.

The masked man speaks briefly in the video, which purports to show the gruesome execution of 21 Coptic Christians in Libya, declaring that ISIS’s Libyan affiliate is “on the south of Rome,” an apparent reference to ISIS’s expansion into Libya and the threat it poses to the West.

As in the hunt for the ISIS fighter dubbed “Jihadi John,” U.S. officials are conducting detailed analysis of the clues on the video. In the “Jihadi John” videos, believed to have been shot in Syria, authorities say they have been able to identify that masked figure with a British accent who appeared to murder Western journalists and aid workers. He is believed to be a British citizen, officials say, though he has not been publicly named.

The potential role of an American ISIS recruit – which would not be a first for the terror group -- comes as the White House today began a three-day effort with community leaders to stem the flow of the terror pipeline from the U.S. to the Middle East.

One front on which ISIS has been successful in recruitment, analysts and U.S. officials have said, is on social media. J.M. Berger, terrorism expert and author of a forthcoming book on ISIS, estimates that the group has 30,000 to 40,000 supporters active online every day.

The U.S. State Department has attempted to counter ISIS propaganda by engaging would-be jihadis one-on-one online, sometimes by calling adult ISIS fighters cowards who use women recruits only for sex. Some analysts say the U.S. campaign of insults misses the mark.

“It’s not impacting the people who may be inspired by the ISIS ideology and will carry out attacks on its behalf,” said John Cohen, former Counterterrorism Coordinator at the Department of Homeland Security and current ABC News consultant."

The incident, which was first reported by the Washington Post, is being investigated by the Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General.

The White House said today that President Obama is aware of the allegations and supports Secret Service Director Joe Clancy’s decision to turn the investigation over to the DHS Inspector General for a thorough review.

“We are aware of the alleged incident,” an Obama administration official told ABC News. “At the request of the Secret Service Director, Joe Clancy, the Department of Homeland Security’s Office of the Inspector General is conducting an investigation into the allegations. We’re not going to comment further while that investigation is ongoing.”

Both agents have been reassigned to non-operational assignments pending the outcome of the investigation.

The suspect was identified as Richard White, 62, a taxi driver, Jefferson Parish Sheriff Newell Normand said in a press conference Friday night.

The officer fired three shots, one of which grazed a TSA agent running from White, according to John Fortunato, a public information officer for Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office. Two other TSA officers were sprayed with the wasp repellent. Two other people received minor injuries fleeing the scene.

The officer who shot White was identified by Fortunato as Lieutenant Heather Sylve, a 7 1/2 year veteran of the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office. According to a press release, White was swinging a machete at Sylve when she opened fire.

""As White drew closer to Lt. Slyve, while continuing to swing the machete,"" Fortunato said in a statement. ""Lt. Slyve fired three rounds striking White in the facial area, the chest and the leg.""

Police said they know of no connection between the suspect and anyone else at the airport and did not believe he was a traveler.

The suspect entered the airport and walked down the TSA pre-line where he encountered a TSA officer who was checking boarding passes to be scanned, police said. He was challenged by the TSA officer and he allegedly pulled a can of wasp spray and sprayed the TSA officer in the face.

The suspect proceeded past that checkpoint and confronted two other TSA officers, a female and a male. The suspect sprayed the male in the face, police said.

""Within moments,"" Fortunate said in a press release, ""White pulled from his waistband a large machete and began wielding the weapon at the TSA agents as well as nearby passengers.""

A male TSA officer grabbed a piece of luggage to defend himself, then the assailant chased him through the metal detector. After approaching the assailant with her weapon drawn, Lieutenant Sylve fired three times, stopping the assailant, police said.

Flights from the affected concourse were redirected to other terminals and operations continued except at Concourse B, which was closed for the investigation.

The suspect was taken from the airport to University Hospital where he is currently undergoing surgery.

According to authorities, the TSA agent who got shot during the incident sustained a non-threatening injury to the arm.

That's because a cord blood transplant stopped it in its track, saving his life.

His older brother, Marshall wasn't so lucky.

""My son lost his eyesight. My son lost his hearing. He can't hear me. He can't see me,"" his mother, Tammy Wilson, told ABC News. ""He has seizures on a daily basis, on average six, sometimes 12 seizures a day.""

Marshall's decline and diagnosis prompted doctors to quickly diagnose Michael and give him the treatment that would save him.

As a baby, Marshall met every milestone until he was a year old in June 2010, Wilson said. But at 13 months, when Wilson was about 6 months pregnant with Michael, Marshall stopped walking. Then, he stopped crawling. Soon, he couldn't hold up his own head.

It took five months for doctors to diagnosed Marshall with Krabbe, an inherited degenerative disease that would eventually kill him, Wilson said. Doctors immediately told Wilson to test her newborn for the disease as well, and in December 2010, they learned he, too, had it.

Doctors could save Michael by giving him a cord blood transplant, providing him with the enzyme he lacked to maintain the protective coating on nerve cells called myelin. He got the transplant on Feb. 10, 2011, and the Wilsons consider it his re-birthday.

""Marshall was no longer a candidate for this transplant because he was too symptomatic,"" Wilson said. ""From July to December, with the regression he went through as fast as he did, he was no longer a candidate for lifesaving treatment.""

Had Marshall been tested as a newborn, he, too, could have been be running and playing with his brother. So Wilson is fighting to get Oregon to mandate a test for Krabbe as part of its standard newborn testing.

Similar legislation has already passed in Illinois, New Mexico, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Missouri, said Anna Grantham, a spokesman for Hunter's Hope, a foundation that helps fund Krabbe research and push newborn testing. Grantham said ten states are considering bills this legislative session.

Wilson's representative in Oregon, Rep. Jim Weidner, sponsored a bill on her behalf last legislative session in 2013, and they hope it will pass this year.

""When there's a cure for something, then we should be testing for it, so we can give a child an opportunity for a full life,"" Weidner said.

According to the Mayo Clinic, these transplants can help pre-symptomatic infants by slowing the progression of the disease, but they still experience difficulties with ""speech, walking and other motor skills.""

So far, Michael is doing well. And Wilson said she thinks 5-year-old Marshall is still aware of his surroundings, so she'll press her lips to his cheek to talk to him.

""I’m in full-blown tears because my son is communicating with me,"" Wilson said. ""Which is very rewarding and comforting to me because I knew this disease may take everything from him. ... I know in my heart and soul that he knows I'm mom. I’m thankful for the first year we had together."""

""They were pointing and laughing at her from the stands,"" says Miles Rodriguez, a basketball player at Lincoln Middle School in Wisconsin. ""It's not funny to make fun of somebody by the way they look or act.""

Without a second thought, the team walked off the court to demonstrate against those bullying Desiree.

""You have these kids that were picking on her and it came to the attention of the team, said Timothy Nieman, the school's athletic director. ""The team as a whole has something to say about it. They came out and said, 'Hey, she is here to support us. You guys need to cut it out.'""

The students then took Desiree under their wing, even naming the school gym ""D's House"" after the teen.

“She was happy that we had her side and that we had her back,” said one of the players, Scooter Terrien. “You can tell she was happy because she never took the smile off her face.”

Since catching fire, the logo ""D's House"" has been plastered onto t-shirts and other promotional material.

""People will say that kids look up to teachers,"" Nieman said. ""Well, I think in this case that many teachers are looking up to them.""

In the future, members of the Lincoln Knights basketball team said they'll keep striving to eliminate bullying in their school, no matter how hard the fight.

""This is not a one-time thing,"" said player Harice Hodges. ""You always have to stick up for kids that are bullied. It’s the right thing to do.""

ABC News reached out to Desiree Andrews via Lincoln Middle School, but she had been absent from her classes."

“Ever since [Netanyahu] came to power in 2009, he did not have any intention whatsoever to deal with the Palestinian-Israeli conflict,” said Maen Areikat, the Palestinian Liberation Organization’s representative to the United States.

“I think he is telling the world, 'Here I am. I want to show you my true skin,'” he added.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Gets Vote of Confidence

Israel Elections May Have Tipped in Benjamin Netanyahu's Favor

President Obama said the United States would re-evaluate its policies towards Israeli-Palestinian issues after Netanyahu said, the day before parliamentary elections, that he would not see a Palestinian state established if he were re-elected.

“We take him at his word when he said that it wouldn’t happen during his prime ministership,"" Obama said in an interview with The Huffington Post Saturday. ""And so, that’s why we’ve got to evaluate what other options are available to make sure that we don’t see a chaotic situation in the region.”

Netanyahu’s Likud party went on to victory, which many political observers attributed to Netanyahu's comments on a Palestinian state and other comments that were seen as driving divisions between Israeli Jews and minorities. He has walked back those statements -- most recently apologizing  to Israeli Arabs in remarks at his official residence Monday evening -- but the White House insisted the damage was done.

Areikat said the government he represents understands why Obama gave Netanyahu the benefit of the doubt until now, but that just looking at domestic Israeli politics, it was clear he was never serious about peace talks -- which have started and stopped twice since Obama and Netanyahu took office.

Netanyahu ran his campaign largely on security issues and the threat he said would befall Israel if his center-left opponents took over.

“This whole shift in Israeli politics in recent years was fundamentally based on misperceptions, false presentations, a culture of fear exported to the Israeli people about the security issues,” Areikat said. “This current government succeeded in somehow selling what it sold its own public to the rest of the world, especially the United States.”

The Israeli embassy in the United States did not respond to requests for comment on the issue.

One policy shift the Obama administration has already floated is to support, or at least not actively oppose, a United Nations Security Council resolution defining Palestinian statehood, which it had previously opposed because it believed such a move could jeopardize direct talks, which it believed were more effective.

Last week, White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Netanyahu’s comments “have consequences for actions that we take at the United Nations and other places,” although during the Huffington Post interview Obama would not say whether or not he would support such a resolution.

But the Palestinian ambassador to the U.N., Riyad Mansour, suggested that was one way the U.S. could register its disillusionment with Netanyahu.

“A United Nations Security Council resolution legislating the two-state solution would be an appropriate option to defend the two-state solution which enjoys a global consensus,” he said.

Airekat said that while supporting a U.N. resolution would be a step in the right direction, he wanted the U.S. to also urge Israel to end its occupation of the West Bank.

“Nobody knows what the United States is planning to do. We are hoping together to hear from them in the coming days about what they have in mind,” he said.

So far, the United States has only signaled that it might make changes, without actually making any yet. But long wait times are nothing new for participants in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process -- something Mansour seemed to acknowledge when he spoke generally of this new shift in U.S. policy.

“This process will likely take time,"" he said. ""However, we do hope it happens quickly.”"

The escaped prisoner, Wossen Assaye, was identified by a bus passenger who recognized him on the bus and called police, a law enforcement source told ABC News.

The suspect was arrested in Washington, D.C., by Metropolitan Police Department without incident at 25th and Pennsylvania Avenue SE, law enforcement sources added.

Assaye earlier prompted a lockdown at Inova Fairfax Hospital, in Falls Church, Virginia, less than 10 miles southwest of Washington, D.C., authorities said.

Assaye had been taken to the hospital for injuries sustained during a suicide attempt last Friday, officials said. For the first 24 hours of his hospital treatment, he was watched by Alexandria County sheriff’s deputies, and after that, responsibility for security went to security contractor Allied Protective Services.

At 3 a.m. this morning, Assaye overpowered a female security guard at the hospital and took her gun, Fairfax County Police Chief Edwin Roessler said today after Assaye was captured.

Next, Assaye confronted a male security officer, according to Bobby Mathieson of the U.S. Marshals Service. Mathieson said the male officer fired a shot but no one was hit -- though Roessler said it was unknown who fired the shot.

Assaye then escaped through a hospital stairwell, officials said. Authorities say they don't know what restraints were on him. He was wearing a hospital gown and no shoes at the time.

Police are looking for this escaped prisoner. He is wearing a hospital gown and no shoes & armed with a gun. pic.twitter.com/sMtvEYkWeL

Authorities said they did not know if the escape was pre-planned.

Assaye fled to a residential neighborhood and broke into the trunk of a 2002 silver Toyota Camry, authorities said. When the owner of the car started to drive to work, Assaye kicked his way out of the trunk and carjacked the vehicle, police said.

The driver was slightly injured during the carjacking, police said.

Around 10:30 a.m., the Camry was found abandoned. Assaye then carjacked another car and fled, police said.

The second car, a 2008 Hyundai Elantra, has also been located, police said after Assaye's capture.

Police said a weapon has been recovered.

Suspect abandoned the first stolen vehicle and has stolen a second one. We are now looking for a dark gray Hyundai Elantra w/VA: XTU-5024

A heavy police presence was reported near the hospital, and police vehicles were seen blocking the hospital’s entrances during the search for the prisoner. Hospital employees were being sent to a nearby high school, and a shuttle bus was carrying the employees to work during the lockdown, police said.

Assaye made his initial appearance in a federal courtroom in Alexandria, Virginia, this afternoon. He was charged with one count of escape from custody in addition to the charge he is already facing for armed robbery.

Assaye appeared ""heavily shackled"" and escorted by four deputy U.S. marshals, a law enforcement source said.

His next appearance will be Friday afternoon.

According to a court complaint, Assaye was accused in a string of bank robberies in eastern Virginia between October 2013 and March 20, 2015. In each situation, authorities say, the perpetrator entered the bank -- often with a cell phone to his ear -- either displayed a handgun or demand note, and verbally demanded money.

Assaye had a criminal history, with convictions for multiple burglary and robbery offenses in 1998 and 1999, and served time in prison between 2000 and May 2013, according to the complaint.

Düsseldorf prosecutor Christoph Kumpa also said that a second black box had been recovered as the probe into Andreas Lubitz's actions continues more than a week after the crash.

The officials said they had recovered a tablet from Lubitz's home that had been used between March 16 and 23, the day before the crash. Kumpa said Lubitz, 27, had also used the tablet to do research for ways to carry out suicide -- suggesting a degree of premeditation.

The Germanwings plane that departed from Barcelona crashed en route to Dusseldorf on March 24 with all 150 people on board killed on impact.

German authorities had previously said that Lubitz had also been treated by a psychotherapist because of previous suicidal tendencies and that he had deliberately flown the jetliner into a mountain.

Authorities did not find a suicide note.

Also today, French Prosecutor Brice Robin in Marseille confirmed the recovery of the black box, which was burnt. They are continuing to identify victims with the help of DNA provided by family members. The officials said they are hopeful to be able to get information from the flight data recorder despite its condition.

Robin also said they found 42 cellphones in the wreckage and that they were ""very, very damaged.""

Asked about the cellphone video that purported to show the final moments before the plane went down, Robin said, ""I don't have any information"" about it.

Germanwings CEO Olivier Wagner, speaking at a press conference in Marseille earlier this week, called the crash the ""saddest day of my life. The families are always asking me, 'Why had this happen?' I cannot give them an answer.""

Authorities have said Lubitz hid evidence of an illness from his employers, including a sick note that was found torn up inside his apartment in Dusseldorf dated from the day of the crash.

The Baltimore attorney has become the face of the movement to reform how the military handles sexual assault cases, and on Tuesday she announced a new federal lawsuit aimed at combatting the problem.

At issue for Burke and the four former military members involved in the suit is that sexual assault allegations within the military are handled entirely within the command structure.

Burke and other like-minded reform advocates believe the judicial process should be handled outside units by a process independent of the chain of command.

This latest suit filed in the Eastern District Court of Virginia alleges instances of retaliation, sexual harassment and abuse in various levels of command that Burke said ought to lead to complete removal of the members from the judicial process.

In one particular case, former Tech. Sgt. Jennifer Smith brought forward an unofficial Air Force songbook that contained dozens of sexist and violent lyrics. She said she had filed an administrative complaint over the book in 2012.

But Smith said the general assigned to address her complaint sang the sexist songs with the airmen regularly.

""These are not judges or lawyers, these are actual battlefield commanders,"" Burke said. ""They have extraordinary judicial powers despite having no legal training and in many instances having the type of personality that openly sings these incredibly sexist songs in front of their soldiers and airmen.""

The complaint alleges some of the most disturbing content is found in the songbooks of the 55th, 77th, and 79th fighter squadrons of the Air Force.

Air Force spokeswoman Capt. Brooke Brzozowske didn't comment on the lawsuit itself to ABC News, but noted that the book was from 2012, prior to the Air Force initiating a health and welfare inspections program where such materials would have been confiscated.

In the news conference though, retired Air Force Col. Don Christensen alleged the songbooks were still used by airmen to this very day.

Brzozowske said she didn't know the current status of the books, but said the Air Force had contacted the Inspectors General today to reach out to make sure the books were not still in use.

While Congress has sought to address sexual assault in the military in recent years after increased media attention and disturbing revelations in the documentary ""The Invisible War,"" in which Burke was a central figure, Smith told ABC News that the fight has turned political.

""They keep dancing around the issue, when the real remedy is just to take it out of the chain of command,"" Smith said. ""I was assaulted, but I couldn't count on my reporting it to go anywhere because of who I knew was in charge.""

Burke said that while Congress has been able to enact ""incremental steps"" to fix the inner workings of the military justice system, that is like ""building a house on a weak foundation."""

Germanwings said in a statement today that they never received a sick note for co-pilot Andreas Lubitz that the senior prosecutor in Dusseldorf announced they had found torn up in his apartment.

Prosecutor Christoph Kumpa had said earlier in the day that ""a torn-up current sick note ... valid for the day of the incident"" had been found, adding that it ""would -- according to preliminary evaluation -- support the assumption that the [pilot] had concealed his illness towards his employer and his occupational environment.""

Kumpa said the note found indicated the pilot ""was declared by a medical doctor unfit to work.""

The disclosure of torn medical documents at the co-pilot's home came shortly before Germanwings' parent company, Lufthansa, announced that it would be changing company policy to require two ""authorized persons"" remain in the cockpit at all times during the flight, in light of the finding that co-pilot Andreas Lubitz apparently stopped the captain from re-entering the cockpit and forced the plane to crash.

In addition to the findings suggesting Lubitz was hiding an illness, a search of his apartment in Dusseldorf yielded no suicide note and the city's prosecutor announced that there is no evidence that political or religious factors were involved in the crash.

Officials seized medical documents at Lubitz's home that indicated ""an existing illness and appropriate medical treatment,"" Senior State Prosecutor Ralf Herrenbrueck said in the statement, according to the Associated Press.

Torn up prescriptions and notes from doctors ""support the current preliminary assessment that the deceased hid his illness from his employer and colleagues,"" the statement said, according to the AP.

The Wall Street Journal cited a friend of Lubitz who said that he suffered from depression and actively concealed that diagnosis from his employer. ABC News has not independently confirmed this account.

Dusseldorf University Hospital confirmed Lubitz was a patient there and his last visit was two weeks before the crash. They denied that the treatment was related to depression, but they have handed over all of his medical records to German investigators.

During a news conference on Thursday, the Lufthansa CEO said that the 27-year-old co-pilot had undergone a medical examination that included a psychological evaluation before being hired in 2013 but, unlike physicals, mental evaluations are not required annually.

The Germanwings plane crashed this past Tuesday in the Alps in southern France with 150 people on board, including two babies, the airline said. French President Francois Hollande said there were ""apparently no survivors.""

Brice Robin, public prosecutor of Marseille, France, said in a news conference Thursday that Lubitz appeared to want to ""destroy the plane,"" purposefully locking the captain out of the Airbus A320's cockpit and accelerating the descent manually.

A group of 150 homeless men and women took a guided tour of the museum and gardens and received dinner in the Vatican Museum’s cafeteria. They also were invited to pray in the Sistine Chapel, where the pope made an unannounced visit.

“This is everyone’s house: it’s your house. The door is always open for all,” Francis reportedly said as he shook their hands.

The Vatican says the pontiff spent 20 minutes with the visitors, meeting each one individually. He asked them to pray for him saying, “I need prayers from people like you.""

“It was a great surprise meeting him,” said Graziella, one of the homeless visitors, to the Italian news agency ANSA. ""The pope was smiling a lot but above all I was struck by his humility. Who else would have done this? Nobody. I always go to church but I have never experienced such humanity and humility.""

The tour passed the Casa Santa Marta, where Pope Francis chose to live instead of the stately Papal apartment, and included a stop at a recently opened room in the museum that houses the pope’s historical carriages.

The invitation is just one of a string of actions taken by the pontiff to reach out to the poor. To mark his birthday in December, Pope Francis had sleeping bags distributed to the homeless in and around St. Peter’s Square. In February, the Vatican built showers and hired barbers for the homeless around the square.

And in mid-June, Francis will lunch with some of Turin’s homeless on a visit there, the Vatican announced yesterday.

Pope Francis’ outreach to the poor echo one of the central messages of his papacy. ""Do not be afraid to go and to bring Christ into every area of life, to the fringes of society, even to those who seem farthest away, most indifferent,"" Francis said in 2013.

The Vatican has called on the homeless to help distribute gospels or prayer booklets to the faithful in the square on Sundays during the Pope’s noontime prayer.

The tour and dinner was organized by the Office of Papal Charities, which regularly distributes meals to the homeless who live in Rome.

The Vatican said Francis did not want any official photos of videos taken of the event.

Officers took Kamron Taylor into custody Friday night after responding to a call of a suspicious person, police said.

When they approached Taylor, he ran, said police. They arrested him on a gun charge unrelated to his escape after police said he was caught carrying a firearm.

Police said they would charge and hold him locally before turning him over to the Kankakee County Sheriff's Department.

Taylor, 23, escaped the Jerome Combs Detention Center early Wednesday after beating a corrections officer and taking his uniform, keys and vehicle, Sheriff Tim Bukowski said in a news conference later that day. He was recently convicted and was awaiting sentencing, said police.

The uniform fooled other officers, who allowed Taylor to pass through three doors to leave the jail, Bukowski said.

Bukowski said that the staff of the detention center was recently decreased and inmates were aware of it.

""Because of the loss of some other staff members, [current staff] have been forced to work some overtime,"" he said. ""Because of that, they get tired and they start to make mistakes.""

The officer that was injured during the escape was in the intensive-care unit after the attack, but the Sheriff's Office said Thursday that his condition was improving."

""He was left outside by his breeder,"" said Brutus' rescuer Laura Aquilina. ""I don't know if it was on purpose, but it was admitted that he lost his paws because of frostbite.""

After his limbs were removed, Brutus, now 2 years old, was rescued by a good Samaritan who Aquilina said met the dog when the breeder attempted to sell him in a parking lot.

Because Brutus couldn't move around well, Aquilina, who lives in Loveland, Colorado, took Brutus to be fitted for prosthetics by OrthoPets Denver, a company that she had heard of through a fellow dog rescuer.

""He's able to walk on softer surfaces like carpeting, but on something really hard like concrete he's much more comfortable in the prosthetics,"" she told ABC News, noting that Brutus was fortunate to be relatively close to the Denver company.

""Before this, we never heard of OrthoPets. We are really grateful for them and their expertise,"" Aquilina said.

Each year, OrthoPets Denver provides prosthetics for 250 animals worldwide, according to the company.

Brutus is the second case the veterinary clinic has seen of a quadruple amputee.

""Brutus first received the prosthetics about 5 months ago,"" said OrthoPets co-founder Martin Kaufmann. ""On the medical side, part of the challenge was when dogs lose their paws, their joints are increasingly unstable. He was more susceptible to injuries and additional pain associated with those injuries.""

""The large goal that we’re accomplishing is being able to get him outdoors walking on hard surfaces. Above anything else, he has comfort,"" Kaufmann said.

With his prosthetics, Brutus is now able to walk, run and play his favorite game, tug-of-war.

""When you take him out without his prosthetics, he knows that he can't walk on certain surfaces,"" Aquilina said. ""When you put them on, he takes off. He even tries to chase squirrels in them. They give the ability to be a dog so I think he’s happy being able to do more things with them on.""

""Brutus is super sweet, ridiculously smart, and has a very forgiving nature,"" said Aquilina, who has been fostering Brutus since July 2014. ""You would think a dog like him who's been through so much wouldn't trust people, but he's a very gentle soul.""

She said she and her husband have decided to keep him and the adoption will be finalized as of next week."
1O31fYi,2015-03-17 00:00:00,An Island of Ice and Fire as Seen in a Weekend - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Travel/island-ice-fire-weekend/story?id=29695125,"It was midnight and we just returned to our hotel room in Iceland's capital of Reykjavik from a freezing venture to the outskirts of town. I started chewing on a soft piece of fried Icelandic bread as I attempted to make an international adaptor fit into a recessed wall socket. The lights suddenly went out in the room.

My eyes hadn't yet adjusted to the darkness when I felt a tooth missing in my mouth – a dental crown. Confused and searching for light, I peeled away the room's window curtains to reveal none other than the Northern Lights, painted in broad strokes across the sky in a bold and celebratory green hue recalling that of the Wildfire that destroyed fleets in “Game of Thrones.”

They had uncharacteristically followed us back into the city, dancing outside our very own hotel window. I spit out my tooth's crown. Anywhere else, it would have simply fallen out. But in Iceland, it was rather ceremoniously dethroned.

Iceland is no stranger to drama; it's known for its sagas (49 tales in all), and it has been a hot spot for filming the shows said to be inspired by them, including “Game of Thrones,” as well as box-office hits like “Interstellar,” “The Life of Walter Mitty” and “Oblivion,” just to name a few. For a country about 15 percent the size of Texas, that's no small feat.

But it's also not surprising for a place where, in even the coldest winters, you can take a warm dip in an outdoor geothermal pool, or where snow-capped volcanoes can erupt with hot lava at any moment. Here's how we spent 49 hours in the island of ice and fire:

On the heels of a redeye via IcelandAir, we took a Reykjavik Excursions bus to the city (a far less expensive option than taking a taxi) and settled into CenterHotel Arnarhvoll, a hotel we picked for its walking-distance proximity to pretty much everything in Reykjavik. After a quick nap, we stopped by Kaffitar, a bustling and quirky Portlandia-esque coffee shop where servers yell out orders in a sing-song way. We picked up some coffee and Icelandic dark rye bread for the road. You know that ""it's so hot out you can fry an egg on the sidewalk"" joke? Well, Iceland is powered entirely by geothermal energy, making it the world's largest green-energy producer; its ground gets so hot, farmers bake their bread in it – yes, even in the winter. And it's delicious.

We set out for a couple of stops along the famed Golden Circle, a 186-mile loop from Reykjavík into central Iceland and back. Among the highlights was Pingvellir National Park, which lies in a rift valley that marks the crest of the Mid-Atlantic ridge. You can actually spot the continental drift between the North American and Eurasian plates in the cracks and canyons traversing the park. We walked the icy path to the gorge, tracing the very steps the characters Arya and The Hound took while filming “Game of Thrones,” a frozen lake covered in snow and surrounding by tall black lava rock walls. Within just an about an hour drive further east from Pingvellir, water dramatically sprouts up from the ground to over 100 feet, at Geysir, and plummets down from over 100 feet, at waterfalls like Gulfoss. Traveling through the island started to feel like taking a ride on a beast with an unpredictable volcanic underbelly.

Speaking of beasts (kind of), on our way back into the city, we stopped by Fakasel, an Icelandic horse park. Icelandic horses are of human height with the temperament of puppies; they're excited to meet new people and shower them with licks. If you can imagine a real-life version of “My Little Ponies,” they would be it, down to the predator-free vacuum they live in; to keep their breed pure and the threat of outside diseases afoot, Icelandic law forbids horses from either entering or leaving the island (if they leave, they can't return).

Time for some supper back in Reykjavik. Iceland is famous for its hot dogs, made with lamb and typically served on top of crunchy tiny onion rings. Even upscale restaurants in town serve them. We opted for the hot togs at Islenki Barinn, where they serve local beer at the bar by candlelight.

Before the Northern Lights surprised us outside our hotel window, we ventured about an hour outside the city to see them. Like a lot of naturally occurring things that are beautiful, they can be unpredictable and evasive. Also known as Aurora Borealis, Northern Lights are mini storms in space, or collisions between electrically charged particles from the sun that enter the Earth's atmosphere; in extreme cases of high activity, they can cause electricity in a region to shut down and can even trigger fires. Their activity can vary by night, and being able to spot them depends not only on a high level of this activity, but also on a very dark and clear winter sky. We braved the sub-zero temps in our venture away from city lights and were rewarded with quite the display, arching from one end of the sky over us and across, like twilight rainbows, but far more dynamic, fading and resurfacing from one moment to the next in different directions and shapes – a cold sky roaring with fire.

It felt like we were still dreaming when we started heading down to Iceland's South Shore during a snowstorm. Mountains and volcanoes were sandwiched between low-hanging clouds and wind-swept snow. On our way to the southernmost town of Iceland, Vik, we stopped by Eyjafjallajökull, the snow-capped volcano that erupted in 2010, as well as a couple of icicle-bitten waterfalls, including Skogafoss, one of the largest in the country, with a width of 82 feet and a drop of 200 feet.

Arriving at Vik, we walked on Reynisfjara, a beautiful black sand beach under Reynisfjall Mountain outlined with basalt rock columns. The winds pelted at us from every direction, white snow settling on black sand, as we walked gingerly, keeping our distance from the infamous volatile beach waves that have swallowed people up. We took momentary shelter in Hálsanefeshelli, a large vaulted sea cave mid-beach, before walking back to the shore, where we spotted the iconic Reynisdrangar, a set of mid-ocean basalt sea stacks. Icelandic legend says these rock formations were actually Huldufolk, trolls who tried to drag a ship to land unsuccessfully and then turned to rock when daylight broke.

Back in Reykjavik, we walked along the city’s harbor at sunset, where we learned that, to Icelanders, Huldufolk are not merely the fodder of folklore, but are seeped so deep in the culture that they’ve influenced the design of even recent cultural landmarks like the Opera house. Icelanders believe in their existence so much that they follow elf-zoning codes, steering clear of construction that can damage the rocks where they are believed to live in. Along the harbor, we also stopped to see Solfar, the Sun Voyager, a stainless steel sculpture of a dreamboat that is said to represent unchartered territory. We finished off the evening with an excellent dinner at Fish Market, where they serve everything from smoked puffin to grilled whale. On our walk back to the hotel, we spotted jovial Icelanders spilling in and out of bars.

We were ready to let our whirlwind adventure sink in our minds as our sleep-deprived bodies soak in the milky waters of the Blue Lagoon. Stepping into the lagoon is like stepping into a warm bath, the waters calmly and immediately shielding the skin from the freezing outdoor air. We slathered our faces in the lagoon’s natural white geothermal silica mud. A thick fog of steam rose from the 100-degree light-blue waters, causing other silica-draped faces to fade in and out of view. This dynamic, combined with the simultaneous feeling of having our heads in arctic clouds and our feet on warm lava grounds, created a dream-like effect. Bobbing around in a boiling hot bath ensconced in snow-capped lava rocks, we felt the island bid us a fitting farewell, with a dance of ice and fire."
1OAoDwk,2015-03-26 00:00:00,Germanwings Co-Pilot Appeared to Want to 'Destroy the Plane': Prosecutor - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/US/germanwings-pilot-appeared-destroy-plane-prosecutor/story?id=29918529,"The co-pilot of the Germanwings plane that crashed in the French Alps this week appeared to want to ""destroy the plane,"" Brice Robin, public prosecutor of Marseille, said today.

""The intention was to destroy the plane,"" he said, later adding: ""Death was instantaneous.""

Speaking at a news conference conducted mostly in French, Robin confirmed reports about the pilot being heard on the voice recorder asking co-pilot Andreas Lubitz, a German citizen, to take over the controls, with a chair heard being moved and door heard closing.

The co-pilot, 27, took control, Robin said, and the accelerated descent was made manually.

Whatever Lubitz's motivation, Germamwings initially took exception to the prosecutor's comments, tweeting this morning, ""We are shocked by the statements from French authorities that the co-pilot deliberately crashed the aircraft.""

But at a news conference later in Cologne, Carsten Spohr, CEO of Lufthansa, which owns Germanwings, said, “We have to accept that the plane was crashed on purpose.” He added, “It seems to be true that the co-pilot denied the pilot access to the cockpit.”

He asked people not to rush to judgment, however, which he called ""speculation"" about the co-pilot's intentions, adding, ""the motivation could be of various nature.""

He stressed that the co-pilot, who had 630 hours of flying time, had undergone extensive psychological and aviation review since beginning training in 2008 and joining the company as a first officer in 2013, though his training was interrupted six years ago for an unspecified reason.

""In our worst nightmare, we could not have imagined that such a tragedy could take place at our company,"" Spohr said, speaking in German and agreeing with French authorities that terrorism was not involved.

When asked by a reporter whether this was a case of suicide, he declined to characterize it as such, saying, “I’m not a lawyer or a legal person, and I don’t want to speculate.”

He then added: “If a human takes 149 people to death with him, I will not call that suicide.”

As for the chain of events, prosecutor Robin said all had seemed normal as the pilots communicated in a ""jovial"" way for the first 20 minutes of the flight.

But later, the captain can be heard on the voice recording knocking on the door and asking over the speaker to re-enter the cockpit, but there was no response from the co-pilot, Robin said.

The co-pilot can be heard breathing until the moment of impact, Robin said, so officials believe he was alive until the crash in which all 150 people on board are presumed to have died.

Air traffic control can also be heard calling, with no response from the cockpit.

Lubitz, who lived in Montabaur, Germany, had no reason to lock the pilot out of the cabin, no reason not to respond to air traffic control and no reason to disable the plane's ability to maintain contact with other plans in the area, Robin said.

Toward the end of the descent, investigators can hear ""violent"" banging on door as the pilot tries to get in, Robin added.

Lufthansa CEO Spohr said pilots are able to enter a code to re-enter the cockpit but that the pilot inside is able to disable the system electronically. So either the captain did not enter the code or Lubitz blocked his entry, he said. ""It is a puzzle for us,"" he said.

Spohr added, however, ""We have total confidence in our pilots and co-pilots.""

The German Interior Ministry told ABC News there is no evidence that Lubitz had a connection to terror, noting that the ministry is also working closely with the Dusseldorf prosecutor, who has launched an investigation into the matter.

Editor’s note: A French prosecutor initially said Lubitz was 28 years old but a law enforcement official later determined that he was 27.

That’s a year with no hot showers, cold beers or the touch of his family. Kelly’s girlfriend Amiko Kauderer said she can’t call him, but he can call her, so will keep her cell phone close. It will be tough, but she said the reunion when he comes back will be special.

""For me it’s like the most romantic long-distance relationship ever,"" Kauderer said.

There are some amenities on the space station -- the views are out of this world, zero gravity gymnastics, and being an astronaut is still an elite job. Kelly knows that duty on the space station can mean fixing the toilet one week and being out on a spacewalk the next week.

Scott, 51, and his twin brother, retired astronaut Mark, will both be human guinea pigs. NASA will be comparing what happens to Scott’s body and brain to those of his brother Mark, while Mark is on the ground.

Mark said this will double what we know about spaceflight and the human body. ""Maybe there is a little cliff out there that you fall off with regards to the radiation, bone mass, bone density, those type of things, so, I am all in,"" Mark said.

Scott admits it will be a tough year -- and he should know. He has pulled one six-month stint on the space station already. After ""about four months, you start thinking, you know, there is a lot of stuff I miss on Earth. I feel like I have accomplished everything I need to, and I am sorta ready to go home.”

On a year-long mission, the intense yearning to go home could come later, he said, noting he hopes that yearning comes about ""two-thirds of the way into the mission.""

""I am kinda hoping it occurs then,"" Scott said.

Flight surgeon Dr. Stevan Gilmore is overseeing the research for this year in space. He knows how tough zero gravity is on the human body, and what NASA needs to know before they send humans off on a three-year round trip mission to Mars. This, he said, is an important step.

“We want to understand, is there anything that pops up between the six- and twelve-month duration so that we know if there are any large barriers out there for new missions,"" Gilmore said.

NASA really wants this to lead to a Mars mission. That’s why Mark Kelly agreed to the research.

""We need to figure out how people are going to live in space for really long periods of time, especially if we want to send somebody to Mars. We want to one day build a base on the Moon. Our experience with long-duration flight is six months,"" Mark said.

Despite all the possible dangerous side effects, the twins said they believe they are blazing a path that will take humans into space. Mark admits he has the easy job saying on earth, but noted that without taking risks, ""we don’t go anywhere, we don’t learn anything, we don’t get better at anything. So, risk-taking has always been a part of the space program and always will, but in this case there is extra risk.”

What will Scott miss when he is in space for a year? All the holidays, his children’s birthdays, and good food, he said.

“The menu of food [in space] is not as large a variety as you would like, even though the weather inside the space station is generally perfect, you miss the rain, the breeze, the change of seasons,"" Scott said."

Dusseldorf University Hospital confirmed Lubitz was a patient there and his last visit was two weeks before the crash. They denied that the treatment was related to depression, but they have handed over all of his medical records to German investigators.

During a news conference on Thursday, the Lufthansa CEO said that the 27-year-old co-pilot had undergone a medical examination that included a psychological evaluation before being hired in 2013 but, unlike physicals, mental evaluations are not required annually.

The Germanwings plane crashed this past Tuesday in the Alps in southern France with 150 people on board, including two babies, the airline said. French President Francois Hollande said there were ""apparently no survivors.""

Brice Robin, public prosecutor of Marseille, France, said in a news conference Thursday that Lubitz appeared to want to ""destroy the plane,"" purposefully locking the captain out of the Airbus A320's cockpit and accelerating the descent manually.

The Death Row Records co-founder has pleaded not guilty to his charges of alleged murder, attempted murder and hit-and-run stemming from an incident that took place at the end of January in Compton, California.

The judge in the hearing Friday also added that Knight, 49, must show that no part of the money used -- if he can afford the bail -- was illegally obtained.

Knight's attorney, Matthew Fletcher, was not happy with this decision. He cited an example that even he would be investigated if he was to bail his client out.

After the hearing, Knight collapsed, hit his head on a chair and was sent to the hospital yet again.

During the hearing, Knight's lawyer had asked for a speedier trial, but the judge set the preliminary hearing for the week of April 13. Fletcher told reporters after the hearing and Knight's collapse that the living situation for his client in jail was ""torture.""

Fletcher also claimed that on the night of the incident -- that left one man Terry Carter, 55, dead -- he was attacked by multiple gang members and chose to leave the scene. When fleeing, he hit Carter with his vehicle.

According to the judge, Knight faces a minimum of 75 years in prison for the lesser of his charges if found guilty. Prosecution had argued for the $25 million bail by bringing up Knight's history of violence and alleging he was also a flight risk."

Gardell Martin was pulled from a nearly frozen creek March 11 after going missing for approximately 20 minutes, said his mother, Rose Martin. The toddler had been playing outdoors with his older brother near their home in Mifflinburg, Pennsylvania, when he fell into the fast-moving water.

By the time a neighbor found Gardell, the boy was face-up in the water and was not responsive, his mother said.

""A couple things were in his favor,"" Rose Martin told ABC News. ""The cold water helped preserve his organs and his brain.""

A hospital official confirmed that Gardell's body temperature was a frigid 77 degrees when he arrived for care. As CPR continued, doctors worked to warm the boy up and see if his heart could get started. After 101 minutes of continuous CPR, doctors found a tentative pulse.

“In my 23 years, I have not seen an hour-and-41-minutes comeback to this degree of neurological recovery,” said Dr. Frank Maffei, a pediatric critical care doctor at Geisinger Medical Center in Danville, Pennsylvania. ""That doesn’t happen by accident. It happens because people are trained.""

Dr. Alexandre Rotta, chief of pediatric critical care medicine at UH Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital in Cleveland, said the case clearly demonstrates how, in rare cases, hypothermia can lead to a kind of ""suspended animation"" that can protect the body when the heart stops.

""Hypothermia has been known for years to slow down metabolism,"" said Rotta, who said at around 77 degrees a body needs only 30 percent of its normal oxygen intake, which can help preserve the organs.

In a normal case of cardiac arrest, a patient can have irreversible brain damage after three to five minutes of oxygen deprivation, Rotta said. However, a person who has had his or her internal temperature lowered to less than 82 degrees Fahrenheit needs just 30 percent of normal oxygen consumption, meaning doctors can have more time to resuscitate the patient before they have permanent brain or organ damage, according to Rotta.

""At 28 degrees Celsius [82 degrees Fahrenheit], [you] can safely arrest someone for 20 minutes,"" Rotta said. ""There was a saying ... that you’re not dead until you’re warm and dead.""

Rotta said children are better able to be revived in such circumstances because they will cool down faster than adults and they also have slightly better rates of being revived following cardiac arrest.

""Most likely, [Gardell] was trying to swim or trying to hold on to something. His body started to cool down and it became very cold, and then he arrested because of his hypothermia,"" said Rotta. ""It has a better prognosis.""

However, Rotta said, these cases are extremely rare and he, himself, has seen only one case of a child coming back after being found in cold water in cardiac arrest.

""These cases are out there, but it requires tremendous [luck] your way,"" he said.

Gardell's mother told ABC News the family is just happy to have the toddler back at home and ""pretty much back to normal"" after his ordeal. She said his relatives feel his survival was ""an act of God.""

""I feel like we’re trying to get back to normal life and everyone is trying to get back to normal,"" said Martin. ""He’s smothered with love. We can’t give him enough attention right now."""
1OF7Wjy,2015-03-27 00:00:00,"NYC Building Fire: 2 Unaccounted for, 22 People Injured in Explosion - ABC News",http://abcnews.go.com/US/unaccounted-nyc-building-fire/story?id=29944740,"Two people were unaccounted for after a building explosion led to a seven-alarm fire in New York City on Thursday afternoon, according to city officials

A New York Police Department official identified one of those unaccounted for as Nicholas Figueroa, 23.

No information on the second person was immediately available.

At least 22 people were injured, four critically, after the fire in Manhattan's East Village, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said this afternoon. Earlier, city officials had said 25 were injured.

Figueroa's father, Nick Figueroa, told ABC News his son went to lunch in a restaurant at the bottom of the building that caught fire. He said he has had no contact with his son since the explosion and that investigators began searching for his son Thursday evening.

Neal Figueroa, Nicholas' brother, told ABC affiliate WABC this morning outside the Harlem apartment he shares with his brother that the family knows Nicholas Figueroa was at the Sushi Park restaurant because he has a pending charge for $13.04 at the establishment. The family last heard from him just before 2 p.m. ET, he said.

""Right now, we're just worried,"" he said.

Neal Figueroa said his brother was on a second date with a female co-worker that he hadn't yet met, but who he believed was in the hospital with numerous injuries following the explosion.

The family found out Nicholas Figueroa was missing when he didn't show up to work at Bowlmor Lanes at Chelsea Piers, he said. He was expected at 5 p.m. ET.

Neal Figueroa said the family has tried to locate Nicholas Figueroa through police, investigators and 311.

Neal Figueroa told WABC he was confident in his brother, referring to his brother as ""Superman.""

""I know he's strong enough to get out of this,"" he said.

It was unclear how many people were inside the building when the fire occurred, according to the New York City Fire Department. The incident took place in a bustling area with many restaurants and pedestrians, blocks away from New York University.

The FDNY confirmed that four buildings were affected and three buildings collapsed as a result of the fire and that firefighters were still putting water on some pockets of fire Friday morning. As of early this afternoon, firefighters had not started going through the rubble, city officials said.

""Once the debris is cleared and the fire is fully extinguished, then we will do a full investigation and clean-up,"" De Blasio said, adding that the full investigation ""take days.""

""Preliminary evidence suggests a gas-related explosion,"" DeBlasio said Thursday, adding that the investigation is ongoing. He said the incident ""appears to have been caused by plumbing and gas work that occurred in 121 2nd Avenue.""

De Blasio said today that it is rare to ""see a scene of such devastation in a city like this.""

""This was 24 hours ago a vibrant, bustling street,"" De Blasio said. ""And today, people are dealing with the aftermath of this tragedy.""

""The response by all of the first responders was exceptional,"" the mayor added, noting that the fire department arrived within minutes.

De Blasio said he saw ""great acts of kindness and bravery"" on Thursday, including an off-duty firefighter who climbed up a fire escaped and looked into apartments to see if anyone was home.

The four people in critical condition include two individuals with burns to their airways and another person who was unconscious following the event, according to FDNY Commissioner Daniel Nigro.

Of the about 250 firefighters who responded to the blaze, four were transported to area hospitals, where one was in fair condition, said the fire department. The conditions of the other firefighters weren't immediately released.

Around 3:17 p.m., witnesses reported what sounded like an explosion at Sushi Park restaurant at 121 2nd Avenue, which is at the bottom of a five-story, pre-war building that houses a handful of residential units."

The suspect was identified as Richard White, 62, a taxi driver, Jefferson Parish Sheriff Newell Normand said in a press conference Friday night.

The officer fired three shots, one of which grazed a TSA agent running from White, according to John Fortunato, a public information officer for Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office. Two other TSA officers were sprayed with the wasp repellent. Two other people received minor injuries fleeing the scene.

The officer who shot White was identified by Fortunato as Lieutenant Heather Sylve, a 7 1/2 year veteran of the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office. According to a press release, White was swinging a machete at Sylve when she opened fire.

""As White drew closer to Lt. Slyve, while continuing to swing the machete,"" Fortunato said in a statement. ""Lt. Slyve fired three rounds striking White in the facial area, the chest and the leg.""

Police said they know of no connection between the suspect and anyone else at the airport and did not believe he was a traveler.

The suspect entered the airport and walked down the TSA pre-line where he encountered a TSA officer who was checking boarding passes to be scanned, police said. He was challenged by the TSA officer and he allegedly pulled a can of wasp spray and sprayed the TSA officer in the face.

The suspect proceeded past that checkpoint and confronted two other TSA officers, a female and a male. The suspect sprayed the male in the face, police said.

""Within moments,"" Fortunate said in a press release, ""White pulled from his waistband a large machete and began wielding the weapon at the TSA agents as well as nearby passengers.""

A male TSA officer grabbed a piece of luggage to defend himself, then the assailant chased him through the metal detector. After approaching the assailant with her weapon drawn, Lieutenant Sylve fired three times, stopping the assailant, police said.

Flights from the affected concourse were redirected to other terminals and operations continued except at Concourse B, which was closed for the investigation.

The suspect was taken from the airport to University Hospital where he is currently undergoing surgery.

According to authorities, the TSA agent who got shot during the incident sustained a non-threatening injury to the arm.

There was a security incident near concourse B of the airport The site has been secured We will release more info as it comes available"

The suspect, Richard White, 62, died at an area hospital yesterday after he underwent surgery for gunshot wounds, according to the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office.

He was a Jehovah's Witness, and ""refused"" certain types of medical care, Jefferson Parish Sheriff Newell Normand said at a press conference Saturday. He added that there was also a ""mental illness component.""

Authorities searched a bag the suspect dropped in the security area and found several Molotov cocktails and a search of his abandoned car revealed smoke bombs and chemical tanks, Normand said.

What the suspect intended to do with the tanks and what triggered the attack remained unknown, the sheriff said.

White entered the TSA pre-line shortly before 8 p.m. Friday, and was challenged by an agent who was checking boarding passes to be scanned, Normand said. He sprayed the agent in the face with the insecticide and continued past the checkpoint, he said.

Two more TSA agents then confronted White, according to police. He sprayed one male agent with the wasp spray before pulling a machete from his waistband and swinging it at him and a female agent.

""The male TSA officer grabbed a piece of luggage in order to defend himself,"" Normand said.

White chased the male agent through a metal detector before he was shot three times -- once in the chest, once in the leg, and once in the face -- by Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Lt. Heather Sylve, police said.

A bullet from Sylve's gun also hit the female TSA agent who was running from White. She suffered a non life-threatening injury, police said.

Normand said it did not appear that White was trying to get on a plane. A statement from the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office said his criminal history consisted of a few minor arrests.

Jeh Johnson, secretary of Homeland Security, called the attack a ""senseless act of violence,"" in a statement released Saturday.

Johnson said this incident is a ""reminder of the variety of threats we face and the important work that the men and women of the Transportation Security Administration do every day to keep millions of passengers traveling through our airports safe.""

Farah Stockman, a columnist for the Boston Globe visiting New Orleans for the weekend, said she saw people scrambling for safety as she walked out of the airport bathroom.

""Everybody was yelling and diving for cover and my husband said 'Stay where you are,'"" she recalled. ""It was just a lot of -- a lot of terrified people in an airport not knowing what was going on.""

Garret Laborde, who was trying to fly to Houston, called the incident ""instant chaos.""

""Everyone was ducking for cover. It's New Orleans. I knew they (the gunshots) were coming from the security checkpoint area,"" he said. ""I immediately ducked down. ... Then we waited.""

Shoreline, Washington, moms Jennifer Muhm and Malorie Catchpole are the co-founders of buddingSTEM, a science-themed clothing line for girls between 18 months old and 8 years old. “STEM” stands for science, technology, engineering and math.

The clothing line features dresses, leggings, t-shirts and underwear with patterns like rocket ships, trains, and dinosaurs in both blue and pink or teal and gray.

“We’re not anti-princess. We’re not anti-pink. We’re not anti-girly. We just think there needs to be more than just that offered for our girls,” Muhm, 37, told ABC News.

The moms, who don’t have backgrounds in the fashion business, say the idea for buddingSTEM was born out of their own personal experiences with their girls.

Muhm, who works in public affairs, said her daughter, now 5, really wanted to be an astronaut for Halloween in 2013. But when the costume catalogs came in the mail, her daughter noticed that only boys were shown wearing the astronaut costume.

“She looked at me and said, ‘I can’t be an astronaut. They’re only for boys,’” Muhm said.

“We talked about it because we were both frustrated about it,” Catchpole, 34, an attorney, told ABC News.

Catchpole said her own daughter, now 3, is “very into trains.” But when she and her husband wanted to buy her underpants with trains on them as a gift one Christmas, they could only find boy’s underwear. Catchpole said she bought them anyway.

“I was actually at their house on Christmas and saw the boys’ underpants under the tree, and it was that moment that it kind of clicked,” Muhm said. “I said, ‘You know what, Malorie? We should make underpants with trains on them … and then we thought why just underpants: there are no dinosaurs or rocket ships on leggings or dresses for girls.”

When they were unable to find anything like it already on the market, the moms did their research and reached out to people in their networks.

Eventually they met with a textile designer, who turned their sketches into prints for fabric, and a manufacturer.

By April 2014, Muhm and Catchpole filed their business registration for buddingSTEM. They recently surpassed their initial goal on Kickstarter, raising over $45,000 to get buddingSTEM started. The buddingSTEM clothing line will be available for sale on their website in July.

“One of the things that I’m happiest about … is what I think we’ve shown our daughters,” Catchpole said. “We’re two working moms. We don’t have a background in fashion, and we saw a need and we worked hard.”

“If there is something that is not fair -- because my daughter will say that it is not fair -- you can actually start working toward doing something about it,” said Muhm."

The Cincinnati Reds have debuted what's thought to be the first suite in Major League Baseball for nursing moms and their offspring -- the Reds fans of the future.

During the off season, the Cincinnati Reds partnered with Pampers and local homebuilder Fischer Homes to create the suite.

The decision was made after Reds Chief Operating Officer Phil Castellini was informed by the Great American Ball Park operations staff that an increasing number of moms were requesting a quiet and private place to feed their babies while at a Reds game.

The suite features gliders, changing station, a kitchenette with a sink, ice and refrigerator, lockers for storing items and, most importantly, a flat-screen TV so mom doesn't miss a home run. It's located on the Suite Level near the Champions Club elevators.

The suite will be ready to welcome tiny fans and moms on April 6 to coincide with Opening Day."
1OZBQ27,2015-04-01 00:00:00,Religious Freedom: The Difference Between Indiana's Law and All the Others - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/religious-freedom-difference-indianas-law/story?id=30019729,"Gov. Mike Pence and other supporters of Indiana’s “Religious Freedom Restoration Act” have made a simple point in defense of their law -- that a slew of other states, plus the federal government, have the same law on the books and that Barack Obama as a state senator voted for it in Illinois.

In Arkansas, meanwhile, Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson said he would not sign his state's ""Religious Freedom Restoration Act"" until the legislature changed it to more closely mirror the federal law.

So what’s the difference between all the rest of the laws -- on the federal books and in 19 other states -- and the two more recent, similar bills in Indiana and Arkansas?

Opponents and observers make a few major cases for why these two new laws are different from the rest.

1. INDIANA’S LAW APPLIES TO COMPANIES; OTHERS DON’T

“This bill is substantively different,” said Adam Talbot, spokesman for Human Rights Campaign (HRC), the D.C.-based gay rights group. “It is the broadest and most dangerous legislation of its kind.”

The main difference, gay-rights advocates say, is this: Indiana’s law expressly applies to corporations.

Into the weeds we go: The federal law signed by President Bill Clinton, and the similar Religious Freedom Restoration Acts (RFRAs) in 19 other states, do not say they apply to corporations, according to gay-rights advocates. Instead, they apply to people.

The laws say the government has to prove a higher standard of government interest in applying laws that may infringe on a person’s free exercise of their religion. In Indiana, SB 101 also included “corporations” in the list of entities that can sue.

After the Supreme Court ruled in its Hobby Lobby decision that “closely held” corporations can act on religious beliefs, it’s unclear whether other RFRA laws about individuals now also apply to corporations. But in Indiana, that definition has been expanded beyond the narrower definition in Hobby Lobby to include all corporations and associations.

""We want certainty under this law,"" said Travis Weber, director of the Center for Religious Liberty at the socially conservative Family Research Council, explaining why supporters of the bill want that corporate application included. ""We want this to be resolved in our law, so we're going to specifically define 'person' as businesses.""

Of the 19 states with similar laws, only Indiana's and South Carolina's statedly apply to corporations, according to a quick ABC review of all the laws.

2. IN SOME OTHER STATES, NONDISCRIMINATION LAWS TRUMP ‘RELIGIOUS FREEDOM’ LAWS

""If there is a nondiscrimination law” already on the books, says Lambda Legal National Law and Policy Director Jenny Pizer, “that law should be enforceable and enforced notwithstanding any religious claim.”

Pizer says her organization, a pro-gay-rights advocacy and legal-defense group, has found that nondiscrimination laws typically trump RFRA laws in court.

But Indiana has no statewide law barring discrimination based on sexual orientation, and only a handful of its counties have nondiscrimination laws at the local level. According to Pizer, that means there’s no protection from discrimination by companies—where in some other states, there is.

Four states, among the 20 that have RFRA laws, also have statewide laws that protect from sexual-orientation discrimination, per the Human Rights Campaign. In other states, pro-gay-rights legal advocates have sought to get courts to interpret sex-discrimination laws as applying to cases involving sexual orientation, but that's not always a lock.

""We haven't seen that play out in the context of sexual orientation nondiscrimination,"" said Weber. ""It has not been played out at a definitive level yet.""

Anti-discrimination lawsuits are often interlaced with other constitutional rights, so it's tough to say definitively whether wedding vendors are allowed to deny services to gay couples, for instance, in other states that don't have statewide anti-LGBT-discrimination statutes.

3. THE POLITICAL CONTEXT IS DIFFERENT, AND SO ARE THE POLICY AIMS

Indiana’s top two Republican legislators denied on Monday that SB 101 was a consolation prize for social conservatives after a failed effort to ban gay marriage in the state. They also said it wasn’t intended to have anything to do with denying services to gays and lesbians.

The other side sees things differently, but it’s clear that the context was different when Bill Clinton signed the federal bill—proposed by then-congressman Chuck Schumer, now a longtime Democratic senator from New York—into law in 1993.

The 1993 law is seen as a response to a 1989 Supreme Court ruling, Employment Division v. Smith, against two Native American drug-rehab counselors who had taken peyote, defending that action by saying it was in keeping with their religion.

That ruling, Pizer said, led to a liberal-supported push to for a “religious freedom” law that would protect the exercise of minority religions. The focus was not Christianity, necessarily.

“The general idea on the left was, in order to have equal concern and for people of minority faiths to be able to live in ways consistent with their beliefs,” Pizer said, U.S. laws needed “to have a heightened test that challenges religious-neutral law when they’re applied against people of minority faiths.”

In a later Supreme Court case, that federal law was ruled not to apply in state courts, so states began passing laws of their own.

The gay-rights movement was smaller in those days, and gay marriage was less common and not legally recognized, so the idea of preventing Christian bakers from having to serve cakes at gay weddings wasn’t really on the radar.

""The president himself has said that his views on this have evolved,"" said Ted Ruger, dean of the University of Pennsylvania Law School, pointing out how dramatically the politics and policies surrounding gay marriage has evolved over the last 10 to 15 years.

""The issue of the wedding photographer, or the wedding-cake maker, was just not an issue until the last five years, so that's the fundamental difference,"" Ruger said.

In other words, the laws were originally passed for a different policy reason, amid a much different political context.

4. THE INDIANA LAW APPLIES TO PRIVATE DISPUTES

In declining to sign his state's Religious Freedom Restoration Act, Hutchinson pointed out that the bill differed from federal law in that it applied to private disputes, not just governmental action.

Indiana's law is the same way. While other state's RFRA laws make it more difficult for the government to enforce laws when those laws incidentally infringe on religious beliefs, Indiana's applies to disputes between people, or between people and businesses.

Gay-rights advocates make that point, raising the idea that for this reason, Indiana's law more directly applies in cases where a private company denies services to a private individual.

A clause in Indiana's SB 101 states that the law applies ""regardless of whether the state or any other governmental entity is a party to the proceeding""--in other words, it could apply in private, civil suits.

1OZh3M3,2015-04-08 00:00:00,‘National Emergency’: US to Slap Sanctions on Hackers - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/International/national-emergency-us-slap-sanctions-hackers/story?id=30045263,"Cyber-attacks against the U.S. have become so bad that President Obama today declared it a “national emergency” and announced the first ever sanctions program designed specifically to go after foreign hackers.

In an executive order signed today and released by the White House, Obama said the “the increasing prevalence and severity of malicious cyber-enabled activities originating from, or directed by persons located, in whole or in substantial part, outside the United States constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.”

The order calls for a sanctions program not unlike those used in counter-proliferation or counter-terrorism programs that can target “individuals or entities that engage in significant malicious cyber-enabled activities” that harm the U.S. – including attacks on critical infrastructure, denial of service attacks or cyber espionage, according to the White House.

“This new executive order is specifically designed to be used to go after the most significant malicious cyber actors we face,” Lisa Monaco, Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism, wrote on the White House website. “It is not a tool that we will use every day.”

Some cyber security experts have long lobbied for sanctions to be added to America’s tools to counter prolific cyber-attacks –- in addition to public condemnation and the filing of criminal charges. As Michael Daniel, Special Assistant to the President and Cybersecurity Coordinator told reporters today, the sanctions program is meant to ""fill a gap"" and reach malicious actors who are ""difficult for diplomatic and law enforcement tools to reach.""

In January Obama did use sanctions in response to a cyber-attack for the first time, according to U.S. officials at the time, but that one specifically targeted North Korea for its alleged hacking of Sony Pictures Entertainment – an accusation North Korea denied. The new executive order would broaden the U.S.’s ability to freeze hackers’ assets virtually anywhere.

The Sony hack, Daniel said, ""highlighted the need"" for the executive order.

The executive order also allows the U.S. to go after those working behind the scenes, not just the people with their ""fingers on the keyboard,"" Daniel noted.

Dmitri Alperovitch, co-founder and CTO of the cyber security firm Crowdstrike, said on Twitter the new program was a “very big deal.”

“Today the White House is making yet another huge leap forward in the effort to raise the cost to our cyber adversaries and establish a more effective deterrent framework to punish actors engaged in serious intentional destructive or disruptive attacks that present a threat to national or economic security, as well as anyone engaged in economic espionage for commercial benefit or theft of financial information on a massive scale,” Alperovitch wrote on the company’s blog."

Düsseldorf prosecutor Christoph Kumpa also said that a second black box had been recovered as the probe into Andreas Lubitz's actions continues more than a week after the crash.

The officials said they had recovered a tablet from Lubitz's home that had been used between March 16 and 23, the day before the crash. Kumpa said Lubitz, 27, had also used the tablet to do research for ways to carry out suicide -- suggesting a degree of premeditation.

The Germanwings plane that departed from Barcelona crashed en route to Dusseldorf on March 24 with all 150 people on board killed on impact.

German authorities had previously said that Lubitz had also been treated by a psychotherapist because of previous suicidal tendencies and that he had deliberately flown the jetliner into a mountain.

Authorities did not find a suicide note.

Also today, French Prosecutor Brice Robin in Marseille confirmed the recovery of the black box, which was burnt. They are continuing to identify victims with the help of DNA provided by family members. The officials said they are hopeful to be able to get information from the flight data recorder despite its condition.

Robin also said they found 42 cellphones in the wreckage and that they were ""very, very damaged.""

Asked about the cellphone video that purported to show the final moments before the plane went down, Robin said, ""I don't have any information"" about it.

Germanwings CEO Olivier Wagner, speaking at a press conference in Marseille earlier this week, called the crash the ""saddest day of my life. The families are always asking me, 'Why had this happen?' I cannot give them an answer.""

Authorities have said Lubitz hid evidence of an illness from his employers, including a sick note that was found torn up inside his apartment in Dusseldorf dated from the day of the crash.

Francis traveled to Rebibbia Prison today to celebrate the Mass of Our Lord’s Supper with inmates. During the liturgy, he washed the feet of 12 inmates there, reported Vatican Radio.

Holy Thursday, also known as Maundy or Great Thursday, is the traditional celebration of Jesus’ last super with his apostles as told in the Gospels of the New Testament. It comes during the church’s holiest week of the year, between Palm Sunday and Easter.

According to the Gospel of John, Jesus washed his apostles’ feet at the Last Super (13: 2-17).

Last year, the pope washed feet at a mass held a rehabilitation facility for the elderly and those with disabilities. The year prior, Francis performed the ritual at juvenile detention center. Francis broke with tradition there, washing the feet of women instead of just men.

On his first Holy Thursday as pope in 2013, Francis encouraged priests not to be just managers, but to go to the ""’outskirts’ where there is suffering, bloodshed, blindness that longs for sight.”

Pope Francis will celebrate Good Friday by leading thousands in the Stations of the Cross at the Colosseum in a tradition that dates back to the 18th century."

""My husband bought it for me for Mother's Day and it was a joke because he said, 'Are you ever going to use it,'"" Temple told ABC News of the sewing machine.

Temple dusted off the sewing machine and put it to use in 2008 when her two daughters began asking her for a specific type of clothes.

""My daughters were five years apart and they wanted to match,"" she said. ""I couldn't find anything in the market.""

Temple began making dresses not just for daughters but for others too. She began to sell the clothes and her clothing company, Lolly Wolly Doodle, was born.

The clothing line became a community, Temple says, through Lolly Wolly Doodle's Facebook page, where Temple posted photos of the clothes and encouraged customers to contribute their experiences.

""We didn't create a business. We created a community first,"" Temple said. ""These moms talked together and they shared their stories and their pictures of their children wearing the Lolly Wolly Doodle clothes.""

""Everything else just grew so organically and so natural that we weren't trying,"" she added. ""It literally just happened.""

Lolly Wolly Doodle's Facebook page now has over one million likes and the company today brings in over $10 million annually.

It is also one of the top employers in Temple's hometown of Lexington, where she moved the line into a local factory after it grew out of her own garage. In the process, Temple created jobs and careers for many in her small town.

""To know that I was blessed with the opportunity to give back and for people to be able to save their homes, it was just giving someone an opportunity to work and to earn it,"" Temple said. ""It was pretty awesome.""

The way Temple built the Lolly Wolly Doodle customer base on Facebook makes her part of a growing number of people turning to social media to embark on their dream.

""People who are interested in growing a big audience, I think, have to pay attention to the social element of social media,"" Rob Fishman, co-founder of Niche,an online professional network for social media creators, told ABC News. ""It's about engaging other people in the community but also having a bi-directional conversation with your fans and followers.""

Temple says she has three tips for using social media to help your company grow:

1. Know your customers and adapt your social media plan to what they are already doing.

2. Be true to your brand.

3. Do not be afraid to experiment and keep trying new things."

The 37-year-old sailor embarked on a fishing trip on Jan. 23. But after his ship, “The Angel,” capsized, Jordan drifted further and further from the shoreline, eventually being rescued 200 miles off of North Carolina’s coast. He was missing for 66 days, but speaking to ABC News following his rescue, he said the journey felt more like 100 days. His captain’s log was lost in the water, along with his books, rice and most of his supplies.

“My boat got flipped and did a 180 on me while I was sleeping at night, and I was flying through the air and somersaulting and all my junk and all my equipment, all my GPS devices and everything, even my stove dislodged and it was all flying with me, all rolling around,” he said.

Jordan said he suffered a broken collarbone when his boat flipped over.

He survived on gumption, problem-solving and pancakes -- two or three each day, flour fried in oil. Jordan was able to capture rainwater, too -- when it rains in the ocean, the rainwater tastes like coconut milk, he said. He also used his laundry to trap fish, which proved to be more successful than his net.

“Every ounce of energy, there was food. And I was limited on food,” he told ABC News.

Jordan credits his faith with helping through the ordeal. He read his Bible during his 66-day journey and regularly prayed. Jordan said he wasn’t as concerned about his own well-being as he was about his family and friends.

“I was worried about them more than anything else,” he said. ""Their poor hurt feelings, if I’m ever going to show up again or not, not knowing if I abandoned them, that’s really worrying.""

Jordan’s parents reported him missing on Jan. 29, but after 10 days of searches with no sign of Jordan or the ship, the case was suspended.

As the days passed and his supplies dwindled, Jordan floated on until Thursday, when people aboard a German-flagged ship, Houston Express, spotted him floating on the damaged boat’s hull and contacted the Coast Guard in Portsmouth, Virginia. The ship took him aboard, and he was later airlifted by a Jayhawk helicopter, treated at a hospital for dehydration and released.

Jordan reunited with his father Frank Thursday in a tearful hug.

Jordan said his journey has given him perspective. He’d like to have children someday. Maybe he’ll write a book. The one thing he really wanted after 66 days at sea?

“Organic ice cream,” he said."

Following the longest outage in the history of the decade-old website, a slimmed down version of The Pirate Bay came back online over the weekend along with a new logo: A Phoenix rising from the flames.

The new iteration of The Pirate Bay is a much smaller and tightly run ship, stripping out many of the former administrators and moderators, who are now revolting against the decision to let the site run without support.

One of The Pirate Bay's former administrators, identified as WTC-SWE, told TorrentFreak that a decision maker at the site thinks it ""can be run without any staff at all and at the same time keeping up with fakes, internal issues etc.""

He said many of the people who dedicated themselves to The Pirate Bay are now preparing to start their own site -- and are warning users of the re-launched Pirate Bay to watch out for potential malware threats, since the site won't be as closely monitored by a dedicated staff.

The Pirate Bay had been hit with raids in the past, with the website's administrators staging a high-tech mutiny to bring the site back to its operational capacity in just a number of days.

The raid last year marked the first time in a while the site had been knocked offline instead of being blocked by Internet service providers in various countries.

Swedish police said they raided The Pirate Bay's servers after being prompted by a complaint by the Rights Alliance, a group targeting cyber crime.

Founded in 2003 by a group of Swedish hacktivists seeking to build a library of files to share, the site had humble beginnings on a server based in Mexico and moving a few months later to a laptop in Sweden.

At is peak, an estimated 50 million people used The Pirate Bay each day to download music and movies.

The site's core group, Gottfrid Svartholm Warg, Peter Sunde, Fredrik Neij and Carl Lundstrom were tried and convicted on copyright infringement charges in Sweden and have since distanced themselves from the site.

Each was sentenced to one year in jail and ordered to pay millions of dollars of damages, which was to be dispersed to various entertainment companies. The group appealed and had their sentences shortened.

Lundstrom served his sentence. Warg was arrested in Cambodia in 2012. Authorities caught up with Sunde, who was living openly in Sweden, in June of this year. Neij was arrested last year while trying to enter Thailand, marking four years since his conviction.

The site's leadership has switched to a nonprofit organization registered in the Seychelles, according to its ""about"" page last year. With the relaunched site, the about page was not operational and did not provide any updated information."
1ty8znG,2015-01-31 00:00:00,Super Bowl 2015: The 10 Best All-Time Commercials - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Business/super-bowl-10-best-time-commercials/story?id=28524086,"The Super Bowl is a high-stakes affair for advertisers, with the cost of a 30-second commercial topping $4.5 million this year.

But can you remember your favorite Super Bowl ads of the past?

Tim Nudd, creative editor at Adweek, helped ABC News put together his list of top Super Bowl commercials. Tell us which ones you remember and if there are others that are your favorites in the comments section below.

1. Coca-Cola ""Mean Joe Green"" (1979)

Nudd called this ""one of the most-beloved Super Bowl commercials ever."" It featured a kid melting Mean Joe's heart with a bottle of Coke.

Why it worked: Few ads ever reach this level of heartfelt Americana. Perhaps the most perfect Coca-Cola ad ever made.

2. Apple ""1984"" (1984)

Nudd said, ""The most famous commercial ever made -- the ad to change all ads, particularly Super Bowl commercials. This dark, poetic, audacious spot turned the Super Bowl into the advertising showcase it is today.""

Why it worked: Spellbinding visuals and a great, rebellious narrative.

3. McDonald's ""The Showdown"" (1993)

Michael Jordan and Larry Bird compete for a Big Mac and fries by holding an increasingly absurd shooting contest in this classic commercial.

Why it worked: Two lovable guys, a great rivalry, and a flat-out fun concept.

4. Budweiser ""Frogs"" (1995)

Bud. Weis. Er. This silly, yet infectious, campaign launched during the Super Bowl would continue for years after, Nudd said.

Why it worked: The Super Bowl never met any talking animals it didn't love.

5. Monster.com ""When I Grow Up"" (1999)

In this ad, kids talk solemnly about wanting to be exploited and marginalized in the workforce as adults in this memorable Monster spot.

Why it worked: A great idea, great writing and some great performances by the stone-faced kids.

6. E*Trade ""Monkey"" (2000)

A monkey dances on a bucket in a garage for 30 seconds. ""Well, we just wasted $2 million,"" says the on-screen text. ""What are you doing with your money?""

Why it worked: It was sophisticated and meta -- and, more importantly, had people talking the next day.

7. Budweiser ""Respect"" (2002)

The Budweiser Clydesdales genuflect in the direction of Ground Zero in the first Super Bowl after 9/11.

Why it worked: America wanted a brave marketer to step up and honor 9/11 in a suitably respectful way and Bud did that.

8. Reebok ""Terry Tate"" (2003)

Terry Tate, a linebacker, doled out pain to office workers who are not obeying office policies in this comically violent, slapstick campaign.

Why it worked: Comic violence can be hilarious, and this ad got the timing just right.

9. Google ""Parisian Love"" (2010)

This beautiful, poignant ad told a love story entirely through visuals of someone searching Google for things related to a significant other, Nudd said.

Why it worked: It was surprising and heartfelt, and the pacing was just perfect.

10. Volkswagen ""The Force"" (2011)

The most-watched Super Bowl ad ever made (the online version has 61 million views), it told the story of a pint-size Darth Vader trying to exert his Force on household objects. But only his dad's VW in the driveway roars to life in response (thanks to the remote start feature).

Why it worked: It was cute and fun, yet grand, and had the valuable built-in Star Wars equity. One of the most perfectly-constructed Super Bowl ads ever."
1u2Xo6B,2015-02-04 00:00:00,Net Neutrality: FCC Chairman Supports Strongest Ever Open Internet Rules - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/net-neutrality-fcc-considers-internet-belongs/story?id=28691926,"The Internet belongs to the people.

That's the message Federal Communications Commission Tom Wheeler sent today when he announced the strongest ever open Internet protections, which reclassify Internet Service Providers as common carriers and impose utility-style regulations.

It’s time to put in place rules to preserve the #OpenInternet that has become an indispensable part of our daily lives. #TitleII

“The Internet must be fast, fair and open,” Wheeler wrote in a Wired article today. “That is the message I've heard from consumers and innovators across this nation. That is the principle that has enabled the Internet to become an unprecedented platform for innovation and human expression.""

Wheeler asked his fellow commissioners to join him in approving the proposal at the group's next meeting on Feb. 26.

There's been plenty of talk over the past year about net neutrality, also known as an open Internet. Wheeler's proposal will still have to be put to a vote. Here's a quick breakdown of what's at stake.

Cable Companies

While many Internet service providers say they're committed to a free Internet, what they want from the FCC is more leeway for how they package and sell various Internet plans. Activists have rallied against the idea over the fear it could create toll roads on the so-called ""information superhighway.""

Michael Powell, president and CEO of the National Cable and Telecommunications Association and the former chairman of the FCC, has previously said that over regulation will not foster an even more open Internet.

What It Means for Consumers

Classifying the consumer broadband service as a public utility under Title II of the 1934 Communications Act would help control what consumers are charged and their access to Internet service, which would be deemed something critical to society.

In everyday terms, think of it this way: There won't be any uneven service so everyone can stream their Netflix queue more or less at the same speeds. Supporters of net neutrality have also said that without regulation, a greater socio-economic digital divide could develop, creating a class of information ""haves"" and ""have nots.""

The President Weighs In

Since the FCC is an independent body, President Obama has no direct oversight, however it didn't stop the commander-in-chief from weighing in on the matter of net neutrality last year.

Among the four basic points of the president's plan are no blocking websites for certain users, no throttling (creating a fast and slow lane), more transparency between consumers and Internet service providers and no paid prioritization to move to the front of the line."

Kyle Kraska, the sports anchor at KFMB-TV, was shot as he was backing his Mercedes out of his driveway in the Scripps Ranch neighborhood shortly after 3 p.m., San Diego Police Department spokesman Officer Mike Tortorella said.

Photos from the scene show a Mercedes half out of the driveway, with the rear window glass broken.

Mike Montana, 54, a suspect in the shooting, surrendered to police hours later following a SWAT standoff. Montana was seen leaving the scene in a white minivan with ""Superior Painting"" on the side, police said.

San Diego police Lt. Scott Wahl told ABC affiliate KGTV in San Diego that he could provide no details on what relationship there might be between Montana and Kraska.

Kraska underwent surgery and is expected to survive.

There's no need to press play more than once. The looping video feature could be a huge asset to advertisers looking to reach Instagram's dedicated base of 300 million monthly users.

You know Instagram for photos, but the update from the Facebook-owned app makes it clear they want to be a go-to spot for video too.

Instagram first made the foray into video nearly two years ago by allowing users to post 15-second clips. Last year, Instagram also rolled out a separate product allowing users to make hyperlapse videos.

Even still, photos make up the bulk of what is shared on the service."

His reaction is priceless. Here's to hoping they went out after the game and grabbed dinner to catch up."

The bizarre case, which started with alleged fraud involving hay in Colorado, led investigators to a sailboat that had run aground in Texas and, eventually, to a tipoff by a U.S. tourist in the Bahamas.

Donald and Karlien Winberg were charged last year with 15 counts, each relating to an alleged wire fraud scheme officials said they ran in Colorado that involved selling hay and corn that was not theirs to unload, authorities said.

They were indicted in April 2014 and entered a not guilty plea before violating their bond conditions in October by not reporting to probation and not reporting to the court for trial, their former attorney and federal authorities confirmed to ABC News today.

During the ensuing investigation, authorities said they traced them to a sailboat shipwreck in Galveston Bay, Texas. At some point after they stopped appearing in court in Colorado in October, they had purchased the sailboat in Texas, authorities say.

A federal official told ABC News that the couple ran the boat aground and ""had to walk back to shore with their money"" and their seven children. Because the ship was stuck on a remote sandbar, they were able to avoid the authorities who only later linked them to the ditched boat after it was found.

The Winbergs then bought another boat and made their way to the Bahamas, authorities say.

Authorities were only alerted to the fugitives this week after some Americans, whom the federal official would only identify as being from the southern United States, recognized the couple in connection to the wire fraud case and alerted Bahamian police, officials said.

The police asked for their identification and, when the couple refused to give them any, they were taken into custody where authorities were able to determine that they were wanted in Colorado, officials said.

Bahamain officials voluntarily deported the family back to the United States and they were taken into FBI custody as soon as they stepped off the plane in Miami Thursday, authorities said.

Donald Winberg, 43, and Karlien Winberg, 33, were both scheduled to appear at a hearing in Miami this morning and they are expected to be sent by the court to Colorado to face charges, though no timeline has been set, authorities said.

Authorities say social services in Florida has taken custody of the seven children, and their ages have not been released."

ABC confirmed that the talk show host, who returned to the program last fall after a seven-year hiatus, will move on after next week to focus on her family.

""Rosie is an immensely talented star who comes in each and every morning brimming with ideas, excitement and passion for the show. When she told us that she wanted to exit 'The View,' we respected and understood her desire to put her well-being and her family first,"" a spokesperson for the network said in a statement. ""We’re delighted she’s still part of the ABC family with upcoming guest appearances on 'The Fosters.' And we know she’ll return to 'The View' often with her unique point of view and updates on her work and her family.""

Cindi Berger, O'Donnell's personal publicist, confirmed to the New York Post's Page Six that the talk show host, 52, is also splitting from her wife of more than two years, Michelle Rounds.

""I can confirm that Rosie and her wife Michelle split in November,"" she told the newspaper. ""Rosie has teens and an infant at home that need her attention. This has been a very stressful situation. She is putting her personal health and family first. ABC has been wonderfully understanding and supportive of her personal decision to leave 'The View.' Next week will be her last.""

O'Donnell and Rounds, her second wife, adopted a baby daughter together in 2013. O'Donnell also has four older children."

Greste left Cairo with his brother on a flight bound for Cyprus, airport authorities told ABC News. They are expected to continue on to Australia.

“We’re ecstatic that Peter has been released and we now ask if the world could respect his privacy, to give him time to appreciate his freedom before he faces the media,"" read a statement from Greste's brother Andrew.

“We’re pleased for Peter and his family that they are to be reunited,"" Mostefa Souag, acting director general of al-Jazeera, said in a statement. ""It has been an incredible and unjustifiable ordeal for them, and they have coped with incredible dignity. Peter’s integrity is not just intact, but has been further enhanced by the fortitude and sacrifice he has shown for his profession of informing the public.""

An Egyptian official told Agence France-Presse that it was a ""presidential decision to deport Peter Greste to Australia.""

The Australian national was jailed for exactly 400 days after being arrested on December 29, 2013. Two other al-Jazeera employees - Mohamed Fahmy, a dual-Canadian citizen, and Baher Mohamad, an Egyptian cameraman - remain behind bars in Egypt.

The Interior Ministry did not provide additional details on reports that Fahmy's release will follow Greste’s.

All three have consistently denied charges they faced, which included spreading false news and collaborating with the Muslim Brotherhood, and maintain they were working as journalists.

“We will not rest until Baher and Mohamed also regain their freedom,"" Souag said. ""The Egyptian authorities have it in their power to finish this properly today, and that is exactly what they must do.”

Greste and Fahmy were handed seven-year sentences, while Mohamad received an additional three years for a bullet found in his possession, which he had picked up at a protest site, according to al-Jazeera.

On January 1, 2015, Egypt's Court of Cassation accepted a retrial, but the three journalists did not appear at the hearing and were not granted bail.

The imprisonment has provoked criticism from press freedom advocates around the world and sparked the online campaign #FreeAJStaff.

The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has helped lead the charge to free the journalists and repeatedly called on President Abdel-Fattah el-Sisi to free all three immediately. According to CPJ, more than 65 journalists have been detained since former President Mohamed Morsi was ousted in July of 2013."

""Too blessed to be stressed"" reads the 26-year old's Twitter tagline along with the Bible verse John 3:30: ""He must become greater; I must become less.""

He said he became a Christian when Jesus visited him in a dream when he was a teen.

Born in Cincinnati, Ohio, he was raised in Richmond, Virginia. His father was a lawyer, a former Dartmouth football and baseball player and the son of a Norfolk State University president. Harrison Wilson III, who died June 9, 2010, from complications related to diabetes at age 55, encouraged his son to play both football and baseball.

""Of course, Russell did play both sports. The Colorado Rockies drafted him the day before his father died, and he was pulling in six figures during minor league stints when he wasn’t in-season as N.C. State’s quarterback,"" according to Sports Illustrated.

He played football and baseball at North Carolina State University before transferring to University of Wisconsin-Madison. He was already engaged for five months to his high school sweetheart Ashton Meem, with whom he had a long distance relationship while she attended the University of Georgia.

""He was a god in Madison, but he didn't handle it like a college kid,” said former Wisconsin teammate Aaron Henry. “Once he started having a little bit of success you found out if God was real or not for him. Girls coming at him at 100 mph. I was with him one night and I watched him pushing girls away. Any other person would’ve taken that and ran with it.”

Life moves quickly for Wilson. He married in January 2012, and three months later he was selected in the third round of the NFL draft.

Last year, months after winning the Super Bowl, he quietly filed for divorce from his wife of two years, saying, ""I have made the difficult decision to file for divorce.""

These days, Wilson talks and Tweet about his Christian faith, pretty much any opportunity he has.

My heart yearns for You!!

He was with his wife and five children.

""We are grateful for all the thoughts and prayers, and appreciate the continued respect for our privacy as arrangements are made available to the public. Thank you,"" Smith's family said in the statement.

Smith had health issues in recent years, with the family saying in 2010 he had a condition that was causing him to lose memory. He had kept a lower profile during that time, with his wife, Linnea, accepting the Presidential Medal of Freedom on his behalf from President Barack Obama in November 2013.

Smith coached the Tar Heels from 1961 to 1997, going 879-254 and retiring as the winningest coach in college basketball history. North Carolina won NCAA championships in 1982 and 1993 and reached the Final Four 11 times under Smith.

""It's such a great loss for North Carolina -- our state, the University, of course the Tar Heel basketball program, but really the entire basketball world,"" said current Tar Heels coach Roy Williams, who spent 10 years as an assistant under Smith. ""We lost one of our greatest ambassadors for college basketball for the way in which a program should be run. We lost a man of the highest integrity who did so many things off the court to help make the world a better place to live in.

""He set the standard for loyalty and concern for every one of his players, not just the games won or lost.""

Smith coached Hall of Fame players  Michael Jordan,  James Worthy, Bob McAdoo and Billy Cunningham, won 13 Atlantic Coast Conference tournament titles and coached the U.S. Olympic team to the gold medal in 1976.

""He was the greatest there ever was on the court but far, far better off the court with people,"" Williams said. ""His concern for people will be the legacy I will remember most.

""He was a mentor to so many people; he was my mentor. He gave me a chance but, more importantly, he shared with me his knowledge, which is the greatest gift you can give someone.""

Several prominent basketball figures either played or coached under Smith, including Larry Brown, George Karl, Mitch Kupchak and Williams, who also has guided the Tar Heels to two national championships.

""I'm 64 years old and everything I do with our basketball program and the way I deal with the University is driven by my desire to make Coach Smith proud,"" Williams said. ""When I came back to Carolina, the driving force was to make him proud and I still think that today.

""I'd like to say on behalf of all our players and coaches, past and present, that Dean Smith was the perfect picture of what a college basketball coach should have been. We love him and we will miss him.""

The Associated Press contributed to this report."
1uZQ7VO,2015-01-28 00:00:00,Bodies of Missing Couple Found in Craigslist Car Case Identified; Suspect Charged With Murder - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/US/bodies-vehicle-found-georgia-case-missing-craigslist-car/story?id=28526184,"A suspect was charged with murder today after authorities positively identified the bodies of a Georgia couple who vanished last week while going to meet someone to buy a vintage car they found on Craigslist.

Bud Runion, 69, and his wife, June, 66, disappeared Thursday, authorities said. The pair had posted an ad seeking to buy a vintage 1966 Ford Mustang convertible. Relatives said the Mustang was the couple’s dream car, one they’d wanted to buy since they were married decades ago.

The suspect, Ronnie “Jay” Towns, 28, the owner of the phone that last communicated with the Runions' phone, turned himself in yesterday and was charged with murder and robbery today, the Telfair County Sheriff's office said. Towns was initially charged with giving false statements and criminal attempt to commit theft by deception.

Steverson said Towns had little or no criminal history.

The couple, after finding what they believed was a seller, reportedly set out on a 180-mile road trip from Marietta, Georgia, to McRae, Georgia. The Runions haven't been heard from since, and never showed up to babysit their grandchildren Friday.

The Runion family set up a Facebook page -- “Find Bud and June Runion” -- and it has about 100,000 supporters.

But yesterday, the page acknowledged the sheriff's discoveries of the vehicle and bodies, and supporters began leaving messages of shock and condolence.

""During this heartbreaking time I ask that you keep the family and friends in your thoughts and prayers,” the couple's relatives wrote.

Officials with Craigslist referred to the safety page on the company’s website, which notes, “Be especially careful when buying/selling high value items.”

Tommy Thompson was arrested Tuesday by U.S. Federal Marshals following a global manhunt.

Thompson, who became famous in 1988 after pulling up the treasures of the shipwrecked S.S. Central America, was arrested on a federal civil warrant that was issued in 2012 after he failed to appear at hearings in a civil court case.

""Thompson was one of the most intelligent fugitives ever sought by the U.S. Marshals and he had vast financial resources at his disposal,"" said Peter Tobin of the U.S. Marshall Service.

Thompson and his companion Alison Antekeier were found and arrested at the Hilton Hotel in West Boca Raton, Florida, according to U.S. Marshal Senior Inspector Brian Babtist.

The couple had been living in the hotel for at least two years, said Babtist.

In criminal documents filed today described the state of Thompson's home after his disappearance.

According to a report filed by a U.S. Federal Marshall, a handy man hired by Thompson found a book in Thompson's home titled ""How to Be Invisible"" that detailed how people can evade law enforcement. The man said the house had fallen into disrepair and mold was growing throughout the premises.

To keep cash handy, the criminal complaint alleges that Thompson started putting $10,000 in cash in pipes that were then buried across the premises. Law enforcement officials allege Thompson has only used cash in financial and business transactions since 2005.

Antekeier was also arrested after she failed to appear at a court hearing, where she was going to reveal Thompson's whereabouts.

The couple had last been spotted at Vero Beach, Florida, according to a statement from the U.S. Marshals.

The arrest comes decades after Thompson first grabbed headlines when he and his team pulled artifacts and gold treasures from the S.S. Central America. The finds were estimated to be worth $400 million, according to criminal documents filed by a deputy U.S. marshal.

The gold artifacts were eventually sold in 2000 for about $50 million, according to the Associated Press.

After the treasure was brought up, Thompson was accused of not returning any of the $12.7 million that had been given to him by 161 investors, according to the AP.

Rick Robol, a Columbus, Ohio-based attorney, who had previously defended Thompson's company, said the treasure hunter had been planning on returning to the wreck to bring up more of the gold and give his investors higher returns.

""I believe he was spending his time trying to deal with the challenge of how to recover the downed treasure,"" Robol said of Thompson. ""He indicated that he wanted to make sure that every investor got every penny back and made a profit from the operation.""

Thompson's company was eventually sued by two investors, according to the AP.

Robol said the suits were filed in 2005. Around the same time, Thompson was also sued by members of the team who helped him recover the treasure for not properly compensating them after the recovered gold was sold, said Robol.

The ongoing legal cases lasted from 2005 to 2012, according to Robol, which is when Thompson disappeared. In the criminal complaint, a handy man said small notes were put on the wall detailing various lawsuits involving Thompson.

According to Babtist, Thompson and Antekeier will face an extradition hearing before they are moved to Ohio for further court proceedings.

The Washington Post and BBC first reported the name early Thursday, with the Post citing a close friend who said he or she has ""no doubt"" that Emwazi is the man. A former senior U.S. intelligence official who was involved in the hunt for the man confirmed the name to ABC News.

British authorities have declined to comment on the man's identification. Commander Richard Walton of the London Metropolitan Police's Counter Terrorism Command (SO15) told BBC, ""We have previously asked media outlets not to speculate about the details of our investigation on the basis that life is at risk.""

A spokesperson for the White House National Security Council said they ""are not able to confirm or deny"" the reports on ""Jihadi John's"" identification, and referred questions to the British government.

""The U.S. government continues to investigate the murder of American citizens by ISIL [ISIS],"" the NSC said. ""As the President said, no matter how long it takes, the United States will not rest until we find and hold accountable the terrorists who are responsible for the murders of our citizens.""

The man who would be come to be known as ""Jihadi John"" first appeared in a string of disturbing videos produced by ISIS last August in which he appeared to slice the necks of Western hostages, including American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff. By September, the FBI said it had learned ""Jihadi John's"" identity, but it was not revealed to the public.

A spokesperson for the Sotloff family said today the family is “confident law enforcement would find him and bring him to justice and they have full confidence the U.S. government will be able to do that.”

“They would like to see him brought to a court in New York or eastern Virginia and watch him prosecuted by a U.S. court for beheading their son and convicted to life in a super max facility,” spokesperson Barak Barfi said. “This is how justice is served in this country.”

Bethany Haines, the daughter of British hostage David Haines who was purportedly killed in one of the ISIS videos, told Britain’s ITV that identifying “Jihadi John” was a good step, “but I think all the families will feel closure and relief once there’s a bullet between his eyes.”

Sen. Angus King, a member of the Senate Intelligence and Armed Services Committees, said that by identifying “Jihadi John” it sends a message to anyone who wants to hide “because they put something across their face.”

“Somebody once said, ‘None are so brave as the anonymous.’ I think that one of the things this message says to this guy is that they aren’t going to be anonymous. I would advise this guy right now not to buy any green bananas. I think justice is going to find him,” King said.

According to the BBC, Emwazi was born in Kuwait and was ""known"" to U.K. security agencies. Court documents linked Emwazi to suspected extremist figures, including one man who was killed by a drone strike in Somalia in 2012, the network said.

The Post reported he's believed to have traveled to Syria in 2012."

Dozens of images taken from the rover's robotic arm were woven together to create the selfie, which shows off the Pahrump Hills site where Curiosity has been exploring and drilling to learn more about the Martian environment.

A version of the photo released by NASA points out the various spots where Curiosity has been conducting research over the past five months. The images used for the mosaic selfie were taken at the Mojave 2 drilling site.

""Compared with the earlier Curiosity selfies, we added extra frames for this one so we could see the rover in the context of the full Pahrump Hills campaign,"" Kathryn Stack, a member of the Curiosity team, said in a statement. ""From the Mojave site, we could include every stop we've made during the campaign.""

Curiosity's next stop will be at a site called Telegraph Peak, where NASA plans to have it drill for another sample that can be analyzed and shed new insight on how Mars' environment has changed.

The commissioners voted 3-2 to reclassify Internet service providers as common carriers and impose utility-style regulations, preventing companies from degrading service, limiting access and creating a so-called fast lane with a tiered subscription approach.

FCC received more than 4 million comments on #OpenInternet during past year that helped shape proposal. It’s time to act.

Here's a quick breakdown of what net neutrality means for cable companies and consumers:

Cable Companies

While many Internet service providers say they're committed to a free Internet, what they want from the FCC is more leeway for how they package and sell various Internet plans. Activists have rallied against the idea over the fear it could create toll roads on the so-called ""information superhighway.""

Michael Powell, president and CEO of the National Cable and Telecommunications Association and the former chairman of the FCC, has previously said that over-regulation will not foster an even more open Internet.

What It Means for Consumers

Classifying the consumer broadband service as a public utility under Title II of the 1934 Communications Act would help control what consumers are charged and their access to Internet service, which would be deemed something critical to society.

In everyday terms, think of it this way: There won't be any uneven service, so everyone can stream their Netflix queue more or less at the same speeds. Supporters of net neutrality have also said that without regulation, a greater socio-economic digital divide could develop, creating a class of information ""haves"" and ""have nots.""

The President Weighs In

Since the FCC is an independent body, President Obama has no direct oversight. However, it didn't stop the commander-in-chief from weighing in on the matter of net neutrality last year.

Among the four basic points of the president's plan are no blocking websites for certain users, no throttling (creating a fast and slow lane), more transparency between consumers and Internet service providers, and no paid prioritization to move to the front of the line.

The @FCC just voted to keep the internet open & free. That's the power of millions making their voices heard. Thank you! #NetNeutrality -bo"

Researchers at Cambridge University in England have taken the first steps towards creating artificial sperm and eggs by reprogramming skin cells from adults and converting them into embryonic-like stem cells. The team then compared the engineered stem cells with human cells from fetuses to confirm they were in fact, identical.

The researchers published their findings in the journal Cell earlier this week, stressing that it’s early days for this type of research.

“We have succeeded in the first and most important step of the process,” Dr. Jacob Hanna, an investigator with the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel, told ABC News.

Hanna said the team will now attempt to complete the process by creating fully developed artificial sperm and eggs, either in a dish or by implanting them in a rodent. Once this is achieved, the technique could become useful for any individual with fertility problems, he said, including couples of the same sex.

""It has already caused interest from gay groups because of the possibility of making egg and sperm cells from parents of the same sex,"" Hanna said.

However, the prospect of creating a baby by these artificial means alone is probably a long way off, Hanna said.

“It is really important to emphasize that while this scenario might be technically possible and feasible, it is remote at this stage and many challenges need to be overcome,” he said. “Further, there are very serious ethical and safety issues to be considered when and if such scenarios become considered in the distant future.”

The research was funded by the Wellcome Trust and the Britain Israel Research and Academic Exchange Partnership."

""I grew up around it,” she said. ""I've been an Eagles fan forever.""

The 16-year-old had been preparing for her junior prom when she decided she would ask Eagles' linebacker Emmanuel Acho to be her date for the event.

""I figured I'd give it a shot,"" Hannah said. ""I've seen him on social media and I know he does a lot of charity work. He seemed like a really nice person, so if I was going to ask anyone, it'd be him. And my dad really likes him so that helped, too.""

The teen looked to social media to extend an invite to Acho, 24.

""I never thought it would work,"" she said.

But to Hannah's surprise, Acho answered within just one hour of receiving her message.

""She actually sent me a direct message on Instagram, asking, “If I get 2,000 retweets, will you go to prom with me?'” Acho said. ""I raised the bar and I said, 'If you get 10,000, you got a deal.'""

Acho didn't think she was capable of beating his challenge, he told ABC News.

""She got roughly 15,000 retweets in three hours,"" he said. ""After that, I said, 'Ok, I'm going to prom and how can I make this an extremely special event for her?'""

Acho visited Woodgrove High School in Purcellville, Virginia, last Friday to surprise the teen with his acceptance to prom.

The NFL player traveled from the University of Texas at Austin, where he said he attends graduate school in the off-season.

""I saw him and at first it didn't register all the way,"" Hannah said. ""Then I realized it was him. I was shocked and overwhelmed.

""He didn't know what to say at first because I was crying, but he actually did say, 'Will you go to prom with me?'""

For the May 9 event, Acho said he will be working on the arrangements for him and Hannah.

""I am trying to figure out where to buy a corsage,” he said, laughing. ""I've gotten offers from different car services but, yeah, I also play a little piano and sing. We’ll see if I have a special musical performance.""

On the big night Hannah said she'll be wearing what else but an “Eagles green” dress.

""He'll [Acho] will be wearing classic black with Eagles green accessories,"" Hannah said. ""The Eagles' safety Malcolm Jenkins is hooking him up with an Eagles green bow tie because the color isn't common.""

Since accepting Delmonte's invitation, Acho said he has received ""countless"" prom requests from other teens.

But the football star is happy about his decision to accompany at least one.

""Saying it was humbling is so cliché,"" Acho said. ""It's a very heartwarming feeling because I never realize the impact I have on other people until that moment. When I saw her [Hannah] cry, I truly realized that I play a big impact on people's lives.""

Hannah said she's excited to spend her first prom with friends and to share the experience with Acho.

""I know it won't be a completely normal prom because I'll be with him,” she said, “but I'm looking forward to it."""

Roberta Jacobson, leading the U.S. delegation, said the embassies could be reopened before the April Summit of the Americas, April 10-11 in Panama. Both Presidents Obama and Raul Castro will be in attendance and it could be their first meeting since the announcement to restore diplomatic ties in December.

“I'm very encouraged that we will have an embassy functioning in Havana that is able to do its work,” Jacobson, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs, said.

Adding, in response to a question: ""I do think we can get this done in time for the Summit of the Americas.""

For the Cubans, two big issues are still on the table: remaining on the U.S. terrorist watch list and issues surrounding their inability to work with U.S. banks at their Interest Section, which results in all transactions being in cash.

Josefina Vidal on the Cuban side even emphasized that one issue is not a precondition for the other.

Vidal says it would be difficult for Cuba to consider relations completely normalized while it remains designated as a terrorist state. But she considered the opening of embassies and establishing a relationship separate from the steps being taken to establish full normalization.

""What we are saying is, It's not a precondition. Not a condition. But is a very important issue for Cuba … we hope is addressed and solved,"" added Vidal, who's leading the negotiations for Cuba.

The United States has taken the first step toward removing Cuba from that list, undertaking a review, which when completed must be submitted to Congress prior to Cuba’s being taken off the list of State Sponsors of Terrorism.

The delegations announced a series of bilateral meetings, a half dozen, held over the next few weeks to discuss other concerns, including human rights, marine protected areas, protection of migration front and regulation issues.

And the two sides have agreed to maintain “permanent communication” as they move forward.

“In our case not compromising on our values but to try and resolve this so we can have the kind of relationship,” Jacobson said. “We made sufficient progress on enough [issues]. Some of them are close to resolution, others we have to take back to our respective leadership.”"

“I hope that God opens her eyes and lets her breathe and lets her brain work, and she gets a second chance,” Costner said in an interview with “Nightline” co-anchor Juju Chang last Friday at the W Hotel in Hollywood.

As of last Friday, Brown, 21, was on life support after being found unresponsive, face-down in a bathtub. She is currently being treated at an Atlanta area hospital. Brown is the only child of Houston and singer Bobby Brown.

Several hundred people gathered Monday for a vigil in Brown’s honor at the Amphitheater at Riverdale Town Center in Riverdale, just outside of Atlanta.

""The facts are the facts right now, that she's sitting here, fighting for her life, surrounded by the people who love her the most,"" Costner said.

Costner has long been close with the Houston family. He produced and co-starred in the 1992 film, “The Bodyguard,” with Houston, and it was Costner who suggested they use the song, ""I Will Always Love You,"" as the movie’s signature ballad.

Not only did the movie help launch Houston to mega-stardom, the song, “I Will Always Love You,” became her anthem, earning three Grammys and a spot on Billboard's ""Greatest Songs of All Time” list.

In a case that is strikingly similar to her daughter’s, Whitney Houston was found face down in a hotel bathtub on Feb. 11, 2012, in Beverly Hills, Calif. Authorities ruled her death a drowning, complicated by cocaine use and heart disease.

""My thoughts are probably similar to everyone, which is, obviously, the similarities, what's going on, the worry that this might have happened again,"" Costner said, adding that he is hoping Brown gets “to have a second chance at this most precious life that we are all given.”

Amazon is obsessed with dreaming up ways to get goods to customers even faster in the future and in a newly filed patent application, the company revealed how its hypothetical trucks would be able to print goods while traveling to deliver them to the customer.

While 3D printers don't cover everything on Amazon's site, the idea would be for customers to place an order for something, such as a spare part.

Amazon wouldn't have to store the inventory and would instead 3-D print what was needed on demand, and deliver it to the customer even faster.

Amazon declined ABC News' request for comment on the proposed delivery system.

Earlier this month, the company's vision of drones delivering goods hit another roadblock when the Federal Aviation Administration released new proposals for commercial drone operations, but with several caveats that would keep Amazon Prime Air from become a reality.

While the rules could take as long as two years to be adopted, they seem to be a significant roadblock on Amazon's plans to create a drone delivery network that CEO Jeff Bezos has said he hopes will one day be as common as seeing a mail truck.

""Based on the proposal, even then those rules wouldn't allow Prime Air to operate in the United States,"" Paul Misener, vice president of global public policy at Amazon, said in a statement to ABC News.

""The FAA needs to begin and expeditiously complete the formal process to address the needs of our business, and ultimately our customers. We are committed to realizing our vision for Prime Air and are prepared to deploy where we have the regulatory support we need,"" he said."

Just two hours before the midnight deadline, the House voted 357 to 60 to fund the department for one week. The Senate passed the measure earlier in the evening by a voice vote.

President Obama signed it into law late Friday.

Less than one hour before the vote, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi sent her Democratic colleagues a letter urging them to advance the seven-day measure.

Though the department will be funded, the one-week measure will set up a new round of fighting for lawmakers on Capitol Hill. The dysfunction that has become all too familiar on Capitol Hill was on full display today as the House earlier failed to secure enough votes to pass a short-term funding bill that would have kept the department open for three weeks.

That last-minute strategy proposed by House Republicans failed with a vote of 203 to 224. Fifty-two Republicans opposed the measure while 12 Democrats supported it.

President Obama held a meeting in the Oval Office late Friday with DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson and OMB Director Shaun Donovan to discuss the potential shutdown, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said. The president personally phoned House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid to receive an update on the situation.

The evening’s drama rounds out months of fighting between Democrats and Republicans over the funding. Republicans have wanted to link any funding for the department to immigration. Earlier this month, the House passed a bill that would fund the department through the end of the fiscal year while also blocking President Obama’s recent executive actions on immigration.

But Democrats opposed that plan, instead pushing for a clean funding bill. Earlier in the day, the Senate passed a clean funding measure with a vote of 68 to 31 to fund the Department of Homeland Security through Sept. 30.

“We passed a full-year funding for the Department of Homeland Security,” Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., said. “It means we did our job so that those men and women working in every agency can do their job to protect America. The Senate has done its job. Now, the House has to do its job.”

Lawmakers will now have one week to hammer out their differences on the funding and immigration. If not, the Department of Homeland Security will have to furlough approximately 40,000 workers. But 80 percent of its 240,000-person workforce would be required to work without pay. This figure includes 40,000 Customs and Border Protection officers, 5,000 Transportation Security Administration security screeners, and 13,000 Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.

""He and a couple of people came to me on Monday and he stated that he had concerns about his safety,"" Detroit Police Capt. Aric Tosqui told ABC News of James Robertson. ""We went into action.

""I gave a call to one of the local people in my community I knew and he had something available and was willing to help him,"" Tosqui said. ""I would say the move happened in probably about 20 minutes. We threw his belongings into some garbage bags and that was it.""

Robertson, a factory worker, moved into the apartment donated by a local businessman on Tuesday. He kept his new car, a red Ford Taurus donated by a local dealership, at a police precinct Monday night until he moved into his new, temporary home.

Robertson had previously been living in a home with a woman identified in press reports as his girlfriend.

Robertson's move was partly motivated by recent reported attacks on local people who'd come into money, according to police.

""In Detroit, there were a couple of situations where both [people] were alleged lottery winners and a couple of people had heard about it in the neighborhood, that the people got a windfall,"" Tosqui said. ""He talked to me about one of those situations.""

Robertson was featured in a Detroit Free Press article that went viral earlier this month after it detailed his daily 20-plus mile walking commute to and from work.

A 19-year-old Detroit college student, Evan Leedy, who read that story started a GoFundMe page with the simple hope of raising enough money to get Robertson a car. The story went viral and the GoFundMe page has now raised more than $350,000 for Robertson, far exceeding the initial $25,000 goal.

Robertson has yet to receive any of the money donated on GoFundMe, according to Leedy.

“We have a meeting in the coming days and we’ll find out more then about what James wants to do with the money and how he’s going to receive it,” Leedy told ABC News, referring to a four-member team of legal and financial advisers who are volunteering their services for Robertson.

That team will now work with Robertson to determine where he moves permanently and how, and when, he receives the money.

""Now that his concerns for safety are handled, he is working with them, not police,"" Tosqui said. ""He will have the apartment for a few days, maybe a week. That is between him and the landlord now but the assumption was it was going to be for a very brief time.""

Robertson is also still working at his $10.55-per-hour factory job, according to Blake Pollock, a local financial adviser who befriended Robertson after seeing him on his daily commute.

“His main priority is to work,” Pollock told ABC News. “That’s what it always was before and that’s what it will be.

“He just has a lot more time on his hands because he doesn’t have to leave so early for work,” he said of Robertson. “He can leave 45 minutes before and not have to think about it.”

Speaking at the White House's cybersecurity summit at Stanford today, Apple CEO Tim Cook announced the payment system, which uses unique one-time codes to keep purchases and financial information private, would be supported for many transactions with the federal government beginning in September.

The move includes everything from federal payments cards to simply paying for admission to a National Park.

""We can imagine a day in the not so distant future when your wallet becomes a remnant of the past,"" Cook said.

Apple Pay launched in October and is available on the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus for use in participating brick and mortar stores.

All users have to do is position their iPhone near one of the readers at a store, hold their finger on their Touch ID and they're good to go. The simple, swift checkout motion is made easy due to the the Near Field Communication antenna in the iPhone 6, which connects with the payment point to complete the transaction.

Aside from touting Apple Pay, Cook's speech highlighted the delicate balance the White House and the private sector are trying to strike, at an event skipped by several major tech CEOs.

In an executive order to be signed today, Obama will try to establish lines of communication for companies to share more cybersecurity info with the government—something companies could be skeptical of, amid tensions over privacy in the wake of Snowden’s revelations.

""If those of us in positions of responsibility fail to do everything in our power to protect the right of privacy, we risk something far more valuable than money,"" Cook said, laying out a vision for a ""future that fully embraces both privacy and security."""

John Kitzhaber announced his resignation today.

The decision comes after his resisting calls to do so for weeks from top state Democrats, editorial pages and petition-writers, in light of a conflict-of-interest scandal involving plum jobs his fiancee, Cylvia Hayes, got with groups who had business before the state, while she also worked as an unpaid adviser to him on energy and economic development.

Earlier today, Kitzhaber was nowhere to be seen. Here’s a rundown of events that led to his stepping down.

By today, he was nowhere to be seen. Here’s a rundown of events from the past week:

THURSDAY, FEB. 5: The Oregonian newspaper’s editorial page calls for Kitzhaber to resign, saying, “He can no longer lead Oregon effectively and should resign. His constituents deserve better.”

Kitzhaber had defiantly insisted the week before he would not step down and denied there was any conflict of interest in Hayes’ various jobs: “We tried to separate her volunteer work as first lady from her paid work,” he said.

FRIDAY, FEB. 6: Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum opens a criminal investigation into Kitzhaber and Hayes, saying in a statement the allegations about the way Kitzhaber handled Hayes’ contracts are “very serious, and troubling.”

MONDAY: Kitzhaber sends a letter to Rosenblum, asking her to open a “full and independent factual review” of the issues surrounding him and Hayes. She tells him she has already opened the investigation.

TUESDAY: Kitzhaber calls Oregon Secretary of State Kate Brown, visiting Washington, D.C., for a conference, asking her to “come back to Oregon as soon as possible to speak with him in person and alone,” Brown said.
Kitzhaber also meets with Oregon Senate President Peter Courtney, a meeting Courtney later says he left feeling certain the governor was going to resign.

WEDNESDAY: Brown returns to Oregon, which raises eyebrows among political observers because the Secretary of State is the second-in-line for the governorship. Brown says she met with Kitzhaber briefly, and that he asked her why she came back early from D.C., although he asked her to do so, which she said she found “strange.”

Kitzhaber tells Brown he does not want to resign but “began a discussion about transition,” according to Brown.

Later in the day, Kitzhaber releases a statement: “Let me be as clear as I was last week, that I have no intention of resigning as Governor of the state of Oregon. I was elected to do a job for the people of this great state and I intend to continue to do so.”

THURSDAY: The Oregonian reports that Kitzhaber had, indeed, intended to resign Tuesday but changed his mind by Wednesday after meeting with McDermott and Hayes. Kitzhaber meets with Courtney and House Speaker Tina Kotek. At a news conference after the meeting, Courtney and Kotek call Kitzhaber “upset,” “defiant” and “struggling.” “This thing is evolving by the second,” Courtney says.

Rosenblum, the attorney general, rules that Hayes must release emails from her personal accounts pertaining to government business. Hayes had claimed she is an honorary first lady and is not compelled to produce emails, and that she held no formal government position and had no government authority, the Oregonian wrote.

TODAY: The Oregonian reports Kitzhaber’s whereabouts are not publicly known, and that the governor had “vanished from public view"" before he said he would resign.

The governor’s office did not respond to an ABC News request for comment."

“I’m in a place where I will be able to provide for my family and really change my life,” Meeks told ABC News from a Nevada prison. “I never thought that everyone in the world would recognize me for my looks, so I feel extremely blessed and very thankful.”

The chisel-jawed, blue-eyed Californian became an Internet sensation last year when his mug shot went viral after the Stockton Police Department posted it on its Facebook page. Meeks was sentenced several weeks ago to 27 months of prison on weapon charges, but hopes for a November release that accounts for time served and good behavior.

Meeks is now working with agent Jim Jordan of White Cross Management and said he plans to take full advantage of his viral fame.

In preparation for his release and foray into modeling, Meeks said that he is working on getting ripped.

“I eat healthy. I do a lot of push-ups, pull-ups, dips, burpees, and I stay very active,” he said.

Meeks said he wants to try his hand at both modeling and acting. “I wish I could be on a show like 'Sons of Anarchy,'” said Meeks.

Jordan is confident Meeks’ notoriety can propel him into a successful career. “There is a sea of opportunities waiting for him,” Jordon said, who is working to set Meeks up with “modeling agencies around the world, endorsement deals and reality show interests.”

As for that mug shot, Meeks said he wasn't intentionally giving his best “blue steel” for the picture.

“I was just thinking about missing my family,” he said. “I was really thinking about my son a lot at that moment, that was the only thing that was on my mind.”

Until then, Meeks said he is keeping his head down and relying on backing from the outside.

“I've got a lot of support my family, my friends, and from my fans -- I get hundreds and hundreds of letters every month. I’m very thankful for all the support I've been getting,” Meeks said."

If you're not familiar with the term, they're adult male fans of the children's toy and eponymous TV show, ""My Little Pony.""

The My Little Pony toys have been around since the early 1980s but didn't catch on with men on a wider scale until the release of the 2010 animated series ""My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic.""

While ""Friendship Is Magic"" is every bit the children's series it intended to be, the writing is deceptively sophisticated and adult humor is subtly woven through the series without the younger audience knowing, according to Bronies.

Those inside jokes, along with high-quality animation, has created a fan base that rivals Trekkies in their passion and knowledge.

To see the phenomenon for ourselves, ABC News visited Ponycon, a My Little Pony convention in Brooklyn. It was a mix of My Little Pony fans, young and old, where fans dressed in costume and shared three days of friendship, magic and harmony."

But for a group of second-graders in Kansas, that dream has already become a reality.

A class of students from Belinder Elementary School in Prairie Village, Kansas, submitted questions to President Obama on behalf of their school newspaper, and the president answered.

“What advice do you have for second-graders and other students?” the students wrote to President Obama.

“Dream big dreams,” President Obama responded. “You are fortunate to live in a country where if you work hard, do the right thing and listen to your parents, you can be anything you want to be.”

The interview is now published in the latest edition of The Belinder School’s newspaper, “The Marbel News.”

So how exactly does a group of second-graders from Kansas land an interview with the president?

Their teacher attributes their success in part to what he calls the “the cuteness factor.” It also helped that a parent of one of the students in the class knows White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest, and Earnest agreed to pass along some questions to the president’s desk.

""I thought it would be really cool to interview the president because he's, like, famous,"" one student said.

""I thought it was awesome, but I also thought it was too good to be true and I was just having a dream,"" commented another."

Dr. Mitchell Dunn, a board-certified psychiatrist at Terrell State Hospital in Texas, interviewed the defendant for six hours last spring -- an abnormally long interview, he said.

One month before the shooting, Routh said he believed his co-workers at the cabinet company were cannibals and wanted to eat him, Dunn recalled from his interview. Routh also said he believed his neighbor, a police detective, was a member of the Mexican Mafia, Dunn recalled.

""Mental illness is not the way it is portrayed in movies,"" Dunn said.

Routh also told Dunn that he thought pigs were taking over the world. Routh said he thought his co-workers and ex-girlfriend Jen Weed were ""pig hybrids"" -- half man and half pig -- Dunn recalled, adding that Routh also described Kyle and Littlefield as ""pig assassins.""

When Kyle picked up Routh on the day of the shootings, Routh said he was upset that Kyle didn't introduce himself or shake his hand, Dunn said.

And Routh called the drive to the gun range a ""one-way trip,"" Dunn recalled.

At the gun range, Routh wanted to neutralize what he perceived as a threat, Dunn testified, so he shot Littlefield first, and then when Kyle began to turn around, he shot him in the back.

Routh claimed he acted in self-defense, according to Dunn.

During the prosecution's cross-examination of Dunn, the psychiatrist said it was his expert opinion that Routh did not suffer from PTSD, only mental illness.

Jodi Routh, the mother of the accused killer, was also back on the stand today. When a prosecutor asked if she disclosed to Kyle that her son had been in the hospital just weeks before she arranged their meeting, she said, ""it didn't occur to me at the time.""

Kyle, who was helping war veterans after he retired as a Navy SEAL sniper, had agreed to help Routh that day at the gun range in February 2013.

Earlier today, the defense called Charles Overstreet, who has a Ph.D. in clinical social work and assessed Routh in jail. Overstreet said he believes Routh suffered from symptoms of paranoid schizophrenia and post-traumatic stress disorder, and that he thinks Routh misinterpreted Kyle and Littlefield's behavior as ""threatening.""

The prosecution objected to Overstreet's testimony, leading to a sidebar. Then the judge ruled that Overstreet could not testify for the jury.

Kyle, who was considered the deadliest sniper in U.S. military history, served four tours in Iraq and helped found a veterans organization.

He also wrote a best-selling autobiography, which served as the basis for the film ""American Sniper,"" starring Bradley Cooper. ""American Sniper"" is up for six Oscars at this weekend's Academy Awards, and its popularity played a role in jury selection earlier this year.

The three tickets matched the numbers 25, 11, 54, 13 and 39, with a Powerball of 19.

According to the Texas Lottery, one of the winning tickets was sold at an Appletree Food Mart in Princeton, which is located about 50 miles northeast of Dallas. The stores where the tickets were sold in North Carolina and Puerto Rico aren't known.

Experts estimated the odds of winning at 175 million to one.

Powerball is played in 44 states, Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

The jackpot is the third-largest in Powerball history. The last time a Powerball jackpot climbed so high was in 2013 when a Florida ticket won a $590.5 million prize.

Should the winners select the lump sum option, each would get a one-third share of $381,138,450.16 before taxes. The other option is an annuity, under which the lottery would make payments 30 times over 29 years.

The jackpot goes back to $40 million for the next drawing, which takes place on Saturday.

1vmlk5I,2015-02-21 00:00:00,Kurt Busch suspended indefinitely - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/kurt-busch-suspended-indefinitely/story?id=29116354,"Earlier Friday it was ruled that Busch smashed his ex-girlfriend Patricia Driscoll's head against his motor home wall Sept. 26 at Dover International Speedway, according to the conclusions of a Kent County (Del.) family court commissioner who granted Driscoll's request for a protective order Monday.

""Given the serious nature of the findings and conclusions made by the Commissioner of the Family Court of the State of Delaware, NASCAR has indefinitely suspended driver Kurt Busch, effective immediately,"" NASCAR said in a statement. ""He will not be allowed to race nor participate in any NASCAR activities until further notice.

""Kurt Busch and his Stewart-Haas Racing team are fully aware of our position and why this decision was made. We will continue to respect the process and timetable of the authorities involved.""

Busch on Friday night filed paperwork for an appeal on his suspension, which will be heard at noon ET Saturday in Daytona, NASCAR spokesman David Higdon said.

""We are extremely disappointed that NASCAR has suspended Kurt Busch,"" Busch's attorney, Rusty Hardin, said in a statement Friday afternoon. ""We assure everyone, including NASCAR, that this action against Mr. Busch will turn out to be a travesty of justice, apparent to all, as this story continues to unfold.""

Hardin, who cannot represent Busch in the NASCAR appeal because the appeal process does not allow for lawyers to represent NASCAR members, reiterated his hope that the family court commissioner reconsiders his opinion based on additional evidence that would show Driscoll is not credible.

""It is important for everyone to remember that the commissioner's report has to do with a civil, family law matter and no criminal charges have been filed against Mr. Busch,"" Hardin said. ""We ask everyone's patience as this case continues in the court of law and are confident that when the truth is known Mr. Busch will be fully vindicated and back in the driver's seat.""

NASCAR appeals are heard by a three-member panel selected from a list of former drivers, racing promoters and racing executives in the NASCAR rule book.

During the appeal, NASCAR will present its evidence, Busch will make his argument and then they both are permitted opportunities for rebuttal. Both sides can bring witnesses but not legal counsel, and the panelists can summon any NASCAR member from whom they want to hear.

If Busch loses the appeal, he can make one last appeal to former Gulfstream president Bryan Moss, NASCAR's final appeals officer. NASCAR chairman Brian France also has the ability to lift the suspension at any time.

It wasn't immediately clear if Busch wins his appeal whether he could still drive for SHR, which gets a significant amount of financial support from Chevrolet.

In her statement, Driscoll said she did not consider this a ""victory.""

""For victims of domestic violence there are no victories,"" she said. ""My only hope is that the pain and trauma I suffered through this process will help other victims find their voice."

But what if the last thing you want is chicken soup or crackers, and you're craving ice cream or a glass of wine? It depends on what's wrong with you, experts say. Here are common symptoms and expert suggestions on foods that help—and hinder—relief.

For diarrhea caused by a stomach virus or a meal that didn't agree with you, try the BRAT diet, says James Lee, MD, gastroenterologist with St. Joseph Hospital in Orange, Calif. ""Many different things can cause diarrhea, such as Crohn's disease or colitis,"" so see your doctor if symptoms continue for longer than two weeks or sooner if signs of dehydration appear, or if diarrhea is accompanied by fever, blood, severe pain, or severe nausea and vomiting.

Best foods: The BRAT diet: bananas, rice, applesauce and toast. Also oatmeal, boiled potatoes, saltine crackers, and baked chicken or turkey without skin are safe bets.

Worst foods: Sugarless candy and gum containing sorbitol or other artificial sweeteners, which aren't digestible and can trigger diarrhea. Other foods that can cause gas and bloating include onions, apples, broccoli, cabbages, and beans. Dairy may also aggravate diarrhea, as well as alcohol and caffeine.

27 Mistakes Healthy People Make

Constipation can occur when not eating enough fiber-rich whole grains, fruits, and veggies, which stimulate digestion. ""Adults need between 25 and 30 grams of fiber a day,"" says Dr. Lee.

Best foods: High-fiber whole grain breads, nuts, beans, prunes, oatmeal, flaxseed, broccoli, pears, and apples. (Here are the 20 best foods for fiber.) Drinking six to eight glasses of water per day also helps get things moving, says Dr. Lee.

Worst foods: Chocolate, dairy products, iron supplements, narcotics (pain medications) and some blood and anti depression medications may worsen constipation.

13 Things You Should Know About the Stomach Flu

Feeling queasy makes all foods sound unappealing, but the right ones can ease symptoms by calming stomach acids, says Dr. Lee. ""In general, keep food portions small and odors to a minimum.""

Best foods: Saltine crackers or pretzels can help, says Dr. Lee, as does small quantities of dry toast or cereal. Ginger or lemon tea, fresh or frozen lemon slices, and peppermint also work.

Worst foods: Greasy, spicy, or oily foods, caffeine, alcohol, and carbonated drinks can make nausea worse.

When you have a sore throat, several foods can coat your throat and soothe the pain, says Lauren Slayton, RD, founder ofFoodtrainers.com and author of The Little Book of Thin (Perigee 2014).

Best foods: Combine peppermint tea (lukewarm, not hot)—which has analgesic and anesthetic effects—and Manuka honey, which is known for its wound-healing properties. Soft, creamy foods such as cream soups, mashed potatoes, yogurt, scrambled eggs, and custards are also soothing.

Worst foods: Avoid hot liquids and hard, scratchy foods such as potato chips, nuts, and granola. The acidic juices from raw fruits and vegetables, as well as orange juice, grape juice, and lemonade can also irritate a sore throat.

10 Ways to Soothe a Sore Throat

Foods that ease muscle aches depend on the specific reason for the body aches, says Kristine Arthur, MD, internist at Orange Coast Memorial Medical Center in Fountain Valley, Calif. ""For general muscle aches, food containing magnesium or calcium may help ease soreness,"" she says.

Best foods: Magnesium-containing foods include nuts, bananas, beans, leafy greens, and avocados. Foods high in calcium such as canned salmon, yogurt, dark-green leafy greens, and orange juice fortified with calcium also lessen muscle cramping and pain.

Worst foods: Anything that dehydrates you can worsen muscle aches, says Dr. Arthur, particularly alcohol and caffeine.

14 Reasons You're Always Tired

Dehydration is one of the leading causes of headaches, says Dr. Arthur, so it's best to treat that cause first and see if it relieves your pain.

Best foods: Water and other fluids are your best bet. ""Drink a bottle of water and wait 20 minutes to see if you feel better,"" says Dr. Arthur. Caffeine is known for drying you out, but ironically, it can help in small doses. ""But for each cup of tea or coffee, drink an equal amount of water to avoid dehydration,"" Dr. Arthur says.

Worst foods: Headache-triggering foods include artificial sweeteners, MSG (found in sauces and soy sauce), aged cheeses (blue, stilton) that contain tyramine, plus chocolate, red wine, hot dogs, deli meats, and dried fruit. MSG is metabolized to glutamate, an excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain, says Dr. Arthur. Tyramine links to increased blood pressure, which can trigger headaches.

Earaches typically accompany other symptoms, says Dr. Arthur. ""So they're not correlated with any food in general."" Since they occur most often with upper respiratory infections, however, foods that clear up congestion can help earaches as well.

Best foods: Clear fluids and chicken soup ease congestion by loosening up mucous in nasal passages. Omega-3s found in salmon and nuts decrease inflammation, and vitamin C found in dark leafy greens, berries, and citrus boost the immune system, says Dr. Arthur.

Worst foods: Dairy can thicken phlegm and worsen congestion, with the exception of yogurt, which contains probiotics, says Dr. Arthur. ""Stay away from processed and packaged foods, too, which increase inflammation and lengthen the recovery process.""

A rash could be a symptom of an allergy, says Dr. Arthur. ""Keep a detailed food journal to look for links to foods that seem to trigger a rash.""

Best foods: Omega-3 containing foods such as fatty fish (salmon, sardines) and walnut and flax seed oils, as well as foods high in protein are all important for skin health, says Dr. Arthur. ""Skin is made up of proteins, so a diet adequate in protein is necessary for skin protein synthesis.""

Worst foods: The most common foods that cause itching are nuts, chocolate, fish, tomatoes, eggs, berries, soy, wheat, and milk, says Debra Jaliman, MD, dermatologist and author of Skin Rules: Trade Secrets from a Top New York Dermatologist ($9, amazon.com).

15 Diseases Doctors Often Get Wrong

When you have a cold, the worst symptom might be a nose that just won't stop running. Aside from taking a steamy shower, Slayton suggests drinking warm tea—it may not slow down the drip, but a soothing tea will make you feel better.

Best foods: Try Wakaya ginger tea, suggests Slayton. Ginger contains antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that may help clear up a cold faster than just waiting it out. ""Apple cider and lemon in water works well, too,"" she says.

Worst foods: Spicy foods can cause an immediate runny nose (which then turns into congestion), as may alcohol.

A cold, flu or sinus infection can irritate and inflame blood vessels in your nose, making it hard to breathe. Aside from inhaling steam from a hot shower or using a humidifier, if you're stopped up due to mucous, some foods can help.

Best foods: Slayton recommends ""golden milk,"" which includes turmeric, a spice known for its anti-inflammatory properties. Place 2 cups of coconut or almond milk in a saucepan with 1 tsp dried turmeric, 1 tsp dried ginger, a dash of black pepper and honey to taste. Bring to a simmer, allow to sit for 10 minutes and serve warm.

Worst foods: Skip dairy, spicy foods, and sugar, all of which can aggravate symptoms, says Slayton.

But it turns out they're hearing a winter phenomenon that's uncommon to the region.

""It sounded like an explosion underneath. It moved the floor,"" one resident told the 911 call center in Spring Hill, Tennessee.

""They say it sounded like a plane hit the building. But it was three different buildings,"" the caller said, according to ABC affiliate WKRN in Nashville.

People often hear this noise more acutely at night because ambient noise during the day tends to drown it out.

""Whenever we get really cold weather, with temperatures around zero, ice or snow on the ground or previous rain event, you'll usually hear this at night,"" said Bobby Boyd, meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Nashville. ""It's just a sudden cracking in the frozen soil or rock that's saturated with ice.""

During his 49 years of experience, Boyd said he's been hearing more of this activity this winter, which he attributes it to the record-breaking cold. This winter has been the first time there have been sub-zero degrees Fahrenheit temperatures in Nashville since February 1996.

Boyd, 68, said he is surprised that callers have likened the sound to a loud boom or believed it was an airplane crash.

""It's like an explosion but a muffled boom sound. It's not really loud, at least the ones I heard,"" Boyd said.

But it was loud enough to wake Boyd up at 4:30 a.m. two nights ago, and clearly audible at 7 p.m. last night.

Boyd said he hasn't heard of a frost quake causing property damage, as it often happens in a relatively shallow part of the ground, but he doesn't rule it out.

""Any movement in the ground where you have frost and freeze, even without the explosion, can cause cracks in sidewalks or heaving in the soil. Winter time is hard on roads and paved areas,"" he said."
1vNsuuv,2015-02-19 00:00:00,Renowned Neurologist Oliver Sacks Announces He Has Terminal Cancer - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Health/renowned-neurologist-oliver-sacks-announces-terminal-cancer/story?id=29084210,"Renowned neurologist and author of ""Awakenings"" Oliver Sacks announced today that he has terminal cancer.

Sacks, a professor of neurology at New York University School of Medicine, said in a New York Times article that cancer had been found in his liver nine years after he was first diagnosed with a rare ocular tumor.

The doctor wrote that the initial treatment for the tumor in his eye left him partially blind and noted that most tumors of this kind do not metastasize.

""I am among the unlucky 2 percent,"" he wrote for the New York Times. ""I feel grateful that I have been granted nine years of good health and productivity since the original diagnosis, but now I am face to face with dying.""

Sacks, 81, is best known for his writing on neurological case histories including ""The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat"" and an ""An Anthropologist on Mars."" His book ""Awakenings,"" based on his work in the 1960s with patients who were unable to initiate movement, was turned into an Oscar-nominated movie of the same name starring Robin Williams and Robert De Niro.

Sacks, whose biography will be released this spring, wrote that he feels ""intensely alive"" after his diagnosis.

""Over the last few days, I have been able to see my life as from a great altitude, as a sort of landscape, and with a deepening sense of the connection of all its parts,"" he wrote. ""This does not mean I am finished with life.""

While the famed doctor plans to give up following ""politics or arguments about global warming,"" he said he feels the world is being left in good hands.

""I cannot pretend I am without fear. But my predominant feeling is one of gratitude,"" he wrote. ""Above all, I have been a sentient being, a thinking animal, on this beautiful planet, and that in itself has been an enormous privilege and adventure."""

1vP3pzu,2015-02-20 00:00:00,"Potential Measles Exposure Sites Include Calif. Target, Walmart, Health Officials Say - ABC News",http://abcnews.go.com/Health/potential-measles-exposure-sites-include-calif-target-walmart/story?id=29103193,"Two outbreaks of the measles virus that have infected at least 141 people have lead state and local health departments to release lists of the sites where residents might have been exposed to the virus in the hopes of curbing the outbreak.

In California, the San Bernardino County Health Department's list reveals how staples of the community, such as grocery stores or a Walmart, could be sites of potential infections and not just hospitals or schools with low vaccination rates.

Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert from Vanderbilt University Medical Center, said the range of potential infectious sites shows how important it is that every eligible person gets the measles vaccine.

The virus ""can be in a house of worship, it can be at a theme park. It can really be anywhere,” said Schaffner. “There doesn’t have to be close contact through the measles source and the susceptible person,” to get infected.

In San Bernardino, where nine people measles cases have been reported, the health department list reflects a variety of places where people could have been exposed to the measles virus, from Walmart to Target to a local sushi restaurant and chocolate store.

A Walmart spokesman told ABC News that company officials ""take the safety of our customers and associates very seriously"" and had instructed their associates, who were working when an infected person visited the store, to adhere to the health department's guidance.

A Target spokesman told ABC News that the company has posted a notice in the store and were working with local health officials.

The measles virus is among the most contagious viruses identified and can be transmitted four days before an infected person shows symptoms. By simply exhaling, an infected person can leave virus particles in the air that can infect anyone who does not have immunity."
1vPJyjA,2015-02-20 00:00:00,3-D Printed Heart Gives New Hope to Woman With 'Backwards' Heart - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Health/printed-heart-hope-woman-backwards-heart/story?id=29107278,"A 3-D printed heart has given new hope to a 26-year-old woman who was born with a “backwards” heart.

Kami Sutton, of Marysville, Washington, has already undergone 19 surgeries to help connect her heart to the rest of her body.

She was born with a congenital heart defect that resulted in her heart being on the right side of her body instead of the left side. Additionally, Sutton’s left and right pumping chambers were reversed and her heart was not initially connected to her lungs. She also had a hole in her heart between the two chambers.

While surgeries and a pacemaker have helped keep Sutton alive, her heart has been weakened by constant stress and overexertion.

Last year, Sutton started working with Dr. Stephan Seslar, a congenital heart disease specialist and electrophysiologist at Seattle Children’s Hospital and University of Washington Medical Center, to see if a new pacemaker would work better.

Seslar is now attempting hoping to use a bi-ventricular pacemaker that will help Sutton's ventricles beat at the same time. But the unusual shape and placement of Sutton’s heart remains a huge hurdle.

“Kami’s heart is truly one-of-a-kind,” Seslar said on the Seattle Children’s Hospital website. “Operating on her without understanding the anatomy of her heart better could be very dangerous.”

To help doctors plan out Sutton's surgery, Seslar created a specially designed 3-D model of Sutton's heart. It’s an idea she initially suggested to Seslar, who had already been working on similar models.

“His eyes got really wide,” Sutton remembered of the moment she asked if he could use a 3-D model of her heart. “When I suggested it, he got really excited.”

To create a model of Sutton’s heart, she underwent a CT scan so that the exact measurements of her heart could be diagrammed. Seslar then worked with a materials engineer to create a special material that would mimic heart tissue.

“Our first attempts produced stiff models that did not feel like human hearts,” Seslar said on the Seattle Children’s Hospital website. “This model is soft and wet like a real heart inside a person. ... We know ahead of time where to maneuver, it allows us to develop a game plan and potentially reduce the surgery time.”

Sutton, who works as a grassroots coordinator for the American Heart Association, hasn’t seen the model of her heart yet, but said she feels privileged to benefit from the new technology.

“Technology caught up with me just in time and gave me another chance besides the big [transplant] surgery,” Sutton said of both this experience and her past surgeries.

Sutton is on the heart transplant list, but her previous surgeries means she needs a very particular kind of organ that will not be rejected by her immune system. However, she said if the pacemaker works she may not need the new heart."

Seven people have become infected with the drug-resistant ""superbug"" known as CRE at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center after undergoing endoscopy procedures, and CRE may have played a role in two of its patients' deaths, the hospital said Wednesday afternoon, adding that 179 people were exposed to the germ.

""There are several manufacturers for these scopes,"" said Dr. Benjamin Schwartz, deputy chief of the acute communicable disease control program, Los Angeles County Department of Public Health. ""Because of the complexity of these scopes, which is necessary for the life-saving procedures for these scopes, they are very, very difficult to clean. The manufacturer recommendations were followed by UCLA.""

The first case occurred in mid-December when a patient became ill after undergoing endoscopy to examine his or her gallbladder, the hospital has learned.

""The patient developed almost immediately an infection afterwards with unusual bacteria that was resistant to strains of normally active antibiotics,"" Rubin said, explaining that it took time to trace the cases back to this original patient.

The hospital has now taken all of its scopes out of use, and has implemented additional cleaning protocols beyond manufacturer recommendations. It has emailed and called all patients who underwent endoscopy from Oct. 23 through Jan. 28, officials said."

That phrase rings true for a Florida family that lost Stephen Merrill, 31, who loved superhero comics so much that they wrote in his obituary on Sunday that he passed away due to an ""uppercut from Batman.""

Merrill, a father of a 7-year-old boy, died unexpectedly at home in Winter Haven, Florida, on Feb. 12, and the family didn't know the cause of death when they wanted to submit an obituary before his funeral, his sister Kimberly Merrill told ABC News today. Their dad suggested they just make up something ""exotic,"" she said.

""One of Stephen's friends Brandon Moxam suggested to say he died from Batman's uppercut because he was a huge Batman fan,"" his sister said. ""Everyone laughed, and we knew that was what Stephen would've wanted us to say.""

The Ledger, based in Lakeland, Florida, was resistant to publishing the obituary at first, but after Stephen's close friend Andrew Albreacht told the manager of the obituaries department it would mean the world to them to honor Stephen in this way, the newspaper finally agreed, his sister said.

The funeral on Tuesday was just as unconventional as Stephen's obituary, his fiancee Stephanie Vella told ABC News.

""It was more of a celebration of his life rather than a funeral,"" Vella said. ""A bunch of us wore superhero t-shirts or bright colors, we told funny stories about Stephen and of course, we played some music from some of his favorite superhero movies like 'Star Spangled Man' from 'Captain America' and the 'Evolution of Batman.'""

There was even a ""Captain America"" shield flower arrangement made from roses and carnations, Vella said.

""Stephen was the family's superhero,"" Vella said. ""He was the glue that held the family together. He had so many legitimate reasons to not be positive, but he always remained so positive. He was so kind and caring.""

Merrill was diagnosed with testicular cancer near the end of June 2013, and has gone in and out of remission and the hospital for the past two years, Vella said, adding he was just about to start aggressive chemotherapy before his death. But despite all this, he remained a ray of light to the family, she said.

""He was a big kid,"" she added. ""There was nothing he liked better than playing 'Lego Batman' with our son Noah on the Xbox. Noah is also a huge fan of superheroes and Legos, and he always loved telling people his daddy worked at Legoland.""

Vella said every day is a struggle for her.

""I want to tell him, 'Babe, I know you’re looking down on all of us right now, and before you passed you questioned if you had done enough with your life and what your legacy would be,'"" Vella said. ""But this is your legacy. Look at how many lives you've touched, people you've made laugh and the mark you've left on this world.""

Vella said she is having a ""Batman"" tattoo designed for her to pay tribute to Stephen.

The family has since found out the cause of death, but the family has asked ABC News not to disclose it."

Marie Holmes, 26, a single mother of four children ages 9 months to 7-years old, is the state's biggest Powerball winner.

The $564.1 million jackpot, which has a cash value of $381 million, is the fifth largest lottery prize in U.S. history. The jackpot had increased over two months without a winner, starting at $40 million.

""This is going to make a huge difference for them,"" Holmes said of her children. ""They are going to be able to go to school and not worry about paying for it. They are going to live a comfortable life without struggling.""

Holmes, who said she is a ""full-time mother,"" said she's planning to continue her education in the nursing field while caring for her children. From Shallotte, North Carolina, she previously supported her children while working at Walmart, Food Lion, KFC, McDonald's and Subway restaurants.

""It was seven of us living in one home,"" she told reporters at a news conference. ""It wasn't comfortable but we made do. Everybody in that household will have their own place, because I don't plan on staying there.""

The occasional lottery player said the farthest she has traveled in the U.S. is Seattle and New York, but she's never left the country. She also said she is speaking with a financial adviser about the money, but she hopes to travel and give some money to a church, which she declined to name. She also hopes to give to an organization dedicated to cerebral palsy, because one of her children has the neurological disorder that affects muscle movement.

The Brunswick County resident presented one of the three winning tickets for the $564.1 million jackpot, the third-largest Powerball jackpot ever.

The largest Powerball jackpot was recorded on May 18, 2013, ultimately awarded to Gloria Mackenzie of Zephyrills, Florida.

North Carolina's largest jackpot winner matched all five white balls in the Feb. 11 Powerball drawing, giving her one-third of the prize.

The annuity payment provides $188 million, but she is choosing the $127 million lump sum.

Powerball is played in 44 states, Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

The three tickets matched the numbers 25, 11, 54, 13 and 39, with a Powerball of 19. The odds of winning were about 175 million to one."
1vte2gi,2015-02-24 00:00:00,"Early Peanut Exposure May Reduce Allergies, 'Game-Changer' Study Finds - ABC News",http://abcnews.go.com/Health/early-peanut-exposure-reduce-allergies-game-changer-study/story?id=29169847,"""Read the 'gredients!"" Jill Mindlin's daughter used to say when she was a toddler, running around the kitchen and holding up the food she wanted to eat.

At 3 years old, Maya already knew that if an adult didn't read the ingredients, she could have a deadly allergic reaction to the food she ate, Mindlin said. The first time Maya went into anaphylactic shock, she was just 9 months old, and doctors soon learned she was allergic to peanuts, tree nuts, eggs, dairy and sesame seeds. Like most parents, Mindlin wondered if it was her fault.

Peanut allergies in particular have doubled in the last 10 years, so a team of researchers with funding from the National Institutes of Health and the nonprofit group Food Allergy Research and Education set out to see whether early exposure to peanuts played a role in developing peanut allergies.

They followed hundreds of children from the time they showed a slight sensitivity to peanuts -- between 6 and 11 months old -- until they were 5 years old. Those who avoided peanuts were more likely to develop full-blown peanut allergies than those who didn't, according to the study published today in the New England Journal of Medicine.

Only 1.9 percent of those who were exposed to peanuts early developed the allergies compared with 13.7 of those who developed allergies after avoiding peanuts, the study showed.

Dr. Stacy Dorris, an allergist and immunologist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee, called the study ""exciting."" Dorris was not involved in the study, but said prior to 2008, parents were told to avoid feeding their children peanuts until they were about 2 years old. That year, evidence in Israel began to hint that perhaps early exposure to peanuts might prevent the allergies, she said.

""I think it's really going to be a game-changer for the allergy world,"" said Dr. Samuel Friedlander, an allergy and immunology specialist at the University Hospitals in Cleveland, who was not involved in the study. ""Up until now, we've been focused on diagnosis and management of children that have food allergies. This is the first randomized, controlled study that gives us evidence that we can prevent the occurrence of food allergies in kids. It would be much easier for us to be able to prevent the development of food allergies in the first place.""

Mindlin's daughter Maya is now nearly 14 years old and doing well. While any new research is positive, Mindlin said she has some advice to parents: Don't feel guilty.

""We were told for so many years to avoid the allergens, and now the science turns around 180 degrees,"" she said. ""You're darned if you do, you're darned if you don't. Let go of the guilt."""

Two armed security security guards told police they were traveling from Miami to Attleboro, Massachusetts along I-95 and pulled over in eastern North Carolina after experiencing mechanical problems, according to the Wilson County Sheriff's Office.

The pair was approached by three armed men driving a white van who ordered the men onto the ground, tied their hands behind their backs and made them walk into the woods, police said.

During that time, the suspects allegedly took gold and silver estimated to be worth more than $4,000,000, police said.

The security guards worked for TransValue Inc., a Florida-based shipping security company that ships goods for companies and banks working within the precious metals industry. The company's CEO Jesus Rodriguez confirmed the robbery to ABC News and said that an internal investigation is underway.

Rodriguez told ABC News there is now a $50,000 reward for information that leads to an arrest or recovery of the stolen property.

The FBI has been contacted and the investigation is ongoing.

1vv5gyH,2015-02-06 00:00:00,New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's Administration Facing New Criminal Investigation - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/jersey-gov-chris-christie-criminal-investigation/story?id=28753740,"Federal authorities have launched a criminal investigation into New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, as well as members of his administration, a man at the center of the investigation told ABC News.

The U.S. attorney’s office in New Jersey has interviewed former Hunterdon County Assistant Prosecutor Bennett Barlyn, who claims he was fired because he objected to Christie officials dismissing indictments against political allies of the governor. Barlyn confirmed the investigation to ABC News. It was first reported by the International Business Times.

“It is true,” Barlyn told ABC News, saying he was interviewed by federal authorities at his Pennsylvania home this week. “I also provided the investigators with names of people I thought could furnish firsthand information.”

Barlyn said he was not sure whether others have been questioned for the investigation.

Barlyn was dismissed from the Hunterdon County Prosecutor’s Office in September 2010 and later brought a whistleblower case against the Christie administration that currently is in the discovery phase. He has consistently said he was fired for objecting to the quashing of indictments against the county’s sheriff and two subordinates -- all political supporters of Christie’s.

The governor’s office previously has dismissed the accusations as being “conspiratorial nonsense.”

State officials have repeatedly denied Barlyn’s accusations and, in court filings, they said that the decision to dismiss the indictment was within the discretion of New Jersey’s top law-enforcement officials. They have argued Barlyn has no case and doesn’t even have the right to sue under state law.

The federal prosecutor's probe centers on why Christie’s then-attorney general, Paula Dow, dismissed the indictments.

Dow has rejected Barlyn's accusations, saying the indictment was flawed and Barlyn was fired for “legitimate business reasons,” according to NJ.com.

In a February 2014 interview, Barlyn outlined some of his grievances. He told ABC News' Jim Avila that all the evidence his former office obtained during its “two-year investigation was suddenly shipped back to [the state capital] Trenton. ... physically taken out of our office and taken to the attorney general's office.”

He called it “highly unusual,” adding, “The head of our special investigations unit who was heading the investigation was very abruptly taken off the case two weeks before the dismissal.”

Barlyn called the relationships between those being investigated and Christie “compelling,” adding “there’s simply photographic evidence” showing Christie “associating with these individuals.”

In the interview, Barlyn claimed he was fired for “political reasons.” He said the state attorney general gave him no explanation for his dismissal.

“I asked for one and was told that I wasn't entitled to an explanation,” Barlyn said. “I gave up my access to the building. I returned home again completely in the dark although I had a feeling of what precipitated the dismissal. My Internet connection to the office was cut off. And three weeks later I received a one-page faxed dismissal letter from the director of the Division of Criminal Justice. Again, no reason was given of why I was terminated after 18 years of being ... a state and county prosecutor with a pretty good rep.”

Barlyn added that he feels like he was “treated in a way that sent a message to my colleagues that if you complain, if you protest, if you see something wrong and speak out about it, you're going to punished. There's really no other explanation. I was afforded less due process than the criminals I prosecute for the most minor offenses. I wasn't allowed to give my side of the story. I wasn't allowed to justify what I did. I was simply hung out to dry in a very public fashion.”

Barlyn’s new meeting with investigators follows an April letter Barlyn wrote to New Jersey's U.S. attorney, Paul Fishman, telling him “we have no recourse left at the state level to expose this administration’s serious breach of the public trust.” Barlyn then asked Fishman to “open an investigation to explore any potential violations of the federal criminal code that may have occurred in connection with the Hunterdon matter,” adding he had “amassed a substantial body of documentation that corroborates the allegations of criminal wrongdoing by the state.”

In June, Fishman wrote to Barlyn asking him to be in touch with his office about the case, Barlyn said.

Fishman’s office will not comment on the case and Christie’s office did not immediately respond to request for comment, but the potential 2016 presidential candidate has long denied involvement in Barlyn’s termination.

Sources tell ABC News this new investigation is still in the early stages.

New Jersey’s U.S. attorney is also investigating the George Washington Bridge lane closures scandal that has jeopardized the governor’s political future. The Christie administration is also being investigated by the Manhattan District Attorney’s office, the Port Authority inspector general and a state legislative committee that is part of the Democratic-controlled New Jersey State Legislature.

1vVCrva,2015-03-02 00:00:00,U.S. Not Providing Air Support for Iraqi Push to Retake Tikrit From ISIS - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-providing-air-support-iraqi-push-retake-tikrit/story?id=29332144,"Iraq’s military has launched what it calls a major offensive to recapture Saddam Hussein's hometown of Tikrit from ISIS, but U.S. officials say there has been no coordination from the U.S. nor any requests for coalition airstrikes to support the operation.

On Sunday, Iraqi Prime Minister Al Abadi announced that the Iraqi military had launched a major operation to recapture the northern province of Saladin from ISIS. Tikrit is located 80 miles north of Baghdad and was seized by ISIS fighters last summer shortly after ISIS had taken over Mosul, Iraq’s second-largest city.

An Iraqi military spokesman told ABC News Monday that ISIS fighters were retreating from some areas in the province that had come under attack by Iraqi military forces. However, those claims could not be independently verified.

Iraqi state television reported that a large Iraqi military force had pushed into Saladin Province accompanied by Shiite and Sunni fighters and supported by Iraqi fighter jets. There have been unverified reports that the combined Iraqi force numbers as many as 30,000 Iraqi troops and militia fighters.

A U.S. official told ABC News that this appears to be more of a “tactical operation” and that Iraqi military elements involved do not appear to be well-coordinated.

""We were aware of the operation before it started,” Pentagon spokesman Col. Steve Warren told reporters Monday. “But I’m not going to details about what degree of coordination was involved in this.""

Another U.S. official said that the U.S. began monitoring Iraqi troop movements in the area last week, though it remains unclear how much advance information Iraq provided to American military officials.

Warren said U.S. and coalition aircraft are not providing airstrikes in support of the operation since Iraq did not request air support. A U.S. official told ABC News that the Iraqi Air Force and Army aviation are providing Iraqi troops with air cover for the operation.

Warren said the U.S. military mission in Iraq is to advise and assist Iraq's military in their fight against ISIS, but Iraq that decides the level of cooperation it wants.

A Shiite militia leader told the BBC that Iran's General Qasem Soleiman, the head of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard's Quds Force, was involved in the planning of the offensive. Officers of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards have been assisting the Iraqi military since last year and Iranian jets have conducted airstrikes against ISIS targets in eastern Iraq. Senior U.S. military officials have said repeatedly that there is no coordination with Iran in the fight against ISIS inside Iraq.

A U.S. official said Monday there appears to be Iranian involvement in the planning and execution of the Iraqi operation.

Warren noted that Iran has a great interest in the fight in Iraq, but he would not speak to the level of Iranian involvement.

Separately, Jordanian aircraft have now begun conducting airstrikes inside Iraq. Until now Jordan and four other Arab countries participating in the air campaign against ISIS had only launched airstrikes inside Syria. The expansion of Jordanian airstrikes into Iraq reflects Jordan's push to do more militarily against ISIS following the group's burning death of a captured Jordanian pilot last month."

The artist who painted the official portrait of President Bill Clinton that hangs in the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C. has revealed a surprise -- the portrait “subtly” incorporated Monica Lewinsky.

Artist Nelson Shanks says that the shadow on the left side of the portrait was cast by a mannequin in a blue dress -- a nod to the president’s affair with his 22-year-old intern.

“The blue dress itself doesn't appear in the painting,” Shanks told ABC News. “Only the shadow, which is symbolic of a shadow across the administration.”

Shanks, who described Clinton to the Philadelphia Daily News as “probably the most famous liar of all time,” says the former president never saw the shadow when he posed for the portrait in the Oval Office.

Shanks added the shadow in the painting later, in his Philadelphia studio.

“It was meant to be subtle and I think it is subtle,” he said. ""I mean, I am doing historical documents in a way.""

At the time of the portrait’s unveiling, Clinton thanked Shanks for the portrait, calling him a “great talent.”

The portrait is one of 55 Clinton portraits that are rotated at the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C.

The portrait is currently not on display, but it is in the museum’s gallery of collection.

A museum spokesperson told ABC News that they have not received any requests from the Clintons to remove the portrait.

The portrait originally stirred controversy when it was released in 2006 for the notable absence of a wedding ring on the President’s hand."

The horrific 5-minute video is evidence of ISIS' continued expansion from the terrorist group's ""caliphate"" from Syria and Iraq into neighboring regions.

The group, Tripoli Province, claimed it had kidnapped the men and published three pictures of them on January 12.

In the video, a group of men in orange jumpsuits are led along a beach, each accompanied by a masked militant. As the men in the jumpsuits kneel, one of the militants speaks to the camera in English, and then all of the kneeling men are beheaded.

After the release of the video, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi banned all travel by Egyptian citizens to Libya, promised to evacuate all Egyptians who are currently in the country.

The White House issued a statement tonight saying it condemns the ""despicable and cowardly murder,"" offering condolences to the families of the men and support to Egypt.

""ISIL's barbarity knows no bounds,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said. ""It is unconstrained by faith, sect, or ethnicity. This wanton killing of innocents is just the most recent of the many vicious acts perpetrated by ISIL-affiliated terrorists against the people of the region, including the murders of dozens of Egyptian soldiers in the Sinai, which only further galvanizes the international community to unite against ISIL.""

Counter-terrorism officials have expressed deep concern about ISIS asserting itself in Libya, where the U.S. is still reeling from the Sept. 11, 2012 attack on a diplomatic post in Benghazi that killed four Americans, including the U.S. Ambassador to Libya.

""They pretty much own Libya,"" an official involved in counter-terrorism operations told ABC News recently. ""We have zero collection there and zero authorities there.""

Another official referred to aspirational ISIS-produced maps showing their black jihadi flag representing the caliphate -- which was declared last summer by ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi -- enveloping much of the Middle East, Europe and North Africa and obliterating traditional borders. Their broad ambition is being realized in certain areas, the official said."

The driver was identified as Jose Alejandro Sanchez Ramirez, who had a valid commercial drivers license from Arizona, Oxnard Police Department Assistant Police Chief Jason Benites said.

Ramirez fled the scene but was found uninjured 1.6 miles away, and was not in the truck at time of collision, Benites said.

Police initially said the driver was arrested, but Benites said later he had been stopped but was not under arrest. This evening, however, Benites announced the arrest and charge.

Ramirez, 54, was driving a produce truck when he turned right onto the tracks, eventually getting stuck there, Benites said. Minutes after the crash, Benites added, an officer found the driver and said he looked disoriented.

The driver was taken to a hospital for observation.

Others injuries included people with head trauma and neck and back injuries who were taken to a hospital. Police said at least four people were critically injured, including the engineer. The conductor and another crew member were injured, treated and released from the hospital, officials said.

Metro-North Tragedy: How the Most Fatal Train Crash in Its History Unfolded

Reality Star's Mysterious Burbank Train Death

Nine patients, including three in critical condition, were taken to Ventura County Medical Center.

Dr. Bryan Wong, the medical director at the Ventura County Medical Center, told ABC News station KABC-TV in Los Angeles tone patient told him the impact was so violent and sudden they had no chance to brace themselves.

""He felt a violent jerking motion, couldn't grab on seat,"" Wong said. ""He was thrown against side of the train at that point.""

Another passenger, Joel Bingham, told KABC he was also thrown during the violent crash.

""I grabbed on to the pole and was flipping on the pole,"" Bingham told KABC. ""The lights went out. It seemed like slow motion. It seemed like it took forever.""

In addition to the 28 injured, another 23 passengers were on board who did not report being injured.

""We did what we could and we're lucky we survived,"" passenger Guy Basile told KABC.

Basile was not injured in the crash.

There have been no fatalities in the crash in which five train cars derailed and three were left on their side, according to Oxnard police. The train was heading toward downtown Los Angeles when it crashed.

Before hitting the truck, the train operator spotted the truck and applied the brakes, according to police. The train was traveling along 2 miles of flat railroad track so the truck was more easily visible.

The National Transportation Safety Board announced it will lead an investigation into the collision. At a news conference, NTSB board member Robert Sumwalt told reporters they are concerned about such collisions between trains and cars.

""Over 2,000 grade-crossing accidents every year, and there are about 250 fatalities, so this is something the NTSB is concerned about,"" Sumwalt told ABC when asked whether rail-crossing accidents are a widespread problem.

An NTSB spokesman confirmed they were sending investigators to the scene as well.

""This morning's accident on Metrolink's Ventura County Line is a tragedy and our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families,"" a spokesman for the Federal Railroad Administration said. ""Federal Railroad Administration investigators are en route to the scene, and they will conduct a thorough investigation to determine the factors that contributed to this accident. Safety must be every railroad's absolute top priority and we will establish what lapses, if any, occurred and order any necessary corrective actions.""

Oxnard is about 65 miles northwest of Los Angeles.

Deborah Hersman, the president of the National Safety Council and the former chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, said this type of railroad at-grade crossing has been the site of other train and vehicle collisions across the United States.

""I think we see way too many of these grade cross crashes across the U.S.,"" Hersman said. ""[We've] got to pay attention to this issue to prevent future fatalities and injuries.""

Ruzan Badalyan gave birth to Leo while in Armenia. Her husband, Samuel Forrest, told ABC News this week that she divorced him shortly after the boy's birth.

Badalyan wrote that she spent several hours after her son's birth trying to decide on his ""best destiny."" She said that Forrest accepted that their son's interest should be first and that ""only his move to another country could remedy the situation.""

Calls to Badalyan and Forrest have not yet been returned.

While Forrest said that his wife gave him an ultimatum after learning their son had Down syndrome, Badalyan said her husband did not support her while she weighed the decision.

""In the hardest moment of my life when my husband should be next to me and support and help to take the right decision, I could not find any support from his side,"" she wrote. ""After that incident, he left the hospital notifying me hours later that he was taking the kid with him, that he is going to leave the country for New Zealand and I do not have anything to do with the situation. Without giving me any option and trying to find with me any solution in this hardest situation, he started to circulate the story on every possible platform without even trying to give me a voice accusing that I put him an ultimatum marriage or the baby, which is absolutely not true. I tried several times to communicate but he never tried to listen me and to find common solutions. The only response was the accusation from his part.

Forrest, who plans to take Leo to his native New Zealand, said Badalyan filed for divorce one week after Leo's birth.

""Sam has never suggested joining him and bringing up the child together in his country,"" wrote Badalyan. ""Neither did he tell me anything on the day we filed for divorce. The only thing he kept saying was that he didn't want us to separate, whereas my question what we should do always remained unanswered.""

""As a mother who has faced this severe situation, being in the hospital under stress and depression, experiencing enormous pressure from every side, not finding any support from my husband’s part on any possibilities of giving a child decent life in Armenia, I faced two options: to take care of the child on my own in Armenia, or to abandon my maternal instincts and extend the baby an opportunity to enjoy a decent life with his father in New Zealand. I went for the second option,"" she continued.

“In this deadly 'Game of Thrones,' there is no place for America or for Israel. No place for Christians, Jews or Muslims,"" he said. ""So when it comes to Iran or ISIS the enemy of your enemy is your enemy.""

Netanyahu thanked lawmakers for decades of support and said Israelis were protected last summer from Hamas rocket attacks ""because this Capitol Dome helped build our Iron Dome.""

He then turned to Iran, warning that ""Iran's regime poses a great threat not only to Israel but also to the peace of the entire world.""

""Iran's regime is as radical as ever,"" Netanyahu said. ""This regime will always be an enemy of America.""

Netanyahu warned that if the Iran nuclear deal is accepted ""that deal will not prevent Iran from getting nuclear weapons,"" but ""it will guarantee"" Iran gets the bomb.

The Israeli prime minister heavily criticized a nuclear deal under negotiations between the United States, Iran and the other so-called P5+1 world powers.

""It doesn't block Iran's path to the bomb. It paves Iran's path to the bomb,"" he said.

Netanyahu called on Congress not to lift restrictions on Iran until Iran stops its aggression against its neighbors in the Middle East, stop supporting terrorism around the world, and stop threatening to annihilate Israel.

""For over a year we've been told that no deal is better than a bad deal,"" he said. ""Well this is a bad deal. A very bad deal. We're better off without it.""

Netanyahu said Israel can defend itself and promised to act unilaterally against Iran if necessary, though he believes the U.S. would stand with Israel.

""As prime minister of Israel, I can promise you more than one thing: even if Israel has to stand alone, Israel will stand,"" he said. ""I know that Israel does not stand alone! I know that America stands with Israel!"" he said. ""My friends, may Israel and America always stand together, strong and resolute. May we neither fear nor dread the challenges ahead. May we face the future with confidence, strength and hope.""

Dozens of Democrats skipped the address, although every seat on the floor and gallery was filled with more than 1,100 people listening to the prime minister in the chamber.

“I was near tears throughout the Prime Minister’s speech – saddened by the insult to the intelligence of the United States as part of the P5 +1 nations, and saddened by the condescension toward our knowledge of the threat posed by Iran and our broader commitment to preventing nuclear proliferation,” House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California, noted. “We have all said that a bad deal is worse than no deal, and stopping the spread of nuclear weapons is the bedrock of our foreign policy and national security.”

During his speech, Netanyahu acknowledged his speech has been ""subject of great controversy,"" but he said it was ""never my intention"" in accepting the invitation.

House Speaker John Boehner invited Netanyahu to address Congress without consulting the White House or Congressional Democrats shortly after the president delivered his State of the Union address.

Some Democrats had complained that the invitation was inappropriate given the Israeli elections just two weeks away, and a deadline to strike a nuclear deal with Iran that looms at the end of the month. Republicans however, contended that the invitation comes at a critical juncture in foreign policy.

“The Prime Minister’s address coincides with an increasingly aggressive Iranian campaign to expand its sphere of influence across the Middle East,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, said today. “It represents a threat to both our countries. It represents a threat to moderate Sunni allies, and it represents a threat to the international community at large. That’s why Prime Minister Netanyahu is here today.”"

“He is in a state of shock from the story and needs time to deal with all the pressure from the media,” the attorney, Salem al-Hashash, said.

Jasem Emwazi declined to comment to ABC News, the first Western news outlet to have met him since Mohammed was identified, in the attorney’s office. Emwazi, dressed in white, showed no emotion as he politely greeted ABC News reporters in Arabic, but said nothing else.

Al-Hashash said only Mohammed Emwazi’s father was questioned and not his mother, as had been previously reported. Kuwaiti authorities told ABC News Monday Jasem Emwazi had said his wife quickly recognized her son as the alleged killer from the first beheading video when it emerged online in August. Al-Hashash declined to confirm or deny that allegation.

Mohammed Emwazi, publicly identified last week as “Jihadi John,” is believed to have appeared in at least seven ISIS execution videos, several times apparently taking a knife to ISIS’s victims himself."
1vykGls,2015-03-02 00:00:00,'We Call It Life Row': Two of the Youngest US Women on Death Row Describe Life Behind Bars - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/US/call-life-row-youngest-us-women-death-row/story?id=29165934,"When Tiffany Cole and Emilia Carr walk down the hall in Florida’s Lowell Correctional Institution for Women together, they seem more like smiling girlfriends than convicted felons sitting on death row.

Cole is now 33, and Carr is now 30. Carr is the youngest woman in the United States sitting on death row, and Cole is the third youngest. The two women are behind bars for committing two separate crimes, and they had separate lives until they arrived as neighbors on the famous death row corridor at the women’s correctional facility in Ocala, Florida.

“We call it ‘life row,’” Carr said. “It’s life row ... because we’re not dying, we’re living.”

Carr, who is from Ocala, and Cole, from Jacksonville, Florida, share a similar path.

Prior to their incarcerations, neither had ever spent a night in jail, they said. Cole played the flute in high school, and participated in cheerleading and Girl Scouts. Carr was book smart and modeled, she said, and was in the school Marines, which was her high school's Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) program.

Both said they were sexually abused and got into trouble after they met the “wrong people.”

“[I was] looking for love in all the wrong places,” Cole said.

When she was 25 years old, Cole was convicted on murder charges after being connected to the death of her family’s neighbors, Reggie and Carol Sumner, who suffocated to death from dirt in their lungs when they were buried alive. She has acknowledged she helped dig a grave, but said she thought it would be to hide the items that she, her boyfriend, a guy she had known for three weeks and two of his friends had stolen from their victims. A psychiatrist at Cole’s trial said she suffered from mental problems and had a history of drug and alcohol abuse.

“I am not the same person anymore,” Cole said. “I have peace, I have joy. I have a sound mind.”

The jury was shown a damning photo of her celebrating after the crime was committed. She was given the death penalty, which she is in the process of appealing.

Carr was 26 years old and eight months pregnant with her boyfriend’s child when they were both convicted of suffocating his wife with duct tape and a plastic bag. Carr argued she left the scene before the woman was killed.

“Wouldn’t there have been physical evidence? I mean, duct tape is some sticky stuff, yet there’s no finger prints, no DNA, no hair,” Carr said.

But there is video of Carr being interviewing by police, recorded after her boyfriend confessed and implicated her in the crime. On the tape, Carr is heard telling an officer that the boyfriend asked her to “try to snap her neck,” and then Carr says, “I didn’t really try.”

She was convicted of capital murder and given the death penalty, which she is in the process of appealing.

Legal experts say the average appeals process takes 10 to 12 years for death row inmates. Carr has been on death row for four years, while Cole has been on death row for seven years.

Both women are reluctant to give details about their cases under appeal, but both insist the murders they were convicted of were done at the hand of their boyfriends, not them. Both say they are not arguing for their release, just for their lives, to have their executions stayed.

Both refuse to believe they will be executed.

“You can’t have that mentality, because that means you've accepted this,” Carr said.

“You've already died... you’re already dead,” if you accept that, Cole said.

In response to Cole appealing her conviction, the prosecutor who handled her case, Jay Plotkin, said in a statement to ABC News, “I was a prosecutor for more than 20 years. There was not any case that I prosecuted where the crime was more vile or cruel than the torture and murder of the Sumners. This case lingers on in the heart and soul of our community. Ms. Cole is certainly entitled to, and should, exhaust all of her legal rights to appeal. I am personally confident that she received more than adequate representation and a fair trial.”

The prosecutor in Carr’s case, Rock Hooker, declined to comment to ABC News while the appeals process was still pending.

According to the National Academy of Sciences, one in 25 people on death row is innocent."

Southwest grounded 128 planes -- about one-fifth of its fleet -- on Tuesday after discovering the missed inspections, airlines officials said.

According to a statement by the airline, the Boeing 737-700 jets were found to have overflown a required check.

After discovering the missed inspection, the airline notified federal safety regulators and developed a plan to complete the overdue checks. Southwest ended up canceling about 80 flights Tuesday as a result of the situation, the airline announced.

""The airline voluntarily removed these aircraft from service while the FAA works with Boeing and Southwest to evaluate a proposal that would allow the airline to continue flying the planes until the inspections are completed over the next few days,"" the FAA said in a statement.

Ted Cruz Would Deploy U.S. Troops Against ISIS ""If Need Be"" - ABC News",http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/This_Week/sen-ted-cruz-deploy-us-troops-isis/story?id=28812917,"Likely 2016 GOP presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said today he would take put U.S. troops on the ground in the fight against ISIS if it was necessary to ""accomplish the mission.""

""The mission should be defeating ISIS before they succeed in carrying out more horrific acts of terror, before they succeed in murdering Americans. If need be, we should go that step,"" Cruz told ""This Week"" anchor George Stephanopoulos when asked whether U.S. troops on the ground should be considered.

Cruz's answer echoed that of fellow GOP hopeful, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who said last Sunday on ""This Week"" that he ""wouldn't rule out"" deploying American troops in the fight against ISIS.

Cruz, however, emphasized that the first steps in combating the terror group should be arming the forces already battling ISIS on the ground, and stepping up the severity of air strikes.

""We need to arm the Kurds and we need to use the Peshmerga as boots on the ground. They're effective. They're ready. They're our close allies and we need to use that in close coordination with overwhelming air power to take out ISIS,"" Cruz said. ""We've seen essentially photo-op foreign policy, where we drop a bomb here or a missile there.""

With ISIS and al Qaeda also posing a threat to the U.S. homeland, Stephanopoulos asked Cruz about GOP efforts to block funding of the Department of Homeland Security to stop President Obama's executive orders on immigration.

Earlier this week, House Speaker John Boehner called out the Texas senator by name, urging him and other Republican senators to join the effort to block funding of the executive actions, saying ""We won this fight in the House. Now the fight must be won in the United States Senate.""

""It's time for Senator Cruz and Senator [Jeff] Sessions and Senate Republicans and Senate Democrats to stand with the American people and to block the president's actions,"" Boehner said Tuesday.

But on Sunday, Cruz denied responsibility for the plan to block DHS funding, saying it was the strategy of House leaders.

""This was not my plan. This was leadership's plan. This was the Cromnibus, which you'll recall in December, I fought vigorously against it. I said, this plan doesn't make sense. It gives away all our leverage, and it's a plan that is designed to fail. So, I would ask leadership, this is their plan they designed. Let's see what their next step is,"" Cruz said.

""And Republicans, what we need to do is we need to honor the commitment we made to the voters, and that means we need to fund DHS and we also need to act effectively to stop President Obama's illegal and unconstitutional executive amnesty,"" Cruz added.

Looking ahead to a potential presidential primary race that could see him going against former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Cruz said Republican voters want a candidate ""who will stand up and lead"" and who has demonstrated a commitment to conservative values."
1vZnFUj,2015-03-03 00:00:00,Ferguson Shooting: Federal Investigation Expected to Show Pattern of Discrimination at Police Department - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/ferguson-shooting-federal-investigation-expected-show-pattern-discrimination/story?id=29361802,"The Department of Justice is expected to release its finding on the investigation into the Ferguson Police Department as early as Wednesday, sources tell ABC News.

According to a law enforcement official, the report will say the Ferguson Police Department’s conduct routinely violated the constitution and federal law due to a combination of racial bias and a focus on generating revenue.

According to the findings, African-Americans make up 67 percent of the population of Ferguson, but were subject to 85 percent of traffic stops, 90 percent of citations and 93 percent of arrests.

In essence they accuse the Ferguson police department of a pattern and practice of discrimination.

The Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division found multiple examples of police and municipal court officials exhibiting racial bias in emails sent on official Ferguson accounts.

Examples include a November 2008 email which stated that President Barack Obama would not be president for very long because “what black man holds a steady job for four years.” Another racist email from May 2011 stated: “An African-American woman in New Orleans was admitted into the hospital for a pregnancy termination. Two weeks later she received check for $5,000. She phoned the hospital to ask who it was from. The hospital said, ‘Crimestoppers.’”

From April to September 2014, 95 percent of people held at the Ferguson jail longer than two days were African American.

African Americans accounted for 95 percent of all “Manner of Walking in Roadway” -- essentially jaywalking -- charges, 94 percent of “failure to comply” charges and 92 percent of all “peace disturbance” charges."
1vzYz9d,2015-02-17 00:00:00,'American Sniper' Trial: Accused Shooter Told Cops He Knew It Was Wrong - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/US/american-sniper-trial-accused-shooter-told-cops-knew/story?id=29006250,"Accused “American Sniper” killer Eddie Ray Routh was shown saying he had killed two men and that he knew it was wrong in a recording of the police interrogation aired in court Monday afternoon.

The nearly hour-long tape showed Texas Ranger Danny Briley interrogating Routh on the evening of Feb. 2, 2013, shortly after he allegedly shot and killed former Navy Seal Chris Kyle and Kyle’s friend Chad Littlefield.

""I knew if I didn't take his soul, he was going take mine next,” Routh said to the police interrogator on the recording. “I'm just tired of playing chess with my life.”

When directly asked whether he knew what he did was wrong, Routh said: “Yes, sir.”

""I was reasonable and fair with them boys. You know, they looked at me in the eyes. I looked at them in the eyes,” he said.

Routh, who is now 27, said that the men “talked to me pretty sh***y” while at the gun range where they incident occurred and said the shooting was at “3:00 or so.”

He said he shot Kyle first, and that was the only one of the two victims that he was able to identify.

""I was right up close to them. I didn't mean to be so close,"" he said.

Routh’s attorney has entered a plea that his client is not guilty by reason of insanity. In order for that to be legally accepted, it has to be clear that he did not know what he was doing was wrong at the time of the shooting. The police interrogation, which was presented as part of the prosecution’s evidence, indicates that he knew it was wrong.

When the ranger asked whether there was anything he wanted to say to the families of his victims, Routh said: ""I'm just sorry for what I've done, once the word gets out.""

In the footage, Routh is seen sitting in a swivel chair with his hands handcuffed behind his back.

At points, he lays his head down on a table.

He is seen wearing a striped polo-style shirt and cowboy boots that were entered into evidence today. The ranger asks whether he noticed the blood on his boots and Routh is seen looking down at the shoes.

""The way he would talk in my opinion was very philosophical,” Ranger Briley said in court, “and, yes, some of the stuff I had no clue what he was talking about.”"
1w6YS0A,2015-03-05 00:00:00,Boston Marathon Bombing: Inside Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's 'It Was Him' Defense Strategy - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/US/boston-marathon-bombing-inside-dzhokhar-tsarnaevs-defense-strategy/story?id=29405323,"The trial of alleged Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev enters its second day today, but the defense has already made a curiously blunt admission: ""It was him.""

One of the first things Tsarnaev's attorney Judy Clarke told the court Wednesday was that he was responsible for the ""senseless, horrific, misguided acts."" The defense would only contest the ""why"" of it all, she said, indicating it was Tsarnaev's late older brother, Tamerlan, who pushed her client down the dark path.

The defense's move surprised many federal officials who said today they are asking why a court should spend potentially months proving what the defense has already admitted.

Legal experts told ABC News that while the defense's strategy may appear odd from the outside, that's only because they're not focusing on winning this phase of the trial, but avoiding the death penalty later.

""Given the amount of evidence the government has, I would suggest it's the only strategy,"" said Robert Bloom, a Boston College law professor. ""I think their objective is to develop a rapport with the jury. They certainly don't want to go and cross examine victims very hard. By developing a rapport with the jury, when their turn comes to talk about the death penalty phase of it, they will have a rapport with the same jurors that are hearing all this evidence.""

Charles Ogletree, Professor of Law at Harvard Law School, agreed.

""Their point is there's no question that what he did was wrong, being involved in the marathon bombing, but they're also saying that life imprisonment is enough punishment that would appropriate,"" he said.

So why not just plead guilty to the 30 charges related to the bombing in the first place?

First, Olgetree said the defense likely lobbied for a deal in which Tsarnaev pleaded guilty to avoid the death penalty, but the government didn't go for it -- potentially under pressure from the Obama administration, after Attorney General Eric Holder authorized the government to seek the death penalty last January.

""So they don't think life imprisonment is justified, is not enough,"" Ogletree said.

""They're not taking the death penalty off the table for [Tsarnaev],"" ABC News legal analyst Dan Abrams said on ""Good Morning America,"" noting that in most cases prosecutors would have gone for such a deal.

So there was little incentive for the defense to plead guilty now.

Second, Bloom said that by pleading not guilty, the defense is preserving its right to an appeal should it choose so later on.

Ogletree said he thinks the defense's strategy is a good one and that they will accomplish what they set out to.

""I think it's a strategy that's going to work,"" he said. ""Now that you're going to trial, having to make sure that [you're] looking around and you're saying that my client is guilty of what he's done. He's guilty of his crimes. And he needs to be punished. The punishment has to fit the crime... Life imprisonment is a very serious punishment.""

Graphic, Emotional Testimony

As Tsarnaev sat impassively in court Wednesday, the court was shown for the first time new videos from the day of the blast.

One, shot by a bystander, showed the horror and chaos in the immediate aftermath of the blasts, as emergency responders attempted to prioritize those who needed help the most and family members frantically searched for their loved ones. Another video from inside a nearby sports store showed people ripping clothes of the racks to use as makeshift tourniquets for the injured.

""It's hard reliving the situation, and the circumstances that happened that day, when we mentioned the ones that we lost that day, the ones that really should be remembered,"" said Marc Fucarile who was at the race.

Similar testimony is expected today, potentially with other new videos that captured the horrific event."

But a State Department spokesperson told ABC News it will be ""several months"" before the emails are released, because the department will need time to review the emails and remove sensitive and personal information.

“I want the public to see my email. I asked State to release them. They said they will review them for release as soon as possible,” Clinton wrote on Twitter Wednesday night..

State Department deputy spokeswoman Marie Harf, in a statement that followed Clinton's tweet, said the department is focused on reviewing Clinton's emails.

""The State Department will review for public release the emails provided by Secretary Clinton to the Department, using a normal process that guides such releases,” the statement reads. “We will undertake this review as quickly as possible; given the sheer volume of the document set, this review will take some time to complete.”

Clinton’s team submitted 55,000 pages of emails to the State Department, but an unknown number of emails that do not pertain to work will not be turned over, a Clinton aide told ABC News.

The storage of Clinton’s email has come under scrutiny after a New York Times report revealed she used a personal, non-governmental email address to conduct official business as secretary of state. The Associated Press reported Tuesday Clinton used a personal server based in her New York home to host her emails.

Clinton, 67, used only one email address during her tenure, her attorney David Kendall wrote in an email to the House Select Committee, which is tasked with investigating the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi,Libya. The committee sent subpoenas to the State Department Wednesday requesting all of Clinton's communications related to Libya.

“The Select Committee on Benghazi today issued subpoenas for all communications of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton related to Libya and to the State Department for other individuals who have information pertinent to the investigation,” Jamal Ware, communications director for the committee, wrote in a statement. “The Committee also has issued preservation letters to internet firms informing them of their legal obligation to protect all relevant documents.”

The email account that Clinton used while working at the State Department was hdr22@clintonemail.com and was traced to a server based out of Chappaqua, New York, where she and former President Bill Clinton have a home, ABC News confirmed.

ABC News also learned that another email domain, wjcoffice.com, which used the former president's initials as their descriptor, was also based out of Chappaqua. That domain was registered by an individual called Eric Hoteham, the same name used to register the clintonemail.com domain.

Clinton has yet to explain why she used her own server and personal email, instead of a State Department email address to comply with federal record-keeping requirements.

That's the advice, according to the world's oldest person, Misao Okawa, who turned 117 today.

Okawa, who was born in 1898 to a kimono maker, celebrated her birthday early on Wednesday at the Kurenai Nursing home in Osaka, Japan.

She donned a pink kimono with cherry blossom prints and a pink daisy pin in her hair.

And, of course, there was cake.

Asked for the secret to her long life, Okawa teased, ""I wonder about that too."" She's previously said the key is eating sushi and getting enough sleep, Guinness World Records reported.

The 117-year-old eats three large meals a day and makes sure she sleeps eight hours a night,Guinness World Records said, adding the nursing home's manager Tomohito Okada said her favorite meal is sushi, particularly mackerel on vinegar-steamed rice.

Okawa said she was ""very happy"" to be 117, though her time ""seemed rather short"" when Osaka government official Takehiro Ogura asked how she felt about living for 117 years. Ogura gave Okawa a big bouquet to mark the day.

In addition to holding the title of ""world's oldest person,"" Okawa is also one of few people who can call themselves a supercentenarian, a person 110-years-older or older.

""Reaching this age is an exceptional achievement, especially given the average life span for women in Japan is just under 85.9 years,"" Guinness World Records said.

""Misao has lived across three centuries,"" Guinness World Records added, ""which have seen immense social and technological advances including the advent of motor vehicles, flight, mobile telephones, social networking sites and six UK monarchs, four emperors of Japan and 20 US presidents.""

Okawa married her husband Yukio in 1919, and they had two daughters and one son. She now has four grandchildren and six great-grandchildren. Her husband died in 1931.

The verdict, released today, comes after a second jury considered her case because the first jury, which convicted her of murder two years ago, could also not agree on whether to sentence her to death.

Now that this second jury was hung, Judge Sherry Stephens is tasked with deciding Arias' sentence: whether she will be in prison for life or have the possibility for parole after 25 years. The death penalty is no longer a possibility.

Arias appeared in court beside her lawyers looking stoic and expressing no emotion. There were audible sobs from the audience in the courtroom, however, which appeared to come from one of Travis Alexander's sisters, who testified during the original trial.

Arias was found guilty in May 2013 for killing her on-off boyfriend Alexander after a lengthy trial.

Her first case gained national attention as the testimony was live-streamed and she shared extensive, explicit details about her alleged sexual encounters with Alexander that led up to her stabbing him multiple times in the shower at his Arizona home in 2008.

The trial jury found her guilty of first-degree murder but deadlocked on whether to sentence her to life in prison or death.

A second jury, which was handed the case on Feb. 25, was called in for the penalty retrial with cameras prohibited after the spectacle of the first. The judge had ruled that the announcement of the decision would be televised, however.

Another difference from the first trial came in the form of Arias' participation, or lack thereof. The now-34-year-old photographer testified for 18 days during the first trial but she never took the stand in her retrial."

“I didn’t want to do this,” Morgan Geyser is heard telling a police officer on an interrogation tape. “I was afraid of what would happen if I didn’t... I didn’t want to find out what would happen if we didn’t.”

Morgan Geyser and Anissa Weier, both now 13, were arrested on May, 31, 2014, after allegedly stabbing their then-12-year-old friend Payton Leutner 19 times and leaving her to die in the woods in their hometown of Waukesha, Wisconsin. But after being rushed to the hospital with life threatening injuries, Payton survived.

The police interrogation tapes, which were recorded mere hours after both girls were arrested, were shown at a pre-trial hearing for the girls this week.

“20/20” has been following the case since it began more than eight months ago. This past May, Payton Leutner went to a sleepover with her friend Morgan, and another girl, Anissa, to celebrate Morgan’s birthday.

After her arrest, Morgan told police that Payton was her “only friend for a long time.”

“She was my best friend since fourth grade,” Morgan is heard telling the officer on the interrogation tape.

But when the officer asked Morgan why she decided to hurt Payton, Morgan replied, “it was necessary” to please “Slender Man.”

Both Morgan and Anissa were obsessed with the fictional character, who is often depicted in fan fiction stories online as a horror figure who stalks children. In court this week, disturbing drawings depicting Slender Man and dismembered Barbie dolls recovered from Morgan’s bedroom were shown.

When asked to describe ""Slender Man,"" Morgan told the detective on the interrogation tape that he was “a tall, faceless man who preys on children.”

“He watches you,” she added. “I’ve never seen him. He’s everywhere.”

In the interrogation video, the then-12-year-old Anissa said, “He can be anywhere from 6 feet to 14 feet tall... he doesn’t have a face, his skin is white and at his own will he can um like exploit these tendrils from his back and um like strangle his victims.”

Anissa is heard telling police that Morgan suggested they go in search of Slender Man and become his “proxies.”

“Morgan said, ‘Hey Anissa we should be proxies,’ I was like, ‘OK, how would we do that?’” Anissa is heard telling a police officer.

Authorities say Morgan repeatedly told detectives it was “necessary” to kill Payton to become “proxies” of Slender Man and live with him in his mansion in the woods.

They believed his mansion was in the Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest in northern Wisconsin. Morgan told police their plan to kill their friend began as early as December 2013.

Anissa told detectives she was excited when Morgan told her of the plan to stab Payton.

“I was excited because I wanted proof that he existed because there were a bunch of skeptics out there saying he didn’t exist,” she said. “Morgan and I were going to be like lionesses chasing down a zebra. I was going to tackle her and then Morgan was going to do the stabbing.”

Anissa also told the detective that it was Morgan who convinced her that she had to kill or else Slender Man would ""kill my whole family in three seconds.""

Police said when the girls were caught in 2014, they were carrying clothes, granola bars and water bottles. One of the girls was carrying a picture of her family, telling police she wanted to remember what they looked like after leaving her town for Slender Man’s imaginary mansion in the woods.

The girls told police they left Payton to die in the woods, lying to her and saying that help was on the way. Instead they began their journey to find Slender Man’s mansion.

On the interrogation tape, Anissa described how she felt about Slender Man when they were apprehended, saying, ‘I’m scared. ... I was told if I didn’t do something...my family would be in danger.'”

Both girls have been charged with one count of first-degree intentional attempted homicide. They have not entered pleas. Anissa and Morgan appeared in court this week before a judge who will decide whether to try the girls as adults or send their cases to a juvenile court. That judge’s decision is expected in March.

“I honestly don’t know why we did this,” Morgan said."

The three school friends from East London’s Bethnal Green, ages 15 to 16, left their homes before 8 a.m. local time Tuesday and met at Gatwick Airport near London where they boarded a Turkish Airlines flight, according to a police news release.

""Please come home Amira, everyone is missing you. You are strong, smart, beautiful and we are hoping you will make the right decision,"" the statement added. ""We miss you more tha[n] you can imagine. We are worried and we want you to think about what you have left behind.""

Added the family of Shamima Begum, 15, in its statement: ""We miss you terribly and are extremely worried about you. Please, if you hear this message, get in touch and let us know you are safe. We want you home with us. You belong at home with us.

""Syria is a dangerous place and we don't want you to go there,"" the statement continued. ""Get in touch with the police and they will help to bring you home. You are not in any trouble.""

The family of 16-year-old Kadiza Sultana also issued a statement, asking that she return ""safe and sound.""

""In your absence, we, as a family, are feeling completely distressed and cannot make sense of why you left home,"" the statement read. ""Things have not been the same without you.""

Britain’s Counter-Terrorism Commander Richard Walton said they were reaching out to Abase, Begum and Sultana using Turkish and social media. Should the girls see news reports about themselves, Walton said he hopes they’ll listen to such a “direct appeal.”

“Clearly if these three girls travel to Syria, they’re in grave danger,” he said. “We are aware as many people of the treatment of girls and women currently in that part of Syria. You know the prospect is not good and we want to prevent them from getting there.”

Statements attributed to one major terror group in the region, ISIS, purportedly described the way its fighters treat women -- from buying and selling young girls as slaves to justifying rape of “non-believers.”

The U.S Senior Adviser for Foreign Fighters, Ambassador Thomas Krajeski, said during a news briefing Friday that young girls traveling to Syria and Iraq were being considered as problematic as those traveling to fight.

“Fighters include people not only picking up a gun, but also going to support Islamists, in some way, including young women who have been attracted to the fight for various reasons and in some cases children,” he said, adding the prospect of fighters returning to their home countries to conduct attacks is of “great concern.”

Krajeski also acknowledged the difficulty of controlling the Turkish-Syrian border.

“This is a very difficult border to police,” he said. “The most effective way to do it is to provide border officials with the best possible information. I believe Turks are committed to increasing checks and controls of incoming travelers and border controls.”

At the Scotland Yard briefing, officials said the case of the three missing girls was related to one concerning another 15-year-old girl who was stopped by police in December while allegedly trying to get to Syria to join ISIS. Officials said the three missing girls were friends with the 15-year-old."

The declaration fulfills a legal obligation that will allow efforts to proceed with compensation claims -- but also marks a somber development for relatives of the plane’s passengers and crew, who’ve waited nearly 11 months for answers about the plane’s fate.

“With the heaviest heart and the deepest sorrow ... we officially declare Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 an accident,” he said.

“It is nonetheless important that families try to resume normal lives, or as normal a life as may be possible after this sudden loss,” he said. “Without in any way intending to diminish the feelings of the families, it is hoped that this declaration will enable the families to obtain the assistance they need, in particular through the compensation process.”

The flight was carrying 239 people en route from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing, when it disappeared off radar after midnight on March 8. Authorities believe that the plane turned west and crossed Malaysia and then headed south, flying until its fuel was exhausted and crashing somewhere in the southern Indian Ocean.

Search crews have scoured the South China Sea, the Straits of Malacca, the Andaman Sea and southern Indian Ocean, but no physical evidence from the plane has emerged.

Mardjono SiswoSumarno, chief investigator at the National Transportation Safety Committee, said the cockpit voice recording indicated that the co-pilot, French national Remi Emmanuel Plesel, was flying the plane while Indonesian Capt. Iriyanto was monitoring.

Iriyanto, who uses one name, was a former fighter pilot with more than 20,500 flying hours, while the less-experienced Plesel had about 6,000 hours.

Radar data showed the plane was climbing at an abnormally high rate -- 3,000 feet in 30 seconds -- prior to the crash, before stalling and plunging into the Java Sea, authorities have said.

More than 70 victims’ bodies have been recovered from the wreckage of AirAsia Flight 8501. Earlier this week, Indonesia’s military halted its recovery efforts, including attempts to locate more bodies and raise the fuselage from the sea.

The Indonesian Search and Rescue Agency, however, is continuing to look for victims with its own ships and helicopters.

“We can confirm that there was a shooting incident at North Kabul International Airport complex 29 January at approximately 6:40 p.m. [local time],"" according to the U.S. military in Afghanistan. ""Three coalition contractors were killed as was an Afghan local national.""

The three Defense Department contractors were Americans, a U.S. official said, noting that the shooter was wearing the uniform of an Afghan national policeman, but it was unclear if he was actually a member of the Afghan security forces or not. The shootings were on the civilian side of the airport, the official said.

The incident is under investigation, the official said, adding that it is also unclear if the Afghan listed as a fatality is someone other than the shooter who was shot dead by the security team at the airport."

Sarah Palin.

WALLACE: So far, it's more of a media problem than a political problem. It furthers the media narrative that the Clintons play by their own rules and think that records laws and transparency are for the rest of us, not for them. It remains to be seen whether this will become a political problem for her.

Q: Would Hillary Clinton – should she run -- benefit from a primary challenge? Do you see any Democrats actually posing a threat to her?

WALLACE: Everyone benefits (operationally) from a primary. So far, the talk and energy seems to center around Elizabeth Warren. A contest between HRC and Warren would be interesting. Warren is to the Democratic base what Obama was eight years ago: the candidate who speaks to their hearts, while Clinton seems to be the candidate who speaks to their heads. It's always easier in a primary to be the heart candidate.

Q: Politico’s Jim VandeHei, when asked to predict the 2016 Republican nominee earlier this year, said Jeb Bush. Now you used to work for Jeb Bush, but how do you see the 2016 Republican field right now? Is there a clear front-runner in your mind? Anyone you think we should be watching closely?

WALLACE: At this point, it's an incredible burden to be the front-runner. The media beats up on you, the right-wing of the party attacks you relentlessly on talk radio and members of your own party who covet your front-runner status are trying to knock you down. For those who can survive this pre-primary, it will bode well for the next phase of the campaign when you actually go before voters. Jeb is in a strong position for this phase, as is Scott Walker. And I wouldn't count Chris Christie or Rand Paul out either.

Q: Having been a part of the 2008 McCain campaign, what is one piece of advice you’d give to a Republican hoping to reach the White House this time around?

WALLACE: It's more important to be correct on the substance than it is to master the pace of the Twitterverse in terms of responding to controversy, so when things go wrong, shut off your phones, catch your breath and think before you speak.

Q: Sarah Palin has not ruled out a 2016 presidential run. Do you think she has any actual interest in running and, more broadly, what do you make of her place in the Republican Party?

WALLACE: I have no idea where her interests lie but she will always have a following."

Recovery teams picked up American Troy Bradley and Russian Leonid Tiukhtyaev on Saturday morning and took them to shore, the Two Eagles Balloon team said. The pilots had a ""controlled descent to a gentle water landing,"" about four miles off the coast.

""They are fine, but are being checked out onshore by paramedics as a precaution,"" according to the Two Eagles Balloon team.

Bradley's and Tiukhtyaev's trip - which began in Japan - lasted 160 hours, and 38 minutes, besting the absolute world record for time aloft for gas balloons of 137 hours, 5 minutes and 50 seconds. They traveled a total of 6,646 miles, better than the previous record of 5,209 miles.

""This project has been alive longer than I have,"" Bradley's 15-year-old daughter Savannah told ABC News today. ""This idea came about very soon before I was born. And then the first attempt was in 2008 but they never found the right weather. They wanted to make sure everything would go smoothly and it definitely would be successful. We're very thankful that they waited until now to find the correct weather window.""

Savannah and her mother went to Japan last week to watch the expedition begin.

""I thought I would be more relieved when he launched. But it was a lot more emotional of a time than I had ever imagined it to be,"" Savannah said. ""It was just hard to see him go.""

During the flight, Savannah said she was able to call and text her father through a satellite service.

""It was very stressful while he was in the air,"" Savannah said. ""Because I was always worried something would go wrong.""

Earlier in the trip, Bradley told Mission Control he was ""not nervous at all about the mission,"" according to the Two Eagles Balloon team, but Savannah says she was relieved today when the balloon landed.

""It was very stressful when they were coming into landing because my dad was very tired,"" Savannah added. ""We were all ready for him to land. He was physically tired because it had been a long trip and I was just really relieved once we finally knew he was down and safe.

""I'm very happy and relieved that it's over and my dad's biggest dream has finally been fulfilled,"" she said.

Although the two pilots say they were in the air for longer than the duration record of 137 hours, the record has not been officially broken. This will determined by the U.S. National Aeronautic Association and FAI after a long process of documentation and review that can take up to several weeks, or even months.

Roy Blunt of Missouri does not regret signing the open letter to Iran’s leaders warning of the limits of a nuclear deal with the Obama administration, unlike some of his Republican Senate colleagues.

“I really don’t,” Blunt told ABC’s George Stephanopoulos on “This Week” today when asked whether he had any second thoughts on the letter.

Tom Cotton Denies GOP Letter Undermines Iran Nuclear Talks

Why Some Think 47 GOP Senators Broke the Law With Iran Letter

Netanyahu Speech: Iran Engaged in Deadly 'Game of Thrones'

The letter, an effort led by freshman Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, was signed by 47 Republican senators including several potential GOP presidential candidates. It said that an agreement between the U.S. and Iran not ratified by Congress should be considered an executive action any future president could revoke.

Several GOP signees, including Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Ron Johnson, R-Wis., have walked back their support for the tactic after the negative response in Washington and across the country.

But Blunt said the letter was “essentially an op-ed,” expressing the Senate’s role in treaty negotiations.

“There is a constitutional role here for the Senate if you want this agreement to be permanent, binding and long-term,” he said on “This Week.”

When asked whether the letter hurts the administration’s ability to broker further international sanctions against Iran, Blunt said, “No deal is better than a bad deal.

“I think these negotiations have gone in a dramatically bad direction,” Blunt added.
Secretary of State John Kerry is set to arrive in Switzerland for the latest round of nuclear negotiations with Iran’s foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif.

On Saturday, White House chief of staff Denis McDonough sent a letter to Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker, the Republican chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, warning against congressional action that would interfere with negotiations.

Corker, who did not sign Cotton’s letter, has introduced bipartisan legislation to increase congressional oversight of nuclear negotiations and require the president to submit any nuclear deal to Congress for review and approval."

The power forward and center has been named to 10 All-Star teams and won two championships during his NBA career.

But the ovation he received Monday – a thundering standing ovation – wasn’t for basketball success, but merely surviving.

Bosh, 30, spent time with his Miami Heat teammates Monday, his first encounter with the team since being diagnosed last month with blood clots in his lungs, a condition that threatened his life.

“Myself, my wife, Dwyane [Wade] and Gabrielle [Union] all went to Haiti. I pretty much suffered for two days. On, you know, the third day, we came back and I went right to the doctor’s office,” Bosh said.

He later checked himself into the hospital, where he finally learned the severity of his situation. The blood clots had traveled from his calf to his lungs, a condition that kills 100,000 Americans each year, often people with poor circulation such as the elderly or the very tall. The same condition killed former NBA star Jerome Kersey the same week.

These days, Bosh is homebound with his wife and three children. His physical exertion is limited, and he only recently started driving around the block. He’s realistic about his circumstances, but hopeful he can resume his career next season.

At this point, Bosh is scheduled to resume full basketball activities in September, putting him on target for a healthy return in 2015-16.

Bosh was thankful to return to the American Airlines Arena Monday.

""All the love and energy has really, really allowed me to be back here,"" Bosh said. ""Not under the circumstances I want to be, but beggars can't be choosers. Very happy to be here and I'm doing a lot better.""

As of 11 p.m. ET Saturday, airlines had canceled 1,048 flights scheduled for Sunday. Of those, 445 were flights out of Chicago's O'Hare International Airport.

The developing winter storm was moving through the southern and central Plains today, bringing a mixture of snow, sleet, freezing rain, and rain to the region.

Winter storm warnings, watches, and advisories were currently in effect around midday Saturday from the central Plains to New England in anticipation of the winter storm on the way.

The upcoming storm was expected to strengthen Saturday evening with a large area of heavy snow developing across the central Plains, and eventually through the Midwest Saturday night and early Sunday morning.

The heaviest snow is expected to fall generally along and north of Interstate 80, with a wintry mix and rain expected for areas south of there.

On Sunday morning, heavy snow is forecast to be falling from Des Moines, Iowa, to Chicago and as far east as Detroit and Cleveland.

By Sunday evening, the snow will continue to fall from Chicago to Cleveland and begin to move into the Northeast. A wintry mix and areas of heavy rain are expected further south from Indianapolis to the northern Tennessee Valley.

Current snowfall forecasts from the ABC Weather Team call for accumulations of 8-12 inches from central Iowa through the northern Ohio Valley by Monday morning. Isolated amounts over a foot are possible, focusing on areas east of Chicago through northern Ohio.

This storm will continue to track east Sunday night and into Monday morning impacting a large stretch of the I-95 corridor from Washington, D.C to coastal Maine.

From Washington, D.C. to Philadelphia, mixing with rain and sleet will lead to lower snow totals. However from New York City up to Boston, significant amounts of snow with an icy and dangerous Monday morning commute expected."

Speaking from Baghdad, al-Abadi called ISIS ""a very, very dangerous organization."" The terror group has millions of Iraqi citizens living in areas under its control.

""If they are not stopped on time, I can assure you, no army in the region can stand in their own way,” he told ABC News' Martha Raddatz. ""We have to stop them for our own sake.""

Earlier this week, the Iraqi government launched its largest military offensive yet against ISIS in an attempt to retake Tikrit, which was seized by the group last summer.

Al-Abadi said Iraqi troops are “ahead of planning” in their push towards the city and preparing for an urban fight. While headed for meetings in Iraq this week, Gen. Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, expressed optimism that the Iraqi force of 23,000 military and Shiite militia fighters will defeat the several hundred ISIS fighters inside the city.

There is no U.S. involvement in the Tikrit offensive and U.S. officials have said the Iraqis have not requested airstrikes to support the operation.

Instead, the offensive has been helped by Iranian planning and Iranian-backed Shiite militias. Al-Abadi did not say if Iranian Quds Force General Qasem Soleimani was playing a major role in the operation.

Al-Abadi acknowledged that Soleimani “comes and goes” to Iraq, but that he does not stay long.

""He just comes for a visit and he goes,"" he said.

Al-Abadi added that he had not personally seen Soleimani during a visit earlier this week to Samarra in Saladin Province, close to the fighting.

Al-Abadi said it was “not entirely true” that American military commanders did not know beforehand that the Iraqi military was launching the Tikrit offensive, noting that the U.S. and Iraqi military coordinate plans at a Baghdad Joint Operations Center.

“I know probably some are surprised and unhappy in - in Washington - because they haven't taken a full control over these operations,” he said. “We have to take charge of what we are doing because it's Iraqi lives which has been sacrificed.”

Al-Abadi said Iran is helping Iraq ""in a lot of ways,"" including providing military advisers for the offensive on Tikrit, adding that Iran too feels threatened by ISIS. He said that overall the number of Iranian advisers inside Iraq “is not more than 50 or 60.”

Al-Abadi claimed the U.S. does not see the Iranian help as a problem as the Iraqis have “the right to use all capabilities available to defend our own forces, our own land.”

The U.S. currently has 2,600 military personnel in Iraq to advise and train Iraq’s military, but al-Abadi did not expect them to someday be needed in combat operations.

“It doesn't help whether I wish or not. I don't think that's going to happen,” he said. “This administration and I understand the U.S. public are not eager - or they don't want to - send their own sons and troops outside [the] U.S.”

The Iraqi prime minister said the country's military plans to push ISIS out of other areas of Iraq, including Anbar Province, before trying to retake Iraq’s second largest city, Mosul.

Though he expects an Iraqi offensive on Mosul to take place in early summer ""just to repay the people,"" al-Abadi acknowledged it could be delayed. He was unable to describe how Iraqis live in areas controlled by ISIS, only saying it was ""very rough.""

""That's why we are very eager to liberate these areas as soon as possible,"" al-Abadi said.

But al-Abadi also wants an offensive to take place when Iraq’s military has received enough training and has access to supply routes and air cover.

“Our timetable is not only time-linked, it's factual-linked,” he said. “We have to achieve certain things on the ground before we can take back Mosul.”

Al-Abadi believes that taking Mosul from ISIS could deal a fatal blow to the terror group and its symbolic claims that it has established a caliphate.

“This is the center of their state,"" he said. ""We would have killed their own ambition to establish that state on the other countries, as well, in the region."""

ABC's ""How to Get Away With Murder"" dropped a shocking bombshell in Thursday’s two-hour season finale: One of the show's main characters was killed off.

During the episode, Rebecca Sutter was found murdered, and viewers learned that Frank, played by Charlie Weber, killed Lila by choking her to death before dumping her body.

In addition, Connor Walsh, another main character in the smash-hit series, learns that his on-again, off-again boyfriend, Oliver Hampton, is HIV positive.

Before the finale aired, “Nightline” sat down with Jack Falahee, who plays Connor, and Aja Naomi King, who stars as Michaela Pratt, both members of the “Keating 5.”

Falahee spoke about what it meant to have a major character like Connor portrayed as someone grappling with such a serious issue.

“This happens to people every day and I think that we’re just trying to explore interesting storylines that are rooted in reality and told honestly,” Falahee told “Nightline."" “I think that any opportunity to discuss it and open a dialogue about it is good. Information is power so for people to know how to get tested safely and effectively.”

The “Keating 5” are five, ridiculously attractive law students who, along with the powerful and ruthless defense attorney, Annalise Keating, played by Viola Davis, get caught up in the murder of her husband.

“Viola Davis is so amazing,” King, 30, said. “Not only is she just the kindest person, she is so open to sharing what she has been through and what her life has been like, which for me, like that is so valuable.

When I look at this dark-skinned woman who is playing this sexy powerful character on TV, for me, I’m just like, ‘Yes,’” King, who is African-American like Davis, added.

King said the explosive scripts are “super top secret,” and she is always shocked by the jaw-dropping twists that come from the mind of show creator Peter Nowalk.

In talking about one particular episode, “Don’t Be,” King said she was reading “the part where Michaela pushes Sam over the stairs. I screamed and I literally flung my body against the wall. I was just like, ‘No, It couldn’t have been me. I couldn’t be the one! And then I was like, ‘No, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, no. There is no trophy. I can’t be the killer, I’m not the killer.’ And so that really threw me off. I didn’t want to be the killer.”

With a show called “How to Get Away With Murder,” violence is expected, but there is also plenty of sexual impropriety. Connor became known for using sex to get what he wanted.

“The writers did a wonderful job over the course of the season showing how Connor continues to utilize sex as a tool, but then he feels a little slimy about it,” Falahee, 26, said. “He has a lot of regret and I think that he sort of falls for Oliver unexpectedly.”

A year ago, Falahee was a driver for a car service. Now he plays one of the main characters.

“[Connor] is multifaceted. He has some really positive attributes but then he also has a lot of flaws,” Falahee said. “I think that being a co-conspirator on a murder has forced him to make some very morally ambiguous decisions.”

Now with the show’s first season wrapped, King said she is anxious to find out what will come next if the show is renewed for a second season.

“I am so curious about so many things,” she said. “But I know for sure if the show continues next year I think the murder and intrigue won’t stop there.”"

The car was upside-down when it was discovered at around 12:30 p.m. Saturday in the Spanish Fork River, about 50 miles south of Salt Lake City, the Spanish Fork Public Safety Department said.

Emergency crews tipped the car on its side and found the baby in a car seat in the back, officials reported.

The baby's mother, Lynn Jennifer Groesbeck, 25, was found dead in the driver's seat, officials said.

""The baby was in a car seat in the backseat on the passenger side,"" Lt. Cory Slaymaker, Spanish Fork Police Departments said. ""The vehicle was on its top, so the car seat could have been out of the water. The car was on the embankment, so I don't know how much water was getting into the car.""

He said the water was so cold that the rescue crew members could only stay in for short periods of time.

The little girl, Lily, was taken to Primary Chidren's Hospital in Salt Lake City, where she was in stable but critical condition, police said. According to the family, Lily was breathing on her own Sunday evening.

It is believed the car was in the river for more than 13 hours, police said.

""Where the car was at you couldnt see it from the roadway,"" Slaymaker said.

A nearby resident reported hearing something around 10:30 p.m. Friday, but didn't see ""anything out of the ordinary,"" the public safety department said.

The woman may have hit a cement barrier on a bridge before driving into the river, officials said, but it is unknown why she left the road.

The West Hollywood Sherriff’s Department received a call this afternoon from a “media source saying they received an anonymous call that the dress was in a restroom in the second floor of the London Hotel” where the actress was staying, Lt. Michael White said. “Hotel staff searched and found the dress in a bag hidden behind a counter in the bathroom. We believe this is the dress stolen from the hotel.”

There are no suspects, he said, although officials are reviewing surveillance video. A few smaller pearls appear to have fallen off the dress, but it seems to be intact, White added.

“We will maintain custody of the dress until a rep from the company or the victim comes to claim it,” he said. “We have lots of interesting things that happen in West Hollywood, we gave it the same attention we give any other case. It’s just another day in West Hollywood.”

The bathroom, which is being renovated, is accessible by both staff and visitors.

The actress's Calvin Klein Collection gown, made of more than 6,000 pearls and valued at $150,000, was stolen from her room at the London Hotel in West Hollywood Wednesday while she was out.

""This is a terribly unfortunate situation, and we are working with law enforcement on their investigation,"" a hotel representative previously told ABC News.

Nyong'o, 31, won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar last year and presented at this year's awards, wearing the custom dress that was designed for her by Francisco Costa.

Nyong'o's publicist declined to comment, while a rep for Calvin Klein has not yet responded to requests for comment."

The Dec. 18 message included several images of a toy Christmas elf, according to The Indianapolis Star, which obtained the email.

The email was sent by social worker Robin Paul to her staff within the Seamless Transition Integrated Care Clinic at the Roudebush VA Medical Center.

In one photograph, the elf pleads for Xanax, which is prescribed to treat anxiety and panic. The caption reads: ""Self-medicating for mental health issues."" In another image, the elf hangs by a Christmas light with the message: ""Caught in the act of suicidal behavior (trying to hang himself from an electrical cord).""

The news comes at a time when suicide among military veterans claims an estimated 22 lives a day, according to the Department of Veterans Affairs.

Critics called today's news just another black mark on an agency mired in scandal. In May 2014, VA Secretary Eric Shinseki resigned amid accusations that the department had hid unacceptably long wait times for patient care. In February, his replacement apologized after falsely claiming that he'd served in Special Forces.

""All we want for the VA to do is to be able to fix what's broken, to hold employees accountable and help restore the faith of veterans in their VA health care system,"" said Joe Davis, director of public affairs for the Veterans of Foreign Wars. ""This one employee, this one supervisor, violated all three of those. ... It was [an] extremely poor attempt at humor.""

In a statement released by a facility spokeswoman, Paul , the social worker who sent the email, said: ""I would like to sincerely apologize for the email message and I take full responsibility for this poor judgment. ... I hold all Veterans and military personnel in the highest regard and am deeply remorseful for any hurt this may have caused.""

In an emailed statement, the hospital called Paul's email ""totally inappropriate.""

""The Indianapolis VA Medical is committed to treating our Veterans and the health conditions they face with the utmost respect and compassion,"" the hospital said. ""We apologize to our Veterans and take suicide and mental health treatment seriously, striving to provide the highest quality.""

The VA would not say whether Paul had been fired, only that the matter had been handled."

Tuesday will be his 67th birthday.

FBI Director James Comey announced the increase on the bureau’s website, saying it is “long past time for Bob to come home.”

Levinson's family said in a statement to ABC News, ""Every year on this date, we remind the world that Bob's case is still not resolved and that this husband, father than grandfather is still not home where he belongs.""

Levinson, who served more than two decades with the FBI before retiring, was kidnapped from Kish Island off Iran’s southern coast on March 9, 2007. For years the U.S. government said Levinson was working at the time as a private investigator, but in December 2013 Levinson’s family acknowledged he was, in fact, working as a kind of freelance “spy” for a rogue CIA operation.

“The CIA sent Bob Levinson to Iran to do an investigation on its behalf,” family attorney David McGee said then.

McGee told ABC News at the time the CIA and the FBI betrayed Levinson as it tried to hide the fact that he had a long-term relationship with the CIA, spying on Iran’s nuclear program and on the Lebanese terror group Hezbollah in the rogue operation.

“[R]ather than acknowledge what they had done and try and save Bob’s life, they denied him,” McGee said.

The day Levinson was outed as spy for the CIA, then-White House Press Secretary Jay Carney declined to discuss the case, beyond saying Levinson was “not a U.S. government employee” when he was kidnapped. The CIA declined to comment on “any purported affiliation,” and only said, “The U.S. government remains committed to bringing him home safely to his family.”

Officials at the CIA and the White House National Security Council declined to comment for this report.

Levinson was last seen in so-called ""proof of life"" images in early 2013. He was wearing an orange jumpsuit, draped in chains and holding various signs, one of which said, ""Help me.""

The Iranian government has denied holding Levinson, but American officials have repeatedly said they suspect that at the very least, Iranian government officials know where he is.

Levinson has been held in captivity longer than any other American, according to the FBI. In 2012 the FBI announced a $1 million reward for information on Levinson’s location.

""We urge the governments of Iran and the United States to work together to resolve this case and send Bob home, so he can live the rest of his life quietly, surrounded by the family that loves him,"" the family statement today said."

Surveillance video of Tsarnaev’s purchase, in which he appears casual during the shopping trip, was shown to the jury today following a string of harrowing testimonies from the bombing’s survivors, family members of those who were killed and law enforcement officials since the trial’s start last week.

Later the night of the bombing, Tsarnaev’s Twitter account read, “Ain’t no love in the heart of the city, stay safe people,” and then later, “There are people that know the truth but stay silent & there are people that speak the truth but we don’t hear them cuz they’re the minority,” according to FBI Special Agent Steve Kimball, who took the stand for the prosecution.

The prosecution said in opening remarks that after buying milk, Tsarnaev returned to an apartment in New Bedford belonging to college friends where he “hung out with his friends and partied.” The next night, check-in swipe data and surveillance video showed that Tsarnaev apparently went to the gym, prosecutors said today. That night he allegedly tweeted, “I’m a stress free kind of guy.”

Today prosecutors also introduced a second Twitter account allegedly belonging to Tsarnaev, in which he purportedly wrote a month before the bombing, “It’s our responsibility my brothers & sisters to ask Allah to ease the hardships of the oppressed and give us victory over kufr [unbelievers] #islam #dua.” In another tweet, he asks followers to listen to the sermons of Anwar al-Awlaki, who was a high profile American member of al Qaeda before he was killed in September 2011.

In other videos shown earlier today, an FBI analyst stitched together from various surveillance videos the movement of the brothers in the seconds before, during and after the explosions, at one point appearing to show exactly where and when Dzhokhar Tsarnaev allegedly dropped a backpack with a deadly payload inside in the middle of the crowd. The surveillance videos appeared to capture a phone call between the brothers, the explosions, and then the route each took to escape the scene.

Prior to the FBI analyst’s testimony, the jury heard from Jessica Kensky, a newlywed who, along with her new husband, was injured in the attack. Kensky said that immediately after the blast a man told her, “Ma’am, you’re on fire,” and then pushed her to the ground to extinguish the flames.

Kensky rolled to the witness stand in a wheelchair, having lost both legs as a result of the attack, though one was amputated just last month. Her husband, Patrick Downes, lost a leg as well.
Tsarnaev maintained his flat, seemingly disinterested demeanor as Kensky testified, just as he had for most of the hearings last week."

The video, which surfaced over the weekend, was posted to Twitter by Unheard, which describes itself as ""an alliance of black students organized for change within campus administration and atmosphere."" The video shows young men on a bus chanting, ""There will never be a n----r at SAE.""

The tweet, directed at OU president David Boren, said, ""Racism is alive at The University of Oklahoma.""

Boren said at a news conference Monday that he was ""sickened by the video,"" and, ""I couldn't sleep after that.""

And the Tri Delta sorority announced that it is investigating the incident. In the video, Tri Delta members are seen singing with SAE members on the charter bus.

""We are deeply disappointed by the conduct of the students involved in the incident at The University of Oklahoma,"" the national Tri Delta sorority said in a statement. ""Tri Delta expects its members to uphold the highest responsibilities of college women. The behavior documented in the video is deplorable and is in no way consistent with Tri Delta's ideals and core values. We are cooperating fully with our partners at the university as they investigate this matter.""

The sorority later issued a followup statement, saying, ""Members of the chapter were not pictured in the video and have not been and are not currently the subject of any investigation. We will continue to cooperate fully with our partners at the university.""

Boren said in an earlier written statement that all ties and affiliations between the school and the SAE chapter are ""hereby severed.""

""To those who have misused their free speech in such a reprehensible way, I have a message for you. You are disgraceful,"" Boren's statement read. ""You have violated all that we stand for. You should not have the privilege of calling yourselves 'Sooners.' Real Sooners are not racist. Real Sooners are not bigots. Real Sooners believe in equal opportunity. Real Sooners treat all people with respect. Real Sooners love each other and take care of each other like family members.

""All of us will redouble our efforts to create the strongest sense of family and community,"" Boren added. ""We vow that we will be an example to the entire country of how to deal with this issue. There must be zero tolerance for racism everywhere in our nation.""

Boren said SAE residents would have to remove their possessions and vacate the house ""by midnight tomorrow.""

At Monday’s news conference, Boren added that he doesn't plan on helping the displaced residents find housing.

""That's not our responsibility,"" he said. ""We don't provide student services to bigots.""

In fact, he said he'd be happy if the ""bus-load"" of students involved left school, adding that the university's legal team is exploring possible further punishment up to and including expulsion.

""As they pack their bags, I hope they think long and hard about what they've done,"" Boren said.

Boren called the video ""heartbreaking for every member of this community.""

The national SAE organization said in its own statement that it closed the Oklahoma Kappa chapter at the University of Oklahoma and suspended all of the fraternity's members -- and the members involved with the incident could have their membership privileges revoked permanently.

""We apologize for the unacceptable and racist behavior of the individuals in the video, and we are disgusted that any member would act in such a way,"" the online statement read. ""Furthermore, we are embarrassed by this video and offer our empathy not only to anyone outside the organization who is offended but also to our brothers who come from a wide range of backgrounds, cultures and ethnicities."""

Tony Robinson Jr., who was known to his family as Tyrell, was fatally shot by a police officer on Friday and the incident is now the subject of a state Department of Justice investigation.

Robinson's mother is white and his father is African American, and at a news conference this afternoon, Robinson's uncle, Turin Carter, spoke out on behalf of the family about how this is a universal issue that should be understood by people of all races.

""A lot of his identity was formed because of his racial ambiguity,"" Carter said.

""Tyrell felt a misfit for most of his life and that's why we became close,"" he said, while his sister -- Robinson’s mother -- stood behind him.

Robinson’s death comes after a growing list of cases where unarmed teens were killed at the hands of white men, and Carter said that though the parallels to the shooting deaths of Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown are inevitable, there are significant differences because of his nephew’s mixed race.

""I absolutely remember hashtagging Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown,"" Carter said of the outpouring on social media. ""It’s surreal to realize that now my nephew is now a hashtag.""

""We don’t want to just stop at black lives matter. ... Tyrell is a mixture of everything. You can’t look at him and say he's black,"" Carter said.

Carter thanked the droves of supporters who have been talking about the case on social media and attending rallies but urged all involved to make sure that they were not anti-law enforcement in their demonstrations.

""We appreciate the police and we understand the necessity for them but once again that does not excuse what happened,"" Carter said.

""It takes one bullet from a trained gunman to end a life -- it takes one bullet -- and we know how many were fired,"" Carter said. Police have not officially confirmed how many shots were fired.

Madison Police Chief Mike Koval told ABC News that he spoke to Robinson’s grandmother on the night of the shooting but has been giving the family space. When asked what he would say to the teen’s grieving parents, he told ABC News: ""I don’t have a good answer except to say I’m sorry.""

""I apologize for what has happened to their son, their grandson, their nephew, their friend, their family member, their sibling,"" Koval said. ""I apologize to the community that we're all coping with this under these circumstances."""

But there's more than their marriage proposal that'll bring tears to your eyes.

""My fiance proposed Jan. 25 in Vivian Park,"" Jensen of Provo, Utah, said. ""We went ice skating, we built a snowman, and he said, 'I have a short film I want to show you.’ At the end there was a clip of my sister saying, 'I believe Jimmy has a question for you right now,' and the video cut out. That's when I saw him [Jimmy] down on one knee.""

Jensen, 21, happily said yes and the two began planning their May 1 nuptials, unaware that a complete stranger would soon be playing a part.

""I went last Friday to go look at wedding dresses at a pop-up shop,"" she said. ""I actually ended up going alone and was trying to get opinions from other people in the store. I was really having a lot of fun and then I put on ‘the’ dress. Right when I put it on, I said, ‘OK, this is the one.’ It was perfect, so I went around to the front to pay for it.""

But before Jensen could even pull out her wallet, another bride-to-be had already picked up the tab, Carrie Ling, who's a co-owner of the shop Elizabeth Cooper Design, told ABC News.

""I think she planned this from the get-go,"" she said. ""She came in tried on a couple of gowns and I asked, 'You didn’t like anything today?' And she said, 'Actually, I'd like to pay for one of their gowns.'""

The woman noticed Jensen was alone, Ling said

""So, she pointed to Liz and said, 'I think I’ll pick her,'” she recalled. ""She wanted to be anonymous and that was all that went into it. We rang her up and she left.""

Ling informed Jensen of the exciting news: that a complete stranger had paid for her $465 wedding gown in full.

""In my mind I thought, 'That happens at the drive-thru at McDonald's, that doesn’t happen with a wedding dress,"" Jensen said, laughing. ""I was just so incredibly touched. To have that person who can look inside themselves to do something nice for someone else, it's something I'll never forget for sure.""

The young couple, who met their freshman year at Brigham Young University in Provo, plans to use this experience to personalize their wedding reception.

""We want to have our marriage built upon that principle of giving to other people,"" Jensen said. ""We want to have the news clip of our wedding dress story and a table set up where guests will pledge to be kind and do a service for someone else."""
1wVWUkh,2015-03-18 00:00:00,Tairod Nathan Webster Pugh: Former US Air Force Mechanic Charged With Trying to Join ISIS in Syria - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/International/us-air-force-mechanic-charged-join-isis-syria/story?id=29699712,"A former U.S. Air Force veteran has been arrested by the FBI for allegedly trying to join ISIS, the brutal terrorist group wreaking havoc in Syria and Iraq, after watching their online propaganda videos, authorities announced today.

Tairod Nathan Webster Pugh, 47, who is from New Jersey but had been living overseas for years, was secretly arrested two months ago after being deported back to the United States.

On Jan. 10, he flew from Egypt to Turkey hoping to slip into Syria and ""fight violent jihad"" with ISIS, but Turkish authorities refused to let him enter their country, federal prosecutors say in court documents filed in Brooklyn, N.Y., authorities said.

Egyptian authorities then deported Pugh to the United States, where he was arrested by the FBI and found to be carrying multiple electronic devices, including a cell phone that allegedly contained a photograph of a machine gun. Some of the data on the electronic devices had been deleted, prosecutors say.

On his laptop, FBI agents discovered that he had been viewing ISIS propaganda online and conducting online searches for such phrases as ""borders controlled by Islamic state,"" ""kobani border crossing,"" and ""who controls kobani,"" according to prosecutors.

In addition, the FBI recovered two of Pugh's backpacks, which allegedly contained two compasses, a solar-powered flashlight, a solar-powered power source, a fatigue jacket and camping clothes.

Pugh also allegedly searched online for the ISIS video ""Flames of War,"" a 55-minute piece of propaganda that even the FBI highlighted late last year when asking ""for the public's help identifying individuals who have traveled—or are planning to travel—overseas to engage in combat alongside terrorist organizations.""

A month before his alleged attempt to join ISIS, Pugh was fired from his job as an airplane mechanic in Kuwait, according to court documents. He learned how to install and maintain aircraft engines, navigation systems and weapons systems while serving in the Air Force from 1986 to 1990, the documents say.

According to court documents, he ""appears to have close ties to a woman in Egypt whom he has identified as his wife.""

A federal grand jury in Brooklyn, N.Y. indicted Pugh Monday on two charges -- attempting to provide material support to terror organization, and obstruction and attempted obstruction of an official proceeding.

Over the past 18 months, about 30 people have been charged with joining terrorist groups in Syria and Iraq or trying to do so.

Pugh converted to Islam after moving to San Antonio, Texas, in 1998 and ""became increasingly radical in his beliefs,"" the feds said.

In 2001, while he was working as a mechanic for American Airlines, a coworker notified the FBI that Pugh had been expressing anti-American sentiment and that he sympathized with Osama bin Laden, authorities said.

Pugh will be arraigned before a federal judge on Wednesday. If convicted at trial, Pugh faces a maximum sentence of 35 years in prison.

FBI Special Agent Steven Kimball will take the stand again this morning to be cross-examined about his testimony Monday, which centered around Tsarnaev’s purported obsession with violent jihadi views espoused on the secret Twitter account @Al_Firdausi, a profile with tweets that praise an American al Qaeda cleric, Anwar al Awlaki, and declared hope for “victory over kfur [nonbelievers].”

It’s through tweets like these that prosecutors hope to undercut the defense argument that “Jahar spent most of his time on the Internet doing things that teenagers do: Facebook, cars, girls,"" as his defense attorney Judy Clarke insisted in her opening statement last week. At the time of the bombings, Tsarnaev was 19 and his older brother Tamerlan was 26.

In a startling admission during opening statements last week, Clarke told jurors that her client was responsible of the crimes in contained in a federal indictment, saying, ""it was him,"" but insisted, “Tamerlan led the way down Boylston Street.""

“It was Tamerlan Tsarnaev who self-radicalized,” Clarke told the court. “It was Jahar who followed him.""

The government hinted that it would reveal Dzhokhar Tsarnaev’s own alleged obsession with extremism in its opening statements.

“The defendant looked and acted like he was a typical young adult,"" Assistant U.S. Attorney William Weinreb said. “But the evidence will show that he wasn’t. He had a side to him that he kept hidden, even from his closest friends.”

FBI Special Agent Kimball laid out part of that life Monday, the third day of Tsarnaev’s trial. Tsarnaev maintained two Twitter accounts using email accounts that were linked to him and looped back to the University of Massachusetts/Dartmouth, where he was a student, Kimball testified.

On one, @J_Tsar, Tsarnaev used to tweet “Ain't no love in the heart of the city, stay safe people,” at 5:04 p.m. April 15, 2013, roughly two hours after he detonated the pressure cooker bomb that prosecutors said killed college student Lingzi Lu and eight-year-old Martin Richard. A video shown in court yesterday captures the moment when that bomb exploded and Dzhokhar hustled away in the chaos, pushing people out of the way as he fled the scene.

A tweet that he sent from that account a year earlier – on April 16, 2012 – Kimball told the court, could be interpreted as a threat against marathon organizers. It reads, “They will spend their money and they will regret it and then they will be defeated.”

Anwar al-Awlaki, to whom Tsarnaev allegedly encouraged his few online followers to listen, was an American high-profile member of al Qaeda who was linked to a number of domestic terror plots. Al-Awlaki was killed in a drone strike in Yemen in 2011.

Under cross examination, the defense attempted to paint a majority of Tsarnaev’s purported tweets as harmless. Many times, they said, he was quoting hip hop songs. The one that prosecutors indicated was an ominous tweet about the 2012 marathon was actually a line from the Quran, the defense said.

The second, secret Twitter account was under the name Ghuraba, which loosely translates as the Muslim word for strangers, and showed a picture of the Chechen capital Grozny – which the defense said had been misidentified by Kimball as the Muslim holy city of Mecca."

The toddler, Owen Wright, was playing in a park in Sprague, Washington, on Sunday with his older brother, 10-year-old Brenden, and sister, 8-year-old Delicia. The siblings were playing unsupervised in a park next to their babysitter’s home while their father, Michael Wright, was at work, according to local ABC affiliate KXLY.

Surveillance footage from a nearby grocery store shows the suspect running off with Owen in his arms.

As the suspect fled with Owen, the toddler’s siblings began chasing after him.

""This little girl come running around the corner screaming her head off,” witness Dorothy Giddings told KXLY.

Delicia’s screams alerted passersby, including two teenage boys who joined the pursuit.

“I didn’t really care. There was a kid’s life in danger,” said one of the teens, Andrew Crane.

“I don’t consider myself a hero. I consider myself a person doing the right thing,” said another, Isaac Yow.

The suspect eventually abandoned Owen in an empty lot before continuing to flee.

“I told that little girl, I said, 'Honey, you did exactly what you needed to do scream your head off,’” Giddings said of Owen’s sister. “That's what saved that baby. Her screaming and us running.”

The suspect in the alleged kidnapping remains at large. Police in the small community of Sprague, population 500, are asking anyone who recognizes the suspect to contact the Lincoln County Sheriff's Office at 509-725-3501.

The siblings’ father, Michael Wright, says he “can’t explain” what happened after hearing his son had been kidnapped.

“I can't explain the feeling, the anxiety and everything that goes into finding out your children is missing or something has happened to them,"" Wright told KXLY."

The jury awarded the late Gaye's family approximately $7.4 million in damages. Williams will pay about $1.6 million and Thicke will pay about $1.77 million.

The jury ruled Clifford Harris, the rapper known as T.I. who performed on ""Blurred Lines"" and received a co-songwriting credit, did not infringe on the Gaye copyright.

Gaye's daughter, Nona Gaye, wept in court as the verdict was read.

""Right now, I feel free,"" Nona Gaye said after the verdict, according to The Associated Press, ""free from ... Pharrell Williams and Robin Thicke's chains and what they tried to keep on us and the lies that were told.""

Howard King, an attorney representing Williams, Thicke and Harris, told reporters he didn't even discuss possible damages in his closing arguments because he didn't think the jury would impose them. For the same reason, he said, his clients declined to settle out of court.

""My clients know in their heart that they wrote that song independently and were not going to be held up,"" King said.

He added that he believed the decision by the jury of five women and three men could affect the music the public gets to hear because it may make record labels hesitant to release work strongly inspired by a particular genre, song or artist.

Thicke, Williams and Harris, via a joint statement from Thicke's representative, said, ""While we respect the judicial process, we are extremely disappointed in the ruling made today, which sets a horrible precedent for music and creativity going forward. ... We are reviewing the decision, considering our options and you will hear more from us soon about this matter.""

The lawyer for the Gaye family, Richard Busch, said the case was not about songwriting inspiration, it was about copying.

""Throughout this case, they made comments about how this was about a groove and how this was about an era and how this was about a genre,"" Busch said. ""It wasn't. It was about the copying of 'Got to Give it Up.'""

The dispute began in 2013, when Thicke, Williams and Harris filed a lawsuit against the Gaye family to defend themselves against a public accusation that they stole parts of ""Got to Give It Up."" Later that year, the Gaye family counter-sued. Then, in 2014, a judge sided with Gaye's loved ones, ruling that their musicological experts provided sufficient evidence for the case to go to trial.

During the trial, which began late last month, Thicke admitted on the stand that ""Got to Give It Up"" was one of his favorite songs. King said Williams also idolizes the work of Gaye, who died in 1984.

In addition to listening to testimony, the jury was expected to listen to the snippets of ""Got to Give It Up,"" performed from copyrighted sheet music, to decide whether Thicke, Williams and Harris were guilty of copyright infringement.

Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that all three songwriters credited on the song “Blurred Lines” were found to have infringed on a Marvin Gaye copyright. In fact, a jury found Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams infringed on the copyright, but that Clifford Harris, professionally known as T.I., did not."

In a special ABC News ""Hidden America"" report on the school that first aired in May 2013, Diane Sawyer and ABC News producers followed the daily lives of the school's students and faculty, including its then-new principal, during the 2012-2013 school year. ABC News then went back in September 2013 to follow Strawberry Mansion at the start of the new 2013-2014 school year for a second special that aired in December 2013.

Grammy award-winning hip-hop artist Drake was so moved by the ABC News specials, especially after learning that budget cuts had left the school without a music teacher, that he donated $75,000 to Strawberry Mansion for a new recording studio.

But even though members of Drake’s crew finished the studio last summer, Principal Linda Cliatt-Wayman told ABC News that budget issues and the school's violent history made it hard to find a music instructor.

So the studio, which included new keyboards and other equipment, as well as sound booths, sat unused for months.

Finally, Ben Diamond arrived in February to take on the role as a part-time music teacher who would teach studio production, but even then, Wayman said student interest was low at first.

It wasn’t until she used the school’s PA system to broadcast the first student-produced song to come out of the new recording studio that Wayman said students became interested. Now 91 students have signed up for the studio production class, she said.

""Music has a way of bringing people together,"" Wayman told ABC News via email. ""That is what I want the music to do for my kids, bring them all together to find the special gifts that lay dormant inside of them. I want them to get distracted on their positive attributes to help them create within and around them. They all love music. That is the one thing they all have in common.

""For me, the opening of the studio is more than about music,"" Wayman added. ""It is about making and keeping a promise to students who are constantly disappointed, pleasing them, making them happy and getting them to see that they must finish what they start [and] work hard to bring dreams into reality.""

In addition to Drake, other ABC News viewers donated money to Strawberry Mansion after the 2013 specials aired. Their generosity helped provide school uniforms, jackets for the school's first football team, warm-up suits for the basketball team, school trips, PSAT and ACT prep classes, as well as scholarships for seniors heading off to college. Viewer donations also helped provide basic necessities that were missing at Strawberry Mansion, including books, notebooks and calculators."

Officers Tyler Beddoes, Jared Warner and Bryan Dewitt, who responded to the incident in the Spanish Fork River Saturday, say they heard an adult voice say, ""Help me,"" Spanish Fork Police officer Lt. Matt Johnson told ABC News.

Johnson said the two firefighters, Paul Tomadakis and Lee Mecham, also heard the voice before realizing there was a toddler in the car.

""To me, it was plain as day,"" Warner told KSL.com. ""I remember hearing a voice that didn't sound like a child, just saying, 'Help me.'""

The police officers and firemen declined to comment to ABC News.

""There were some individuals on top of the bridge, but all three stated [the voice] came from the vehicle,"" Johnson said. ""It prompted us to lift the car between the three officers and firemen. They physically lifted the car from the side, and they located the infant in the car seat at that time.""

Johnson said the police don't believe the voice came from Groesbeck.

""Due to the trauma she sustained, we suspect she was deceased upon impact. I don’t believe she survived the impact of the car crash. There was massive trauma,"" Johnson said.

""The baby was in a car seat in the backseat on the passenger side,"" Lt. Cory Slaymaker of the Spanish Fork Police Department had said. ""The vehicle was on its top, so the car seat could have been out of the water. The car was on the embankment, so I don't know how much water was getting into the car.""

He said the water was so cold that the rescue crew members could only stay in for short periods of time.

FBI Special Agent Steven Kimball will take the stand again this morning to be cross-examined about his testimony Monday, which centered around Tsarnaev’s purported obsession with violent jihadi views espoused on the secret Twitter account @Al_Firdausi, a profile with tweets that praise an American al Qaeda cleric, Anwar al Awlaki, and declared hope for “victory over kfur [nonbelievers].”

It’s through tweets like these that prosecutors hope to undercut the defense argument that “Jahar spent most of his time on the Internet doing things that teenagers do: Facebook, cars, girls,"" as his defense attorney Judy Clarke insisted in her opening statement last week. At the time of the bombings, Tsarnaev was 19 and his older brother Tamerlan was 26.

In a startling admission during opening statements last week, Clarke told jurors that her client was responsible of the crimes in contained in a federal indictment, saying, ""it was him,"" but insisted, “Tamerlan led the way down Boylston Street.""

“It was Tamerlan Tsarnaev who self-radicalized,” Clarke told the court. “It was Jahar who followed him.""

The government hinted that it would reveal Dzhokhar Tsarnaev’s own alleged obsession with extremism in its opening statements.

“The defendant looked and acted like he was a typical young adult,"" Assistant U.S. Attorney William Weinreb said. “But the evidence will show that he wasn’t. He had a side to him that he kept hidden, even from his closest friends.”

FBI Special Agent Kimball laid out part of that life Monday, the third day of Tsarnaev’s trial. Tsarnaev maintained two Twitter accounts using email accounts that were linked to him and looped back to the University of Massachusetts/Dartmouth, where he was a student, Kimball testified.

On one, @J_Tsar, Tsarnaev used to tweet “Ain't no love in the heart of the city, stay safe people,” at 5:04 p.m. April 15, 2013, roughly two hours after he detonated the pressure cooker bomb that prosecutors said killed college student Lingzi Lu and eight-year-old Martin Richard. A video shown in court yesterday captures the moment when that bomb exploded and Dzhokhar hustled away in the chaos, pushing people out of the way as he fled the scene.

A tweet that he sent from that account a year earlier – on April 16, 2012 – Kimball told the court, could be interpreted as a threat against marathon organizers. It reads, “They will spend their money and they will regret it and then they will be defeated.”

Anwar al-Awlaki, to whom Tsarnaev allegedly encouraged his few online followers to listen, was an American high-profile member of al Qaeda who was linked to a number of domestic terror plots. Al-Awlaki was killed in a drone strike in Yemen in 2011.

Under cross examination, the defense attempted to paint a majority of Tsarnaev’s purported tweets as harmless. Many times, they said, he was quoting hip hop songs. The one that prosecutors indicated was an ominous tweet about the 2012 marathon was actually a line from the Quran, the defense said.

The second, secret Twitter account was under the name Ghuraba, which loosely translates as the Muslim word for strangers, and showed a picture of the Chechen capital Grozny – which the defense said had been misidentified by Kimball as the Muslim holy city of Mecca."
1wWz1cq,2015-03-10 00:00:00,Hillary Clinton Emails: Former Secretary of State Addresses Situation - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/hillary-clinton-addresses-private-email-situation/story?id=29529931,"Addressing the ongoing email controversy for the first time, Hillary Clinton said today that she used a private account out of ""convenience"" and later went through a ""thorough process"" to deliver her work-related messages to the State Department.

""I opted for convenience ... because I thought it would be easier to carry one device,"" she told reporters at the United Nations in New York.

She said that she ""chose not to keep"" personal, private emails that had to do with planning her daughter Chelsea Clinton's wedding, her mother's funeral and yoga routines.

Clinton also talked about the private server that was used to host her email domain, saying that the system was set up for her husband and his post-presidential office that ""proved to be effective and secure.""

She also confirmed earlier reports that the server was based out of the former first couple's home in Chappaqua, New York.

""There were no security breaches,"" she added.

Clinton maintained that she ""fully complied with every rule I was governed by."" She did not directly address a 2005 update in the Foreign Affairs Manual codified by the State Department which ruled that employees could only use private email accounts for official business if they turned those emails over to be entered into government computers. That ruling also forbade State Department employees from including ""sensitive but unclassified"" information on private email, except for some very narrow exceptions. She did, however, note that she never sent classified information via email.

Today's press conference came after the State Department confirmed earlier today that they will be publishing the 55,000 emails that Clinton handed over to them after they are reviewed. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the documents will be available online on a government website.

She said that the release will follow Freedom of Information Act guidelines, meaning that any redacted content will have an explanation about why it was removed.

Prior to today, Clinton's only comment to date about the email scandal came via Twitter when she noted that she has asked the State Department to release her email, though that process is expected to take months.

It was publicly reported last week that Clinton, who is widely seen as the likely Democratic presidential nominee, used a private server and email domain during her tenure as Secretary of State rather than using the government's email system.

1wXIKbP,2015-02-02 00:00:00,Chris Christie Says Parents Should Have a 'Measure of Choice' on Vaccinating Kids - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/vaccination-gov-chris-christie-calls-balance-measure-choice/story?id=28665289,"New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie broke with President Obama on Monday, saying there must be a ""balance"" from the government between parental choice and views on vaccines and public health interests, stressing families must have a ""measure of choice"" on the issue.

""Mary Pat and I have had our children vaccinated and we think that it’s an important part of being sure we protect their health and the public health,"" Christie said, according to the Washington Post, traveling with Christie, who is currently on a trip to the United Kingdom. ""I also understand that parents need to have some measure of choice in things as well, so that’s the balance that the government has to decide.""

""There has to be a balance and it depends on what the vaccine is, what the disease type is, and all the rest,"" Christie added. ""Not every vaccine is created equal and not every disease type is as great a public health threat as others.""

This is a clear break from the president, who in an interview with NBC on Sunday said clearly: ""You should get your kids vaccinated.""

Noting that ""measles is preventable,"" Obama said, ""I understand that there are families that, in some cases, are concerned about the effect of vaccinations.""

""The science is, you know, pretty indisputable,"" the president told NBC's Savannah Guthrie. ""We've looked at this again and again. There is every reason to get vaccinated, but there aren’t reasons to not.""

Christie's office issued a statement to clarify the comments, saying, ""The Governor believes vaccines are an important public health protection and with a disease like measles there is no question kids should be vaccinated.""

""At the same time different states require different degrees of vaccination, which is why he was calling for balance in which ones government should mandate,"" the statement reads.

Christie wasn't the only possible 2016 candidate to weigh in on the vaccine debate raging across the country. In a radio interview with Laura Ingraham today, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said that while he thinks there should be rules for some vaccines, most vaccinations “ought to be voluntary.”

“I’m not anti-vaccine at all, but particularly, most of them ought to be voluntary,” Paul said. “What happens if you have somebody not wanting to take the small pox vaccine and it ruins it for everybody else? I think there are times in which there can be some rules but for the most part, it ought to be voluntary.”

He also revealed he delayed some of his children’s vaccines when they were born.

“I was annoyed when my kids were born that they wanted them to take hepatitis B in the neo natal nursery and it’s like that’s a sexually transmitted disease or blood borne disease,” Paul said. “I didn’t like them getting 10 vaccines at once, so I actually delayed my kids vaccines and had them staggered over time.”

Christie and Paul were asked about the issue amid a measles outbreak linked to Disneyland in California and that has now spread to 14 other states. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is urging all unvaccinated people to get vaccinated and to make sure to vaccinate their children on schedule.

This isn't Christie's first controversial comments on a public health issue. Last October, he broke with the White House and federal guidelines when he quarantined a nurse returning from West Africa where she had treated Ebola patients. The nurse did not show any symptoms of the disease and the quarantine caused an outcry on both sides of the issue.

White House senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer said in an exchange with a reporter on Twitter that he hopes Christie will ""clarify"" his comments on the vaccination issue because ""it's important that responsible leaders speak with one voice."" Pfeiffer added that he didn't know what Christie will do, but ""not clarifying will say a lot about how he plans to run his race.""

@MarkHalperin I hope he will clarify, bc it's important that responsible leaders speak with one voice, but don't know what he will do

Pfeiffer is referring to Christie's potential 2016 presidential campaign. His three-day trip to Great Britain is an effort to promote trade with the U.K. and New Jersey businesses, but is also an effort to give the governor some foreign policy credentials ahead of a likely run for the White House. He recently visited both Canada and Mexico as well.

Later today, he is scheduled to visit with Prime Minister David Cameron at 10 Downing Street before attending a dinner with members of Cameron's cabinet.

The helicopter was reported missing at 8:30 p.m. Tuesday and debris was located at about 2 a.m., base officials said in a statement.

Mike Spaits, Eglin Air Force Base public affairs officer, told ABC News that “some human remains have been found.”

There are no further details released at this time. Officials will be holding a news conference later today.

""There was fog. I do not know at this time if it was a contributing factor, but when our search-and-rescue personnel arrived on scene there was very limited visibility,"" Eglin Air Force Base spokesman Andy Bourland had said earlier in the day.

Bourland said the helicopter did not issue a distress call. Some debris has been located east of the Navarre Bridge and it is expected that debris will continue to appear in the area moving toward the bridge.

The Marines are part of a special operations group based at Camp Lejeune in Jacksonville, North Carolina, and the soldiers were from a Hammond, Louisiana-based National Guard unit, officials said.

The crew of a second helicopter was recovered and is safe, Bourland said.

The accident, which happened during a training mission on a beach between Pensacola and Destin, is under investigation.

1wXsaiR,2015-03-18 00:00:00,Robert Durst Moved to Jail Equipped to Deal With Mentally Ill - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/US/robert-durst-moved-jail-equipped-deal-mentally-ill/story?id=29692743,"Robert Durst was being transferred this evening a jail equipped to deal with the mentally ill, as he awaits extradition to Los Angeles to face a first degree murder charge, police said.

Durst, who appeared before a judge again today in New Orleans to face additional charges stemming from his arrest on Sunday, was being moved to the Elayn Hunt Correctional Center, which is about an hour away from New Orleans, an Orleans Parish Sheriff's spokesman said.

The move comes after the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeal ruled that the district court was wrong to order Durst held at the Orleans Parish prison and that he should have been moved to the Acute Mental Health Facility at Elayn Hunt Correctional Center, as the sheriff had requested.

""It is within the sole discretion of the Sheriff to determine where to house inmates in need of mental health treatment,"" the court said in its ruling.

As Durst was being moved this evening, police in Houston were conducting a search of his condo in the the Rice Village neighborhood.

The real estate scion was arrested in the Marriott Hotel in New Orleans due to a warrant for the 2000 murder of his friend Susan Berman in Los Angeles, but when police arrived at his room, he was found with a .38 caliber revolver and marijuana, police said.

During his court appearance this morning, the 71-year-old appeared dazed, not immediately responding when his name was called. He was shackled when he walked towards the judge. Durst was kept isolated from other inmates and stood behind a plexiglass booth but approached a podium when addressing the court.

In court today Durst's legal team said he suffers only from mild Aspergers, but prosecution sources told ABC News they believe he suffers from undisclosed conditions that are ""much more severe.""

Durst's attorney argued that the original arrest was based ""on a TV show"" even though the LAPD has disputed that argument.

""Bob Durst didn't kill Susan Berman and he doesn't know who did,"" Durst's attorney Dick DeGuerin said outside of court today. ""That being said my concern that the warrant that was issued in California was issued because of a television show and not because of facts.

""We want to contest the basis for his arrest because I think it's not based on facts, it's based on ratings. So we will continue to fight for Bob. We want to get to California as quickly as we can so that we can get to a court of law and try the case where it needs to be tried,"" DeGuerin said.

Durst will be detained in New Orleans through Monday.

This is his second court appearance in as many days, and on Monday he agreed to be extradited to California to face the murder charge, but Orleans Parish District Attorney Leon Cannizarro later decided to charge him with weapon and drug possession.

Louisiana State Trooper Melissa Matey confirmed to ABC News on Monday that an arrest warrant was issued for Durst and he was rebooked in the Orleans Parish Jail under the charges of convicted felon in possession of a firearm and possession of a weapon with a controlled dangerous substance.

Durst, whose wife went missing in 1982 and friend Berman was found dead in her apartment on Christmas Eve in 2000, has already admitted to killing one person, his neighbor Morris Black, but was acquitted by a jury because he testified that he had done so in self-defense.

""Let me just say that we came here to waive jurisdiction and to go back to California and to get it on,"" Durst's lawyer Dick DeGuerin, who represented him in the 2003 case relating to Black's death.

""Bob Durst didn't kill Susan Berman -- he's ready to end all the rumor and speculation and have a trial but we're frustrated because the local authorities are considering filing charges on him here and holding him here,"" DeGuerin said in front of court.

Brody and Susan Pettit, the parents of Levi Pettit, released a statement Tuesday saying they were ""shocked and saddened"" by what they saw in the video.

""As parents of Levi, we love him and care for him deeply,"" they said. ""He made a horrible mistake, and will live with the consequences forever. However, we also know the depth of our son's character. He is a good boy, but what we saw in those videos is disgusting.

""While it may be difficult for those who only know Levi from the video to understand, we know his heart, and he is not a racist,"" they said. ""We raised him to be loving and inclusive and we all remain surrounded by a diverse, close-knit group of friends.""

Levi Pettit is the second of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon members seen in the video to be identified.

The president of Jesuit College Preparatory School of Dallas said the fraternity member apparently ""leading"" the racist chant on a bus full of students is a recent graduate of the high school.

""In the recent video regarding OU and the SAE [Sigma Alpha Epsilon] fraternity, it appears that a graduate from Jesuit Dallas is leading the racist chant,"" according to a statement by Mike Earsing, the president of Jesuit Dallas, which has confirmed its former student's name as Parker Rice, 19.

""I am appalled by the actions in the video and extremely hurt by the pain this has caused our community. It is unconscionable and very sad that in 2015 we still live in a society where this type of bigotry and racism takes place.""

Earsing added, ""Unfortunately, isolated incidents throughout our society remind us that there is still much work to be done.""

ABC News has been unable to reach Rice. The Jesuit Dallas Alumni Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

University of Oklahoma student Matthew Lopez, who lived on the same residence hall floor as Rice in Norman, Oklahoma, said ""he's a person of high moral fiber,"" and, ""someone that's tolerant of other people and their different cultures and their different backgrounds.

""I know Parker,"" Lopez told ABC News. ""He's not a racist.""

The University of Oklahoma, citing privacy laws, declined to name two students it expelled in connection to the now-viral video. So it was unclear whether Rice or Pettit were among the two expelled students.

University of Oklahoma President David Boren said the students who played a leadership role in the ""exclusionary"" chant had created a hostile learning environment. He said the chant was heard not only by those on a bus, but also affected the entire university community because it was distributed through social media.

Boren said, ""I have emphasized that there is zero tolerance for this kind of threatening racist behavior at the University of Oklahoma. I hope that the entire nation will join us in having zero tolerance of such racism when it raises its ugly head in other situations across our country.""

He continued, ""I am extremely proud of the reaction and response expressed by our entire university family -- students, faculty, staff, and alumni about this incident. They are 'Real Sooners' who believe in mutual respect for all. I hope that students involved in this incident will learn from this experience and realize that it is wrong to use words to hurt, threaten and exclude other people. We will continue our investigation of all the students engaged in the singing of this chant. Once their identities have been confirmed, they will be subject to appropriate disciplinary action.""

According to Boren's letter, if the expelled students disagree with the decision, they can contact the school's Equal Opportunity Office by this Friday.

The president of the university's Black Student Association, Isaac Hill, a 20-year-old engineering major, said he agreed with the president's decision to expel two of the students involved because ""those people don't deserve to carry the title that comes with being a student here."""
1wXvtqD,2015-03-11 00:00:00,Hillary Clinton's Emails: Unanswered Questions About Deleted Correspondence - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/hillary-clintons-emails-unanswered-questions-deleted-correspondence/story?id=29538638,"Hillary Clinton was likely hoping to put the issue of her use of a private email account to rest by hosting a news conference, but more than a few questions remain unanswered.

The former Secretary of State, who addressed the media shortly after giving a speech at the United Nations about women's empowerment, did not use a government email account during her tenure as the U.S.'s top diplomat.

She said today that the reason for the use of one, personal account was convenience, though that does not explain the issue fully.

Here are some of the questions that remain unanswered following Clinton's news conference.

Clinton argued that she had a number of emails about personal issues that should not be considered part of the public domain.

""No one wants their personal emails made public, and I think most people understand that and respect that privacy,"" Clinton said today.

Clinton’s word is really the only check that the public will have on this front. The emails that she chose not to keep included emails ""about planning Chelsea's wedding or my mother's funeral arrangements, condolence notes to friends, as well as yoga routines, family vacations, the other things you typically find in inboxes,"" she said.

Yes, but only the emails that Clinton and her team have deemed related to her work as Secretary of State, and then from there, only what the State Department approved. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said that once cleared, the 55,000 pages of emails that Clinton handed over will be shared publicly on a government website though not for several months.

When it comes to her personal emails, the public will never know. Today, Clinton ruled out an independent review of her server.

Clinton amassed 62,320 emails between March 2009 and February 2013 and fewer than half of those had to do with work.

After today's news conference, Clinton's team released a statement clarifying the exact number of work and personal emails, saying that 30,490 were handed over to the State Department because they related to work and 31,830 were deemed ""private, personal records.""

Her camp clarified that the timeframe for these emails does not exactly match up to her tenure as Secretary of State -- she was sworn in on Jan. 21, 2009 -- but for roughly the first two months she used the email address she had left over from her time as senator. However, her ""practice"" of emailing individuals who used a government account in order to ensure that they were saved is the only record that exists for that time period. Once she transitioned from that Senate account she no longer had access.

That would mean that she sent 21.5 work emails and 22.46 personal emails per day.

There was no official answer to this. Clinton said that she chose to use one email address out of ""convenience.""

""Looking back, it would have been better if I'd simply used a second email account and carried a second phone, but at the time, this didn't seem like an issue,"" she said.

Clinton claims that she always knew that her emails to government employees, who used state.gov email addresses, ""were captured and preserved immediately on the system at the State Department.""

Clinton maintained that she ""fully complied with every rule I was governed by."" She did not directly address a 2005 update in the Foreign Affairs Manual codified by the State Department that ruled employees could only use private email accounts for official business if they turned those emails over to be entered into government computers. That ruling also forbade State Department employees from including ""sensitive but unclassified"" information on private email, except for some very narrow exceptions. She did, however, note that she never sent classified information via email.

She said that the personal server set up at her house in Chappaqua, New York, was already in place for her husband and his post-presidential career. That said, The Wall Street Journal reported that Bill Clinton has only sent two emails in his entire life, so his use of the system does not necessarily mean that the system is inherently secure.

When asked whether or not her email plan was acceptable by the White House's standards, Clinton said ""there are different rules governing the White House than there are governing the rest of the executive branch.""

""It had numerous safeguards,"" Clinton said of the server stored at her house. ""It was on property, guarded by the Secret Service, and there were no security breaches. So, I think that the use of that server, which started with my husband, certainly proved to be effective and secure.""

During today’s news conference, Clinton touted the ""convenience"" of using one device, but it seems her habits have changed.

Just two weeks ago, during a talk in Silicon Valley, Clinton said that she had both an iPhone and a BlackBerry, though she did not say when exactly she began using both devices.

She did not answer when asked if this issue has impacted her thinking about her expected presidential run, but Republicans are jumping into the controversy.

Rep. Trent Gowdy, who heads the House committee investigating the attack on the American consulate in Benghazi, Libya, said that ""there is no way to accept"" Clinton's explanation and is calling for an independent third party to review her server.

1wXWBpb,2015-03-11 00:00:00,Google CFO Patrick Pichette's Goodbye Note Will Make You Dream of Quitting Your Job - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/google-cfo-patrick-pichettes-goodbye-note-make-dream/story?id=29551533,"Google's chief financial officer Patrick Pichette knows how to quit in style.

After nearly seven years of overseeing the search giant's finances, Pichette, 52, is calling it quits to travel the world with his wife and enjoy what he called a ""perfectly fine mid life crisis full of bliss and beauty.""

While most people may dream of the day they can retire, Pichette can certainly afford it. He raked in nearly $31 million from his Google stock incentives from 2010 to 2013, according to the Associated Press. That payday is in addition to his executive salary and any bonuses he received.

In a Google+ post, Pichette said he began to think about an early retirement when he and his wife Tamar were watching the sunrise from the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro. Pichette recalled his wife asking him when would it be time for them to keep going and explore the world.

Not yet, he told her. With their 25th anniversary approaching this summer, Pichette said Tamar's question stuck with him.

With two children in college and one working at a start-up in Africa, he decided it was the perfect time to seize the moment and get to work on their next chapter -- traveling together to places they've always wanted to see, including Antarctica and Mount Everest.

""Working at Google is a privilege, nothing less,"" he wrote. ""I have worked with the best of the best, and know that I am leaving Google in great hands.""

The search is on for Pichette's replacement and he said he'd remain at the company to help with the transition process.

Vanessa Hicks said she had no idea her photo would be considered controversial. The photo, from a military family’s newborn photo shoot, showed a newborn infant wrapped in an American flag held by his father, who was in his military uniform.

Hicks, a Navy veteran herself and the wife of an active-duty Navy member, said her intention was to honor the flag as well as her clients, who wanted to incorporate their military service in the photo shoot.

“This is what he was fighting for, his son wrapped in an American flag,” Hicks told ABC News. However, when she posted the image on her page, she started to get comments accusing her of desecrating the flag.

On one Facebook page an unidentified poster put up her picture writing and wrote they found it was “disrespectful, rude, tacky, disgusting, and against the U.S. Flag Code.”

The Federal Flag Code has guidelines for the proper treatment of the U.S. Flag but there are no rules for punishment related to violations. In the past, the Supreme Court has found that people are protected from punishment under the First Amendment for manipulating or even burning the flag.

Hicks said she was surprised when messages suddenly started to pop up on her Facebook page and even her own website criticizing her photos.

She said she stayed up until 4 a.m. recently to take down comments from her business and company page, even on shoots that had nothing to do with the flag.

“I know how low I felt during those first few hours,” said Hicks. “[I felt] am I not a good American or veteran or wife. It’s a train-wreck you can’t help but watch.”

As Hicks tried to stop the comments from taking over her pages, others started to take notice and her picture went viral on social media sites. After that, Hicks found that many people, both military and civilian, told her they did not find the picture offensive.

“I have seen first-hand what is desecration of the flag,” Hicks said of her time in the military. “At the end of the day I didn’t do anything that disrespected this flag.”

Hicks, whose husband is still on active duty in the Navy, said the flag is a symbol of U.S. freedoms including the First Amendment right to free speech.

“[My husband] wouldn’t die for a flag, he would die for the freedoms that this country offers,” she told ABC News.

After her story grabbed local headlines, Hicks has been inundated by requests for photos shoots, and she said she plans to give 15 percent of all profits related to these shoots to the USO."

Jackson's resignation, which was announced this afternoon by city spokesman Jeff Small, makes him the sixth person who has been fired or forced to resign since the report was released March 4 detailing what it described as rampant racial bias in policing in the St. Louis suburb.

The letter announcing Jackson's resignation described it as ""a mutual decision by both the Police Chief and the City's administration.""

Lt. Col. Al Eickhoff will take over as the acting Chief of Police starting Thursday as the city launches a national search for a new chief of police, the letter stated.

Ferguson Mayor James Knowles said tonight that Jackson's one-year severance will be on par with his salary, which is roughly $100,000.

""The chief is the kind of honorable man that you don't have to go to, he comes to you when he knows this is something we have to seriously discuss,"" Knowles said.

Knowles added that the decision came ""after a lot of soul searching"" but that Jackson ""felt this was the best thing to move forward.""

Jackson had initially came under fire in August for his department's handling of the shooting death of unarmed teenager Michael Brown. In November, Jackson told ABC News that he had no plans to resign.

""I do not intend to resign or step down,"" he said at the time. ""I'm going to see this through.""

Knowles said that Eickoff joined the Ferguson police force in early August before Brown's shooting.

The U.S. astronaut was back on Earth after spending nearly six months aboard the International Space Station. Wilmore, along with Russians Alexander Samokutyaev and Elena Serova, returned to earth on the Soyuz spacecraft Thursday, completing a 249-mile free-fall.

Serova was the last of the astronauts removed, smiling broadly as she sat in the chair bundled up against temperatures a few degrees below freezing.

The return to Earth took about 45 minutes. The atmosphere helped slow down the Soyuz until parachutes opened and the spacecraft glided to a landing.

The astronauts were then taken to recliner-style chairs set up near the capsule to begin their readjustment to gravity and undergo brief medical tests. All three appeared in good condition.

Three other astronauts remain aboard the space station. They will be joined by three others on March 27; two of those -- Scott Kelly and Mikhail Kornienko -- are to spend a full year on the ISS.

The plan, which was created by Danish architect Bjarke Ingels at BIG and Thomas Heatherwick at Heatherwick Studio in London, includes glass canopies to allow light and air into the buildings.

The plans for developing the North Bayshore area were submitted today to the Mountain View city council for consideration and were posted online, alongside a nearly ten-minute video detailing the project.

Only a futuristic multi-billion dollar company like Google would consider being able to physically move a building -- but it's one of the cornerstones of the project.

Under the glass canopies, lightweight block-like structures that comprise rooms can be re-arranged like pieces of furniture, allowing Google to seamlessly adjust to its staffing needs.

While the buildings will increase Google's office square footage, the plan is to also open the campus up to the community to create a lively neighborhood feel with retail, restaurants and bicycle paths.

""We're really making sure that we make spaces very open and accessible so it's just not for Googlers, but it's for anyone who lives in the area to come by,"" David Radcliffe of Google said in the video.

Mountain View City Councilman Lenny Siegel told ABC News he is concerned about the traffic flow in Mountain View and the housing supply -- two factors he will have to consider as he evaluates Google's plan.

""Having wonderful new buildings with lots of well-paid employees sounds great, but it effects our housing supply and transportation,"" he said.

It will likely take more than one year for the proposal to be evaluated and approved and it was unclear how long it would take to make Google's dream office space a reality.

One thing is for certain, though: Google has come a long way since it started in a garage."

The incident, which was first reported by the Washington Post, is being investigated by the Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General.

The White House said today that President Obama is aware of the allegations and supports Secret Service Director Joe Clancy’s decision to turn the investigation over to the DHS Inspector General for a thorough review.

“We are aware of the alleged incident,” an Obama administration official told ABC News. “At the request of the Secret Service Director, Joe Clancy, the Department of Homeland Security’s Office of the Inspector General is conducting an investigation into the allegations. We’re not going to comment further while that investigation is ongoing.”

Both agents have been reassigned to non-operational assignments pending the outcome of the investigation.

The Secret Service has been under fire in recent years over a string of incidents including a White House incursion by a fence jumper who made it into the East Room as well as eight agents being dismissed after reports that they allegedly solicited prostitutes during an official trip to Colombia.

More than 100 demonstrators gathered, along with media and police presence, but the tone was much different than a night before, when a large crowd gathered following the resignation of the St. Louis suburb's police chief. It was during that gathering that shots rang out and the two officers were injured.

The officers were released from the hospital Thursday morning after sustaining non-threatening injuries, the St. Louis County Police said in a Facebook post. St. Louis County Police and the Missouri State Highway Patrol have taken over security for the protests in Ferguson since the shooting.

The officers, who have not been identified, were ""lucky"" they weren't killed, St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said earlier Thursday. He said they heard ""hear three or four shots ring out"" before the officers were hurt, both of whom were seriously wounded from a shooter standing about 150 feet away.

""We are lucky by God's grace that we didn't lose two police officers,"" he said.

One officer, 41, was struck in the shoulder; the other, 32, in the face, Belmar said.

Belmar said the shots were fired from an undetermined location north or northwest of the Ferguson Police Department building.

The search for the suspect or suspects is the ""number one priority"" within the St. Louis County police department, according to Belmar.

President Obama called the shooting ""unacceptable.""

Violence against police is unacceptable. Our prayers are with the officers in MO. Path to justice is one all of us must travel together. –bo

U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, in a statement released this morning, said, ""This heinous assault on two brave law enforcement officers was inexcusable and repugnant. I condemn violence against any public safety officials in the strongest terms, and the Department of Justice will never accept any threats or violence directed at those who serve and protect our communities. ... Such senseless acts of violence threaten the very reforms that nonviolent protesters in Ferguson and around the country have been working towards for the past several months.""

Holder also said he wished the officers ""a full and speedy recovery.""

""We stand ready to offer any possible aid to an investigation into this incident, including the department's full range of investigative resources. And we will continue to stand unequivocally against all acts of violence against cops whenever and wherever they occur,"" he added.

Tensions simmered in the city on Wednesday night after the resignation of the city’s police chief, Tom Jackson. Hundreds of protesters gathered throughout the night, staring down police officers in riot gear.

A handful of people were arrested. Some people chanted, and other flare-ups were reported, unrest rekindled after a Justice Department report documented widespread racial bias in the city.

1wZJP9I,2015-03-12 00:00:00,Twitter Cracks Down on Revenge Porn - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/twitter-cracks-revenge-porn/story?id=29581794,"Twitter is stepping up its game when it comes to dealing with revenge porn.

The company's updated terms of service states that users are prohibited from posting ""intimate photos or videos that were taken or distributed without the subject's consent.""

Twitter users can report any unauthorized explicit photos of themselves to the company, which will then review and remove the items in question if it is determined they are unauthorized. Users are allowed to appeal if they feel the removal is unwarranted.

After coming under fire for letting trolls flood Twitter, the company affirmed its commitment last year to improving the abuse reporting process. In December, a set of tools for the Twitter app were rolled out, allowing users to easily report abusive behavior and keep track of people they have blocked.

Twitter's crackdown on revenge porn comes as Reddit implemented a new policy on Tuesday banning sexually explicit photos that are posted without the subject's consent. Anyone with an issue can now flag a photo to expedite its removal.

""No matter who you are, if a photograph, video, or digital image of you in a state of nudity, sexual excitement, or engaged in any act of sexual conduct, is posted or linked to on reddit without your permission, it is prohibited on reddit,"" the company's executive team wrote in a post announcing the change. ""We also recognize that violent personalized images are a form of harassment that we do not tolerate and we will remove them when notified."""
1wZKmsv,2015-03-19 00:00:00,"Everything You Want to Know About Palcohol, the Powdered Alcohol Approved by Feds - ABC News",http://abcnews.go.com/Health/palcohol-powdered-alcohol-approved-feds/story?id=29580363,"A product is expected to hit shelves this summer to turn water into wine -- well, into vodka, rum and a few cocktails -- but not everyone is happy about it.

Palcohol, or powdered alcohol, was approved this week by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, part of the U.S. Treasury Department. But the powder packets that can turn water into a mixed drink have already been banned by several states amid fears that Palcohol can be easily abused.

""As a parent, it's one thing to patrol for cases of beer or bottles of booze,"" said ABC News chief health and medical editor Dr. Richard Besser, who is also a pediatrician. ""But having to look for little packets, I worry that it could lead to more underage drinking, making it easier.""

He said he wasn't happy with the federal approval and explained there isn't much the U.S. Food and Drug Administration can do it about it right away. The FDA can only take products like this off shelves if they find a problem, he said.

Here are a few questions ABC News viewers asked Besser on Twitter:

@DrRichardBesser what, if any, rules/regulations are in place to prevent underage ppl from buying the powdered alcohol packets?

As with other alcohol products, people must be 21 years old to drink Palcohol, Besser said. He added that each state handles that with its own system.

@DrRichardBesser what is the ""proof"" of this #Palcohol and would the risk alcohol poisoning be higher?

One Palcohol packet has the same alcohol content as a mixed drink, he said.

@DrRichardBesser are you concerned that Palcohol might be used for things other than consumption?

He said he was. ""We will have to see what happens,"" Besser said.

Though it's not yet on the market, here are a few of the questions the company has already answered.

How do you use it?

You stir a packet of Palcohol into six ounces of liquid, according to Lipsmark, the company that owns Palcohol. To dissolve, it takes a minute of constant stirring, so it wouldn't be easy to spike someone's drink without them knowing, according to the company.

What's the point?

Lipsmark says Palcohol was dreamed up for people who love the outdoors but don't want to travel with heavy alcohol containers -- such as people who are going camping.

Does it come in flavors?

Yes. It comes in vodka, rum, cosmopolitan, ""Powderita"" (a margarita flavor) and lemon drop. All but lemon drop were approved this week.

How about the calorie content?

It's 80 calories per bag, but some are sweetened, Lipsmark said. So a completed drink's calories depend on the mixers added to it.

Is anyone against it?

Yes. Several states, including Alaska, Louisiana, South Carolina, Vermont and Virginia want to prohibit the sale of powdered alcohol.

Can you sneak it into sports and concert venues?

Critics fear that people will sneak the packets into sporting venues, concert halls and schools.

But Lipsmark says the 4-by-6 inch packet would be larger than a small bottle of liquid and therefore harder to sneak in. But they acknowledge when there's a will, there's a way -- but that's the case with any alcohol, not just the powdered variety.

Can you snort it?

Lipsmark says the potential to snort Palcohol has been one of the complaints it's heard, but that Palcohol would be hard to snort. Not only does it have the burn of alcohol, but it would take an hour to snort a ""shot"" of vodka, according to the company's statement this week addressing concerns about the product.

Editor’s note: An earlier version of this story implied that the FDA took Four Loko off store shelves. Phusion Projects, which makes Four Loko, announced their intention to retool their formula before the FDA sent a warning to the company asserting that caffeine added to an alcoholic beverage was an ""unsafe food additive."""
1wZmHZ7,2015-03-12 00:00:00,'Dirty Brigades': US-Trained Iraqi Forces Investigated for War Crimes - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/International/dirty-brigades-us-trained-iraqi-forces-investigated-war/story?id=29193253,"U.S.-trained and armed Iraqi military units, the key to the American strategy against ISIS, are under investigation for committing some of the same atrocities as the terror group, American and Iraqi officials told ABC News. Some Iraqi units have already been cut off from U.S. assistance over ""credible"" human rights violations, according to a senior military official on the Pentagon's Joint Staff.

The investigation, being conducted by the Iraqi government, was launched after officials were confronted with numerous allegations of “war crimes,” based in part on dozens of ghastly videos and still photos that appear to show uniformed soldiers from some of Iraq's most elite units and militia members massacring civilians, torturing and executing prisoners, and displaying severed heads.

“As the ISF [Iraqi Security Forces] and militias reclaim territory, their behavior must be above reproach or they risk being painted with the same brush as ISIL [ISIS] fighters,” said a statement to ABC News from the U.S. government. “If these allegations are confirmed, those found responsible must be held accountable.""

[In an image posted on Instagram, six black-uniformed men who appear to be Iraqi Special Operations Forces from the “Golden Brigades” surround an alleged ISIS suspect who has been dragged with a rope or cable tied to his foot.]

Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, along with international human rights advocates and military experts, called the photos evidence of Iraqi ""war crimes.""

""I guarantee you ultimately we get blamed for it whether we did it or not,"" Leahy predicted.

Under what is known as the Leahy Law, the U.S. is required to cut off funds to any foreign military unit when there is “credible evidence” of human rights violations. In Iraq the responsibility of determination falls to the Department of Defense. In recent Senate testimony, Secretary of State John Kerry confirmed the Iraqi investigation had been ordered and said the Leahy Law applies to units operating alongside the many militias also fighting in Iraq against ISIS.

""I would say that involves the Leahy Law,"" Leahy recently told ABC News after viewing the shocking imagery. “And I'd argue that we should be withholding money.""

According to the Pentagon, the U.S. already has. In a statement to ABC News, the Joint Staff official revealed that in the months since the U.S. began airstrikes and military assistance to Iraq last August, “We have withheld assistance from certain Iraqi units on the basis of credible information in the past. Due to the sensitive nature of our security assistance, we are unable to discuss specific units.”

In Washington today, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Gen. Martin Dempsey told lawmakers the U.S. military is keeping a close eye on the militias as well.

""What we are watching carefully is whether the militias -- they call themselves the popular mobilization forces -- whether when they recapture lost territory, whether they engage in acts of retribution and ethnic cleansing,"" he said.

An Iraqi government spokesperson previously said while the dozens of photos could be ISIS propaganda, a full investigation was warranted.

“Yes, of course we will investigate these pictures,” the spokesperson, Gen. Saad Maan, said in an interview in Baghdad as he viewed a selection of images provided by ABC News.

""We don't have anything to hide,” the general said. “We don't have anything to be in, let's say, in a black corner.""

[A bound and blindfolded detainee appears to be dropped – or possibly hung from the neck according to one analyst -- from what looks like an Iraqi military base guard tower. The image was posted on Instagram.]

The Iraqi military is key to the U.S. strategy to fight ISIS and stop its atrocities, which have outraged the world. The U.S. is shipping almost $1 billion in weapons, as well as providing U.S. military trainers to instruct new Iraqi recruits. A special operations official in Baghdad, however, said it’s the government of Iraq that decides — not the Pentagon — which Iraqi units get U.S.-donated weapons, such as 43,000 M4 rifles and thousands of other light infantry weapons Congress approved for shipment in December. American troops are not known to be operating on the ground in combat in Iraq or Syria. No Americans are shown in the images or footage ABC News has found, nor have any Americans been implicated in any of the alleged atrocities.

Officials from Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International who reviewed the library of horrors assembled in the ABC News investigation said it is rare to see so much visual evidence of human rights abuses.

""Usually when forces commit such crimes they try to hide them. What we are seeing here is a brazen, proud display of these terrible crimes,"" Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East Executive Director at Human Rights Watch, said in an interview as she and the group's lead investigator in Iraq, Erin Evers, surveyed the carnage.

ABC News came upon the first such images last September, when a reporter following personal Instagram accounts of Iraqi counter-terrorism troops spotted a video of a handcuffed prisoner shot in the head by a man in camouflage -- which more than 600 users ""liked."" The English and Arabic captions by a self-identified member of the Iraqi security forces said, “We have arrested this terrorist yesterday and we killed him after completion of interrogation.""

A separate photo posted in September showed the severed head of a long-haired and bearded alleged ISIS fighter lashed to the grill of a U.S.-donated Humvee bearing an Iraqi Army license plate. A second related photo eventually surfaced of what appeared to be an Iraqi Army soldier holding up the same severed head next to the gun truck. Desecration of war dead and extrajudicial killings are violations of the Geneva Conventions.

""You don’t behead someone and place their head on the front of your Humvee. That’s unacceptable -- because it’s a war crime. And it’s an atrocity,"" retired U.S. Army Special Forces Lt. Col. James Gavrilis told ABC News.

As a senior officer in 5th Special Forces Group in Iraq a decade ago, Gavrilis was deeply involved in counterinsurgency during the U.S. war and creating Iraqi counter-terrorism units from Special Forces and special police teams.

""I think it’s horrible. I think this really shows a failure of our policy for Iraq,"" Gavrilis said, confirming that the imagery looked authentic and too plentiful online to be faked.

""Both sides are committing war crimes,"" he said. ""This is widespread, it’s endemic.""

[A man wearing a uniform with a patch that appears to be from the Emergency Response Brigade steps on two severed heads in a photo posted on Instagram.]

In another video posted online in October, two unarmed civilians are shot to death after being questioned, and denying, whether they were part of ISIS. When the camera pans to one man with a gun, he appears to be wearing a uniform and shoulder patch of Iraqi Special Forces, with Iraqi Army officers also nearby observing the atrocity.

Fighters who appear to be a mix of militia and army appearing in a separate 78-second video circulating in January — including some wearing Iraqi flags and Iraqi Special Forces patches — take pictures of a captured teenaged boy who appears terrified. “Didn’t you just shoot?” demands one fighter. The handcuffed boy, shoved to the ground, insists, “No, no, I did not shoot a single bullet.”

The men argue over whether to kill him, some asking the others to calm down, but they shoot him to death anyway as the sound of mortars and gunfire nearby punctuate the crime. “This is to avenge the martyrs,” one man says.

“I've seen all sorts of horrible things over the years... but I have never seen anything this bad in my life,” said Ali Khedery, an American former diplomat in Baghdad who advised five U.S. ambassadors in the Iraqi capital and three generals overseeing Middle East operations at U.S. Central Command.

Khedery recently wrote in Foreign Policy about another video, where a man was beaten and machine gunned to death by a gang who appeared to be both militias and Iraqi Special Forces with U.S.-donated M4A1 rifles. He said the video slaughter of the Iraqis accused by their killers of smuggling weapons for ISIS was far worse, because Iraqi government troops were present.

“It was the shooting of unarmed men. This is a U.S.-backed government. They carried U.S. weapons,” he said.

U.S. and Iraqi authorities say they have been working to fully authenticate the content posted online on sites such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter connected to the Iraqi military. The uniforms and insignia of Iraqi Special Operations Forces under the command of Baghdad’s Counter-Terrorism Forces as well as special police and Emergency Response units from the Ministry of the Interior are clearly identifiable in many of the photos and videos, which include many severed heads and corpses dragged behind humvees.

Gen. Maan, the Iraqi government spokesperson, claimed the patches identifying Iraqi military units could be bought on Iraqi streets and that the gruesome images could be a clever ploy by ISIS to discredit the Iraqi military.

[The patches worn by the men in one of the photos posted to Instagram appear to match the patches of the Iraqi Emergency Response Brigade (E.R.B.), a counter-terrorism unit within the Ministry of Interior.]

""It does not look like ISIS propaganda at all,"" Gavrilis said. ""I don’t know how we could support them, if they are spearheading a lot on the front lines alongside these militias, and if they are conducting these kinds of atrocities as well... These Shi’a militias are just as barbaric as ISIS.""

Some militias take pride in their atrocities and appear to often be calling the shots on the battlefield, not the government forces, BloombergView columnist Eli Lake found when he recently visited the front lines north of Baghdad.

Officials said that the State Department's human rights observers and military intelligence had viewed examples of Iraqi Security Forces posting atrocities on personal social media for over a year. But one knowledgeable U.S. official said that since ABC News began asking about the many disturbing images last fall, the atrocities allegations against Iraq’s fighting forces have grown “more severe” and the “very concerning” allegations are being raised at high levels in Baghdad.

The Pentagon spokesperson told ABC News the U.S. military has ""discussed with Iraqi leaders the paramount importance of maintaining high standards of conduct and protecting civilian populations of all sects.""

""The actions of a small minority, if left unchecked, could do serious harm to the efforts of the Iraqi government,"" the spokesperson said.

With several thousand American troops back in Iraq as trainers, the alleged atrocities by Iraqi troops puts U.S. military commanders in the unenviable position of having to sort out which units are clean or dirty, Gavrilis said.

[The severed head of an alleged ISIS fighter is being held up by a desert camouflage-uniformed individual in front of a Humvee in this image uploaded to Instagram. Patches on his uniform match those often worn by the Iraqi Army.]

The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights last month released a report on Iraq that both condemned ISIS for its campaign of killings verging on genocide, but also criticized Iraqi Security Forces for military operations that ""which may have amounted to war crimes.""

Last March, the State Department's Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor also issued its own damning report on Iraq, stating that government officials under then-Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki committed ""extrajudicial killings"" -- meaning battlefield executions of ISIS suspects and killing individuals in custody without trial.

""Ministry of Interior officials tortured detainees to death, according to reports from multiple government officials and human rights organizations,"" read the annual report. The Bureau explicitly fingered the Iraqi Counter-Terrorism Forces and Interior Ministry's special police units -- which the U.S. established, trained and armed from 2003-2011, and whose troops are seen in many of the atrocities images.

But the State report was issued before the U.S. began airstrikes in Iraq last August to assist security forces in successfully retaking the Mosul Dam, and long before President Obama deployed thousands of American infantrymen, special operations forces and enablers back into Iraq beginning last fall to assist the Iraqis in fighting ISIS. A new report is expected soon, officials said.

Now that the alleged war crimes of the U.S.-backed forces have become public, the Iraqi spokesman stressed that his government will not tolerate “bad behavior.”

Using the Arabic slang for ISIS, Gen. Maan said, ""We do not allow any person to be a savage like Daesh.""

At least eight monkeys at the Tulane National Primate Center in New Orleans initially tested positive for exposure to burkholderia pseudomallei, a potentially deadly form of bacteria more commonly found in Southeast Asia and Northern Australia.

A federal investigator also tested positive for being exposed to the bacteria, but in that case it wasn't clear if he was exposed at the center or during a visit to an infected region, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

But blood tests from an animal clinic employee at the center showed current or prior exposure to the dangerous bacteria, Tulane officials announced Wednesday. However, the antibodies found in the blood that indicate the positive reading were still very low and the employee showed no symptoms, Tulane officials said, adding that the readings were so low they were within the levels sometimes found among members of the public with no exposure.

As a result, the CDC is scheduled to conduct additional tests to confirm the initial result.

Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, said burkholderia pseudomallei is an usual bacteria because it can remain dormant for a long time and it can infect different organs in the body.

""It causes all sorts of different infections depending upon the part of the body that it sets up shop in,"" including tuberculosis, said Schaffner. An infected person can be without symptoms for a long time and then the infection can ""suddenly come to the fore and create an illness.""

In the case the Tulane employee, the person might have already fought off the infection or the bacteria could be multiplying and eventually cause a full-blown infection with symptoms, Schaffner said. Continued blood tests should reveal if the infection is expected to get worse and doctors can then try a cocktail of antibiotics to treat the infection, he said.

CDC officials have said there is no risk to the public from the outbreak. It's unclear how the bacteria from the high-tech security lab at the research center initially infected the primates.

Clad in black, the players took the field arm-in-arm Thursday afternoon and stood silently for several minutes before speaking with the media.

""This is an instance in which we feel like we have the opportunity to step up and promote that change,"" said quarterback Trevor Knight. He was among those players and coaches who posted a statement saying the team had not practiced this week and asked that the university continue its investigation into the executive board of the fraternity.

""It turned our stomachs and our hearts,"" added linebacker Eric Striker. ""It really hurt all of us.""

The university closed the SAE house on campus and expelled two students after the video emerged earlier this week, which shows fraternity members chanting, “There will never be a n***** at SAE” and also referred to lynchings and keeping African-Americans out of the fraternity.

""These types of incidents occur nationwide every single year, and our hope is to shed light on this issue and promote meaningful change at a national level,"" read the statement posted to Knight's and several others' Twitter accounts.

""The chant was not invented by the two that led it, but was taught to underclassmen by people of higher authority,"" the statement continued. ""Being a student at the University of Oklahoma is a privilege, and allowing this culture to thrive is against everything it means to be a Sooner. Ignorance is no excuse.""

Head coach Bob Stoops echoed his support for his players.

""This kind of stance is more important than practice,"" said Stoops. ""They want to affect change around the country, not just here.""

The university also issued a statement today, saying President David Boren planned to meet with the captains of the football team following spring break. He also asked the vice president of student affairs to investigate each officer of the fraternity to ""determine their responsibility and to make recommendations on appropriate disciplinary action.""

Lily Groesbeck survived hours in a wrecked car in freezing temperatures before being rescued by first responders Saturday. The car was found partially in the Spanish Fork River, outside Salt Lake City, Utah, with water so frigid rescuers could only stay in it a few moments at time. Her mother, who was driving, did not survive.

After being rescued, 18-month-old Lily was initially taken to Primary Children's Hospital in Salt Lake City in stable condition. The video shows Lily, prior to her release from the hospital on Wednesday, playing with her father and singing along to ""The Wheels on the Bus.""

""Her improvement is astounding. Right now she's watching Dora and singing 'Wheels on the Bus' with Grandpa,"" Lily's aunt Jill Sanderson wrote on the family's fundraising page earlier this week. ""She is smiling and laughing for family members. We're blown away by Lily's progress and so grateful to her rescuers.""

A Libyan government source told ABC News of the U.S. citizen's death, and it later was confirmed by the U.S. State Department.

""We can confirm the death of a U.S. citizen in Libya,"" a senior State Department official said. ""We have no additional details to share at this time.""

A member of the hotel’s staff told The Associated Press that ""five masked gunmen wearing bulletproof vests stormed the hotel after security guards at the hotel's gate tried to stop them. ... They entered the hotel and fired randomly at the staff in the lobby.""

The staff member also claimed ""the gunmen fired in his direction when he opened his door to look out. He said he joined the rest of the staff and foreign guests fleeing out the hotel's back doors into the parking lot. When they got there, he said a car bomb exploded in the parking lot, only 100 meters [109 yards] away.""

Security services told the AFP they managed to surround the gunman on the 23rd floor of the hotel, which is when the men then detonated their explosives.

An eyewitness described the harrowing attack to the BBC, saying, ""I suddenly heard shots and saw people running towards me, and we all escaped from the back [of the hotel] through the underground garage. The hotel did a lockdown after that.""

Images purportedly showing the gunmen from the hotel's surveillance video have shown up on social media, but there has been no official confirmation on who the attackers were. a Twitter account affiliated with ISIS claimed responsibility, saying the attack on the Corinthia Hotel was in revenge for the death of a Libyan jihadist by the name of Abu Anas al Libi. Al Libi was linked to the bombings of two U.S. embassies in East Africa in 1998."

Andrew Crain, 15, helped to thwart the alleged kidnapping by running after the suspect who had allegedly snatched a 22-month-old toddler from his stroller. The screams of the toddler's 8-year-old sister Delicia Wright and 10-year-old brother Brenden Wright drew Crain's attention, who went after the suspect along with his friend Isaac Yow.

The suspect eventually put down the toddler, who was unharmed, and ran off.

On Wednesday a 15-year-old resident was arrested for the crime. Crain told ABC News affiliate KXLY-TV he has mixed emotions about the incident.

The unnamed teenager was arrested by Lincoln County Sheriff's Office late Wednesday for the attempted kidnapping. Police said the arrest was made after an intense investigation and after the toddler's siblings identified the man from a photo montage.

Isaac Yow, another teen who helped run down the suspected kidnapper, told KXLY-TV he knew the alleged kidnapper and had seen him earlier that day.

""I did see him walking the day of the incident but we didn't bother and go catch up with him,"" Yow said. ""He just looked like he normally would.""

The suspect apparently wore a disguise during the attempted abduction to mask his identity, the Associated Press reported.

Diana Yow, Issac Yow's grandmother, said her grandson was in the same freshman class as the suspect.

""The freshman class is just seven or eight kids,"" she said of the high school. ""I think there’s 31 or 41 students,"" total.

Residents of Sprague, Washington, a close-knit town of approximately 500 people, were stunned by the news that the alleged kidnapper was a local resident.

“I know it’s very unsettling for everyone to know that it’s your next door neighbor more or less,"" Diana Yow told ABC News. ""It’s very unsettling to know they have been right here.”

The teen suspect, who was not identified, was charged Wednesday with kidnapping, second degree and booked into a juvenile facility.

A spokesperson for the prosecutor's office said today that the suspect was still in custody and a hearing had not yet been scheduled in the case.

The call was made just past midnight April 19, four days after two bombs ripped through the finish line of the Boston Marathon, killing three people and injuring 260 others.

The Boston man, Dun Meng, recounted his harrowing experience that followed when he took the stand today in the trial of alleged bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev.

Meng testified that he had pulled over on the side of a road in Brighton, Mass. to send a friend a text message when someone knocked on his passenger-side window and motioned for him to roll down the window. When he did, the hand reached through the window, opened the door and the man, later identified as Dzhokhar’s older brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev, climbed in with a gun.

“He point a gun at me,” Meng told the court, “at my head.”

After Meng gave Tamerlan around $45, Tamerlan demanded he drive. At some point Tamerlan pulled the magazine out of the gun and shows Meng a lone bullet inside saying, “I’m serious. Don’t be stupid.”

Meng still thought he could be the victim of a simple robbery until Tamerlan asked him the next question: “Do you know the Boston Marathon explosion?”

Meng said he answered, nervously, “Yes, I do.”

“Do you know who did it?” Tamerlan said. Meng told the court he said, “No I don’t.” Tamerlan then blurted, “I did it.”

Later Dzhokhar, who had been in another vehicle, joined them in the car and Tamerlan switched seats with Meng.

The three stopped at a bank where Dzhokhar got Meng’s bank PIN number and stole $800 from his account, Meng said.

Later there was a tense moment, Meng remembered, when his roommate called his cell phone and then texted him in Mandarin. Tamerlan demanded a translation. Meng gave it to him. “Where are you? It’s dangerous outside,” she had written.

Tamerlan asked him how to say “No” in Manderin and Meng told him. Tamerlan was suspicious and asked Meng for an English-to-Mandarin dictionary, which was an app on his phone. Meng gave it to him and Tamerlan responded to the roommate’s text.

That prompted a phone call from another roommate, boyfriend of the first. Tamerlan pulled out the gun again and for a second time points it at Meng’s head telling him, “You have to answer the phone right now. If you say any single word in Chinese I will kill you right now.” Tamerlan instructs him to tell the caller that he is staying out because he is not feeling well.

Meng testified, “I pick up the phone answer in English, ‘How you doing?’ Which is very weird because my roommates are Chinese too… I say, ‘I feel sick. I am going to stay at friend’s house.'""

“What?” Meng’s roommate answered in Chinese. “Why are you speaking English?”

Meng says, in English again, “I’m staying at a friend’s house. I have to go right now,” and hangs up.

Tamerlan, Meng testified, looked “more relaxed,” and tells Meng, “Good job, boy. Good job.”"

She blames what she says is the church's policy of silence on child abusers.

Candace Conti, now 28, was just 9 years old when she says she was abused by a well-liked member of her small congregation in Fremont, California, named Jonathan Kendrick. While doing door-to-door evangelizing, which Conti said she would often do without her parents, she said Kendrick would take her to his house and molest her.

“He's just a big person... I found him very scary,” Conti said.

As a child, Conti said she didn’t think she could tell anyone about the abuse. But years later, she testified during a trial against the church that Kendrick abused her several times a month for what she says felt like two years.

“I never thought I could [talk about it],” she said. “Bringing that up just would demolish my family-- the only people that I knew... I think I was scared to.”

Conti had nowhere else to turn, she said, because of her beliefs, and she grew up isolated from the outside world.

Like all Jehovah’s Witnesses, Conti says she was taught that Armageddon was imminent, and that only the true believers would survive and live in a heaven on Earth. She says she was taught that, “everybody outside of the Jehovah's Witnesses are pretty much walking dead ... and could be used as a tool by Satan to mislead you, to pull your away from your Christian family.”

It was only years later, after Conti had grown up and left the church, that she found Jonathan Kendrick on a sex offender registry. He had served seven months in jail for sexually abusing his wife’s 7-year-old granddaughter. After seeing him on the registry, Conti decided to come forward with her case.

She said she “felt really guilty for not doing anything that this wouldn’t have happened to somebody else.”

Conti said she went to local church leaders, known as elders, and told them her story. But Conti said the elders refused to believe her unless she could prove the abuse happened by providing two witnesses to the alleged abuse.

According to the religion’s internal system of justice, it is believed that the Bible requires there to be two witnesses in order for a crime to be punishable.

So Conti went to the police instead. They began an investigation, but with Kendrick denying the abuse, the authorities have not brought charges -- although the investigation continues.

Conti’s next move was to sue the church itself. She hired attorney Rick Simons, who had spent many years representing victims in cases of abuse by pedophile Catholic priests.

“If ever there was a group that needs the sun to shine on them and their practices, it's this one [Jehovah's Witnesses],"" Simons said. “Because when your doorbell rings on Saturday morning… and your kid answers the door, you don't want that guy to be a child molester.”

When Conti and her attorney began conducting depositions with local church leaders in California, they learned something that astonished them: Even before Conti was abused, the elders knew that Jonathan Kendrick, who had then held a leadership position in the congregation, had also molested his stepdaughter when she was a teenager.

And yet, the elders did not call the police and did not warn the rest of the congregation."

A 55-year-old woman from Poland “probably did not hear the plane sliding down behind her,” Steinmetz said.

She was attended by emergency doctors before being taken to hospital by helicopter.

While the pilot was a professional used to taking off and flying in tricky weather conditions, an investigation has been opened to determine if he is responsible for causing non-voluntary harm.

The accident prompted the closure of the ski track until the end of May, though the resort remains open."

“I feel that the Lord has placed me here for a short time, and nothing more,” he added, comparing the feeling to “a gambler who convinces himself he will lose so he won’t be disappointed. And if he wins, he’s happy.”

The day that celebrates the mathematical constant pi is Saturday. And because it's 2015, this particular sequence of numbers in the calendar that matches pi -- 3/14/15 -- won't come around for another century.

While the mathematical constant, which represents the ratio of circumference of a circle divided by its diameter, is often abbreviated as 3.14 for convenience, pi actually has an infinite number of digits beyond the decimal point, starting with 3.141592653.

So, expect a good deal of celebration at 9:26 a.m. at 53 seconds -- with the pastry pie, for obvious phonetic and geometrical reasons.

In fact, there will be a point between 9:26 a.m. 53 seconds and 54 seconds that the clock matches the number pi down to an infinite number of digits.

And as befitting its reputation as an elite institution of math, science and engineering, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has announced that it will send out its acceptance letters for this year's incoming class on Pi Day, precisely at 9:26 a.m.

That should round out the day -- at least for those accepted."

University officials have expelled two students over the incident, severed ties to the fraternity chapter and ordered its members out of their fraternity house. The national SAE organization is in the process of attempting to expel members of the Oklahoma SAE chapter after previously suspending them, an official with the national group said today, according to The Associated Press.

“We need to avoid a rush to judgment, we need to lower our voices, and we need to take a breath,” said the SAE chapter lawyer, Stephen Jones, who previously has represented Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh.

Jones said he has been hired by alumni members who served on the board of the university's local SAE chapter, but does not represent the two suspended fraternity members who allegedly were shown on a video leading a racist chant.

He had only recently been hired and still was getting fully up to speed on the case, he said, but, ""obviously, there are issues about First Amendment rights, due process and real estate issues, but we're still gathering documents.""

Jones said university officials, including the university president, David Boren, should have deployed ""a more measured response"" to the video, but declined to cite a specific example of what he thought the university did wrong in its handling of the case.

He also objected to a general atmosphere that, he said, has resulted in “the painting of a fraternity ... with a tar brush as bigots.”

Boren has said the students who played a leadership role in the ""exclusionary"" chant had created a hostile learning environment. He said the chant was heard not only by those on a bus, but also affected the entire university community because it was distributed through social media.

As of now, Jones hopes to reach a ""non-litigation"" solution with officials in the SAE case, he said.

“We believe that working together in a positive manner, we can find a solution that is acceptable to everyone to make this a teachable moment,” Jones added.

After Jones spoke, the national SAE organization put out a statement noting it was “not involved in retaining Mr. Jones and, as of now, we have no further information about his intentions.

""Our priority now remains squarely focused on making sure we continue to proactively address this issue in a way that reflects our zero-tolerance for any kind of discrimination and upholds the values of our fraternity,"" the statement added, in part. ""We teach our members to serve as role models in their communities and to live up to our creed, 'The True Gentleman.' As such, when members fail to do so -- as they did at the University of Oklahoma -- we do not hesitate to take corrective action, starting with closing the chapter and initiating a process to take action against any members who were involved."""

Caesar, the pseudonym of a defector from the Syrian army, smuggled over 55,000 photos out of Syria and of those, at least 11,000 documented deaths that occurred to victims under detainment, according to The Coalition for a Democratic Syria.

Michele J. Sison, U.S. deputy representative to the United Nations, stated that “There is no vocabulary that captures what the victims portrayed in [the images] felt before their excruciatingly painful deaths. We know that it is far easier to walk rapidly down this corridor, far easier to look away, but I encourage you to stop and take a moment and look at these men, these women, and children. These images are the graphic depiction of how the Assad regime treats its citizens.”

The photos below show reactions from some of the viewers who did not walk past or look away, but stopped to take in this exhibition."

A $30,000 reward was offered for information that leads to an arrest in the death of Edith Sax. She was found last year face down in the pool of her Houston home while wearing her scrubs and lab coat.

For more than five months, authorities thought her death was an accident. But new revelations in the case suggest otherwise, said Vashawnda McLean, lead investigator with the Houston Police Department.

“Edith Sax sustained some injuries in this incident that would be suggestive of her being forced under the water,” McLean said.

Investigators say two unidentified men were seen near her home around the time of her death.

Steve Sax, the victim’s husband, has been cleared by police as a suspect. Both he and police believe the killer would stand to gain from the inheritance she left behind.

“I cannot write a huge check into a trust for someone who killed my wife,” Steve Sax said.

The couple married nine years ago. Sax, 50, had four children from a previous marriage, while he had three. Steve Sax said the family quickly blended and bonded.

“Edie was the most fierce defender of her children. She loved them utterly,” he said.

Natasha Rafiq, the victim’s daughter, hopes that someone comes forward with any clues.

“Please help us to have a little bit of peace,” she said."

The student, Morgan Ball, 17, said he was wearing a white t-shirt with a black shawl over it, jeans, a fashion belt and lace gloves. He also had on jewelry and make-up.

The hashtag #ClothingHasNoGender was then started by his friends at Lee's Summit North High School to support rights of self-expression. The hashtag has also been printed on shirts and decals, which fellow students are buying to show their solidarity with Morgan.

""The support has been tremendous,"" Morgan's dad Jason Ball told ABC News today. ""What could have been the worst birthday in his life turned into the best birthday of his life.

Morgan's mom, Cheri Ball, took to Facebook last weekend to express her concern after what happened on her son's 17th birthday.

Cheri said her son was a proud, gay, young man who ""expresses himself with a fun flair for fashion,"" and then explained a school administrator called Morgan to his office to ""address [Morgan's] appearance.""

""Apparently, some students and staff members complained his outfit was 'distracting,'"" Cheri wrote, ""and instead of taking the opportunity to educate those individuals about Morgan's right to self-expression, she asked him to remove his beaded shrug, lace gloves and fashion belt.""

One of the assistant principals asked Morgan, ""Do you have a gender identity issue?"" and ""Are you aware that you're wearing women's clothing?"" Morgan told ABC News today.

""It came off homophobic, and I was very offended,"" Morgan said. ""Those questions didn't need to be asked, especially because people know I'm very confident and comfortable with myself.""

Nonetheless, he took the accessories off but decided to put them back on a little later because he wasn't violating the dress code, Morgan said. However, he said he was called a second time back to the office and because he was scared, he removed the items again.

Morgan's friends saw how upset he was at the end of the day but were determined to make his what was turning into a ""crappy"" birthday better, he said.

The family discovered Morgan's friends were using the hashtag #ClothingHasNoGender on social media later that night, and they even printed t-shirts made to express their outrage and offer support.

One of Morgan's friends, Lizzy Wrisinger, wrote a blog post on the incident and was interviewed in a student-made video promoting the hashtag #ClothingHasNoGender.

""A lot of the students have been backing him up and supporting him through it,"" she said in the video. ""You should never judge a book from its cover.""

The Lee's Summit R-7 School District told ABC News today in a statement that they could not ""comment on specific student issues"" but did say there were ""no students sent home or assigned discipline for dress code violations at Lee's Summit North High School on Friday, March 13,"" and that ""no parents have contacted the school principal with concerns regarding a dress code issue from Friday.""

Morgan's family met with school administrators Wednesday afternoon, his dad Jason said, adding that it was very positive, and they concentrated on finding ways to make sure Morgan and other LGBTQ students could feel comfortable and safe at school.

""They said he didn't violate any of the dress code policy except for one rule mentioning students couldn't wear anything 'distracting,' which is a really subjective term,"" Morgan's dad said. ""We're going to work with the school to change the dress code policy's language, so all students can feel comfortable wearing what they want as long as it's not offensive or disrespectful.""

Next Monday, Morgan said students at the school will be wearing the t-shirt with the logo #ClothingHasNoGender, and on Tuesday, he and his friends are encouraging students to participate in 'Gender Swap Day.' They're asking guys to wear feminine clothing and girls to wear masculine clothing to shatter societal expectations of what males and females should look like, he said."

Ahmed Al-Jumaili, 36, had recently moved to Dallas from Iraq when he was shot dead in the parking lot of Walnut Bend Apartments complex late Wednesday night.

The Dallas Police Department said the shooting took place at 11:40 pm, when Al-Jamaili and his wife were taking photos of the first snowfall he had ever seen.

Police are asking for help from the public identifying the individuals seen in the video released Saturday night. In the surveillance video you can see four people walking past the camera individually.

Crimestoppers offered $5,000 for information that leads to an arrest.

The fundraising appeal tells the love story of Al-Jumaili and his wife, Zahara, who got married 16 months ago.

""It is heartbreaking to know that Zahara won't get to experience life's milestones with her Ahmed. Hard to believe that their time together, as husband and wife, started just 16 months ago, and has now tragically ended so suddenly,"" the fundraising site said."

President Baldwin Lonsdale told the Associated Press Monday that the cyclone was a “monster.” Lonsdale, who had been attending a disaster conference in Japan, appealed for international aid.

""This is a very devastating cyclone in Vanuatu. I term it as a monster, a monster,"" he said. ""It's a setback for the government and for the people of Vanuatu. After all the development that has taken place, all this development has been wiped out.""

At least six people have died, but responders with Oxfam Humanitarian Emergency in Australia – who are flying to Vanuatu for relief efforts – expect that number to significantly climb.

Oxfam Australia Executive Director Helen Szoke discussed the scale of the impact in a statement.

“It’s becoming increasingly clear that we are now dealing with worse than the worst case scenario in Vanuatu,” Szoke said.

Video and surveillance images show uprooted trees and flooded fields as residents await disaster relief supplies.

At least half of the population, or about 130,000 people, has been affected, according to the Vanuatu Red Cross Society. UNICEF estimates that at least 60,000 children across the country in the South Pacific Ocean could be at risk.

Vanuatu has a population of 267,000 people spread over 65 islands. About 47,000 people live in the capital of Port Vila.

1x7FDz9,2015-03-09 00:00:00,Madison Tense as City Deals With Police Shooting of Unarmed Teen - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/US/madison-tense-city-deals-police-shooting-unarmed-teen/story?id=29477922,"Emotions were raw today at a church service to mourn the death of an unarmed 19-year-old black man shot by a white Madison, Wisconsin, police officer, but demonstrations on the city's streets were tense but peaceful.

Protesters faced off with police today outside the house where Tony Robinson was shot Friday night, and marchers carried banners saying ""Black Lives Matter.""

A community group planned to gather this afternoon to discuss the shooting. Organizers encouraged the community to bring children and crayons for a discussion about the events of the weekend.

A balloon memorial had been placed near the site of the shooting this morning.

Friends and family who gather Saturday night in front of the home where Robinson was shot told ABC News they were concerned about safety in their community.

""I worry about my kids even walking down the street,"" Lynn Robinson, a neighbor of Tony Robinson's, said.

""Us being teenagers and you know African American teenagers, you know it can happen to us,"" Darian Grant, a classmate of Robinson's, said.

Madison Police Chief Mike Koval identified the officer who shot and killed Robinson Friday night as Matt Kenny, 45, a 12-year veteran of the force.

Kenny was involved in a shooting in 2007, but was exonerated, Koval said.

Robinson's mother Andrea Irwin said she was shocked by his violent death, saying the teen was never a ""violent person.""

""It baffles me,"" she said.

According to court documents obtained by ABC News, Robinson pleaded guilty to charges of being a party to armed robbery in April 2014, and was under supervision when police responded to a complaint about him Friday night.

Robinson was jumping in and out of traffic on Friday night and allegedly responsible for a recent battery, Koval said.

In recordings of the 911 calls, police dispatchers discussing the suspect ""yelling and jumping in front of cars"" call him ""Tony.""

Kenny went to an apartment where he thought Robinson had gone, Koval said. The officer heard a disturbance inside and entered, where an altercation with Robinson began, the police chief said.

Koval said Kenny then shot Robinson, who later died at the hospital.

Kenny was also injured, said Koval, but he did not describe the extent of his wounds. The officer, who was involved in a police-involved shooting in 2007 and was exonerated of any wrongdoing, was placed on administrative leave with pay pending the outcome of the investigation, Koval said.

After Robinson's death late Friday, demonstrations condemning the shooting began. A crowd gathered at the house where the shooting happened and then left. Some people then headed to the downtown building that houses the Madison Police Department's Central District offices.

Robinson's family has urged demonstrators to remain peaceful in his honor.

1x7icvH,2015-03-16 00:00:00,"Why Taking Over the 'Daily Show' Would Be Hard, Even for 'Egypt's Jon Stewart' - ABC News",http://abcnews.go.com/International/taking-daily-show-hard-egypts-jon-stewart/story?id=29652544,"He’s the megastar you might not have heard of: Bassem Youssef is known as “The Jon Stewart of Egypt,” a wildly popular Egyptian political satirist.

Youssef was the face of the groundbreaking show “Al Bernameg,” averaging an audience of 40 million viewers each week and becoming the most-watched show in the history of Egyptian TV.

Could this irreverent Middle Easterner be in line to host “The Daily Show” on Comedy Central? Youssef eschewed the idea, telling ABC News’ David Wright Stewart will leave “huge shoes to fill,” and joking that it would be “the worst rebound ever, like a bad rebound boyfriend for the show.”

But why not Youssef? He already has the seal of approval from Stewart, who has called his pioneering comedy “heroic.” The 40-year-old points to the U.S. audience.

“First of all, I don't think Americans are ready for a Middle Easterner like me to lecture them all on political satire. We need to cross a bridge and then maybe wait another fifty years,” he said. “Like the civil rights movements, they have a black president fifty years later, so we can have a Middle Eastern satirist fifty years from now. At that time I will be ninety years old.”

Despite the fame, Youssef’s show was taken off the air in Egypt. But, he says, not for lack of laughter.

“The whole show was hilarious. People were laughing their asses off,” he said. “I think because we were too funny I think we were banned.”

A cardiac surgeon by trade, Youssef rose to popularity after the Arab Spring.

“I was like a regular everyday-life heart surgeon,” he explained. “And suddenly I had a revolution and they were out on the streets and I was doing my part helping the wounded people of Tahrir Square.”

With the help of a friend, Youssef decided he would “do Jon Stewart on the Internet.” He worked out of his laundry room and says he only expected about 10,000 views – but in mere months, his routine had been seen 5 million times. That led to his television show, and multiple appearances on “The Daily Show.”

In a 2013 appearance, Jon Stewart told Youssef he was “carving out the space for people to breathe and express themselves in a way that I think is incredibly admirable.”

Youssef says his admiration for Stewart goes beyond hero worship, telling ABC News, “This guy is not just an idol, he’s a brother.”

He may not be hosting these days, but Youssef is still plenty busy. He’s a fellow at Harvard’s Institute of Politics and is working on a documentary about satire and free speech in the Middle East, titled ""Tickling Giants.""

But if he were hosting, would he find room for humor in some of the world biggest headlines, including ISIS?

“Look at YouTube in the Middle East. People are making fun of ISIS left right and center.”

Looks like Youssef is well on his way to a second act."
1x7K7pq,2015-03-08 00:00:00,Planet Fitness Revokes Woman's Membership After She Complained About Transgender Person - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Health/planet-fitness-revokes-womans-membership-transgender-complaint/story?id=29465983,"A Michigan woman's Planet Fitness membership was revoked after she complained about a transgender person in the women's locker room.

Yvette Cormier, a 48, said she was walking into the Midland Planet Fitness locker room last Saturday when she saw someone ""dressed like a man.""

The person was wearing a wig and ""a little bit of blush,"" but was ""huge"" and appeared ""very manly,"" Cormier told ABC News today.

""I just stopped right there in my tracks,"" she said. ""It was a man for sure.""

Cormier, who had been a Planet Fitness member for two months, said she went to the front desk immediately. The man at the desk told her that
Planet Fitness policy is ""whatever gender you feel you are, that's the locker room you're allowed to go in,"" she said.

""And then he said, 'We've had lots of complaints about him but we told him to go change in a stall,'"" Cormier said.

""He said, 'if you're uncomfortable with that you can wait until he's done in there,'"" she said. ""I stood back and said, 'How about he waits until I'm done in the women's locker room. Or get a unisex bathroom.' He asked if I would like to talk to the manager and I said, 'I'm calling corporate.'""

When she called the corporate offices, she said, someone there confirmed that the person at the front desk was correct about Planet Fitness policies.

""I wouldn't have signed up for this gym if I knew that ahead of time,"" Cormier said, adding that the gym is ""failing to protect me if anything happens in those locker rooms with a man.""

She said she went back to the gym the next few days and ""told everyone in the locker room what happened."" She said everyone she talked to ""was appalled.""

On Thursday, Cormier said, Planet Fitness Corporate called and revoked her membership immediately.

""They said, 'You are talking to people about him in the women's locker room. You are making people upset.' That's my whole point,"" she said. ""I'm telling them and warning them because you are not doing that. You allow men in there, and we are appalled by it.""

Planet Fitness Director of Public Relations McCall Gosselin said the gym is ""committed to creating a non-intimidating, welcoming environment for our members. Our gender identity non-discrimination policy states that members and guests may use all gym facilities based on their sincere self-reported gender identity.""

The statement continued, ""The manner in which this member expressed her concerns about the policy exhibited behavior that management at the Midland club deemed inappropriate and disruptive to other members, which is a violation of the membership agreement and as a result her membership was cancelled.""

Gosselin added, ""As our statement outlines, her membership was not cancelled as a result of complaints about our policy, as we welcome all feedback from our members. Rather, it was the manner in which her concerns were expressed that club management felt was inappropriate, which resulted in the cancellation."""

The video quickly gained visibility online. It was obtained and posted to Twitter by Unheard, which describes itself as ""an alliance of black students organized for change within campus administration and atmosphere."" The video shows young men on a bus chanting, ""There will never be a n----r at SAE.""

The tweet, directed at OU president David Boren, said ""Racism is alive at The University of Oklahoma.""

Students at the university planned to demonstrate on the Norman, Oklahoma, campus at 7:30 a.m. local time. A prayer vigil was held Sunday night.

The frat house was vandalized overnight, defaced with graffiti.

Chelsea Davis, one of two co-directors of Unheard, said the video was recorded during the weekend. Unheard was started at the beginning of the semester to demand change, especially relating to diversity issues, Davis said.

""Clearly in that video, that is nothing new. That is nothing that just sparks up overnight. That is a chant that was well-known, well-versed, and seemed to be OK with everybody that was involved,"" said Davis, a junior at the university.

Boren responded on Twitter, saying, ""If the video is indeed of OU students, this behavior will not be tolerated and is contrary to all of our values.""

If the video is indeed of OU students, this behavior will not be tolerated and is contrary to all of our values. We are investigating. - DBo

Brad Cohen, the national president of Sigma Alpha Epsilon, said the chapter ""has immediately been placed on a cease and desist.""

@Melyssious The chapter has immediately been placed on a cease & desist. No place for racism. They will be dealt with!

In a statement, the national SAE organization said it closed the Oklahoma Kappa chapter at the University of Oklahoma and suspended all of the fraternity's members -- and the members involved with the incident could have their membership privileges revoked permanently.

""We apologize for the unacceptable and racist behavior of the individuals in the video, and we are disgusted that any member would act in such a way. Furthermore, we are embarrassed by this video and offer our empathy not only to anyone outside the organization who is offended but also to our brothers who come from a wide range of backgrounds, cultures and ethnicities,"" Sigma Alpha Epsilon wrote in an online statement.

1x8eYrQ,2015-03-19 00:00:00,"'The Sound of Music' That Never Was: What Musical Creators, Filmmakers Changed - ABC News",http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/sound-music-musical-creators-filmmakers-changed/story?id=29613746,"“The Sound of Music” has remained one of the most iconic films in history since it was released 50 years ago.

It’s this Rodgers and Hammerstein classic that brought us songs like “Do Re Mi” and “My Favorite Things,” and told the story of a nun named Maria who dreamed of a different life, and became a part of the singing von Trapp family, all of which are ingrained in American culture.

But there are a few scenes from the 1965 film that were never shown, titles that were changed, and lyrics Oscar Hammerstein struggled with, which could have made the film completely different than the version we know and love today.

Here are a few things the musical creators, and then later filmmakers, changed about “The Sound of Music.”

1. The Title Was Originally Called 'Love Song'

In a telegram dated Feb. 6, 1959, lawyers for the original play pleaded with Rodgers and Hammerstein to ""PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE get a new title!"" for ""their forthcoming musical play"" because of copyright issues over the name, ""Love Song.""

""Over 300 musical compositions have already been copyrighted under that name,"" the telegram reads.

So the name was changed to ""The Sound of Music.""

2. 'My Favorite Things' Originally Had a Different Title and Lyrics

When Hammerstein was writing the song, ""My Favorite Things,"" he started off by literally writing down a list of some of his favorite things.

On one of Hammerstein early notes about the song, he wrote, “Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens, curling my fingers in warm woolen mittens, riding down a hill on my big brother’s bike, these are a few of the things that I like.”

Next to “curling” is the handwritten word “kettle,” and next to ""like"" is the handwritten phrase, ""my favorite things."" Today, we know the lyrics as “Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens, bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens, silver white winters that melt into spring, these are a few of my favorite things.”

The name of the song was also originally called “Good Things,” and Hammerstein crossed it out and changed it to “My Favorite Things.”

3. 'Do Re Mi' Was Originally Titled 'First Singing Lesson'

But was also later changed.

In the original play, ""Do Re Mi"" was the first song Maria sang to the von Trapp children, but for the movie, filmmakers made “My Favorite Things” the first song she sang with them instead. Originally, “My Favorite Things” was sang as a duet between Maria and the Mother Abbess.

4. Oscar Hammerstein Struggled With a Lyric for 'Sol'

When writing the song, “Do Re Mi,” Hammerstein wrote lyrics for each beat such as, “Do, a deer, a female deer, Re, a drop of golden sun,” but he struggled to come up with a lyric for the beat, “Sol,” which is pronounced “So,” but written both ways in his notes.

“So is a thing you do with grain, oat wheat,” reads one of Hammerstein’s handwritten notes about the song, as he tried out different lyrics.

It took him four days to come up with the lyric as we know it today: “So, a needle pulling thread.”

5. The 'Do Re Mi' Scene Was Supposed to Include a Maze

When performing “Do Re Mi” in the movie, Maria and the von Trapp children were supposed to be seen running and singing through a garden maze on the house grounds. Filmmakers even drew up storyboards of what the scene would look like, and every single beat of music in the song was timed exactly for the actors.

But in the end, the scene was scrapped.

6. There Was Supposed to Be a Scene with Maria, Rolf and Liesl

According to Burt Fink, the Rodgers and Hammerstein company’s senior vice president for Europe, there was a scene shot for the movie with Maria, Rolf and Liesl together, but it was cut for time.

In the film’s current version, Maria never meets Rolf.

Apple will live stream its ""Spring Forward"" event from the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts on Monday at 1 p.m. ET.

The flagship wearable device is set to ship in April, however Apple hasn't yet revealed an exact release date.

Since Tim Cook showed off the watch last September, Apple has been dropping tantalizing teases about its first wearable. The watch even landed its first magazine cover, gracing the wrist of a model on the front of November's issue of Vogue China.

While there are plenty of questions that will likely be answered on Monday, there is plenty we do know about the Apple Watch.

The wearable comes equipped with Apple Pay and a rich ecosystem of apps that can help keep the wearer informed with nuggets of information throughout the day, such as a dinner date or a flight delay.

It's also compatible with the iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 5, iPhone 5C and iPhone 5S. It is expected to begin at a price point of $349 and will come in three editions: Apple Watch Sport, the standard Apple Watch and a luxury gold edition. Consumers can expect to pay more for the high-end versions.

While other wearables focus on a touch screen, Apple is making navigation on the watch head easier by letting users move the digital crown to toggle between apps.

The wrist is ""a very interesting place"" because users can glance at it while ""you can't glance at a lot of other places on your body,"" Cook told ABC News' David Muir in an exclusive interview after the watch was announced last year.

""You can measure a lot of things from there and you can just get, honestly, a tidbit today of what all it can do,"" Cook said. ""But I think it's huge.""

The watch is expected to surpass the bestselling Pebble wearable -- but competitors shouldn't lament Apple's entry into the market.

""The Apple Watch is good news for the entire wearables segment because it will take consumer awareness to a whole new level,"" Ben Wood, chief of research at CCS Insight, a technology analysis firm, told ABC News last month.

""If you don't own an iPhone but you are keen to join the smart watch party, there are alternatives,"" he added."

Rose, 73, played from 1963 to 1986, amassing 4,256 hits, still a major league record. Three years after he retired, Rose agreed to a permanent ban from baseball amid accusations he gambled on games while playing and managing for the Cincinnati Reds.

Gaining reinstatement from the commissioner could be the first step to Rose reaching the Hall of Fame. In 1991, the Hall voted to ban players on the permanently ineligible list from induction.

Manfred, who is a member of the Hall of Fame board, said he has had no discussions with the museum about its plans regarding Rose.

""Honestly, I don't think people should read any disposition into what I'm saying about this. I see it as a really simple thing. He's made a request,"" Manfred said. ""Part of my obligations under the major league constitution is to deal with those requests, and I'll deal with it.""

Manfred took over from Selig in January after serving under him as MLB's chief operating officer and longtime negotiator in collective bargaining. Selig was a staunch opponent of allowing Rose back into the game.

Manfred, who has been making the rounds of major league spring training camps in Florida and Arizona, said the subject of Rose's standing has been among the more frequent questions he has fielded from players. Manfred addressed the Dodgers players and coaches briefly Monday morning.

Dodgers manager Don Mattingly said he thinks there will come a time ""when we all kind of move on."" Mattingly said he first met Rose in a spring training game when Rose was playing for the Montreal Expos.

""I got a hit off somebody, and he said, '200 a year, kid. Just get 200 a year.' Any time I see him, I love seeing him,"" Mattingly said. ""Obviously, as a kid, I loved Pete and the way he played. I'm not going to get into all the politics and everything that goes along with that, but I love Pete and I think Pete's a great player."""
1x91hTU,2015-03-09 00:00:00,Madison Police Shooting: What We Know About Officer Matt Kenny's 2007 Incident - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/US/madison-police-shooting-officer-matt-kennys-2007-incident/story?id=29500349,"The police officer who shot and killed an unarmed teenager in Madison, Wisconsin, had previously been involved in a fatal shooting, authorities said.

News reports from the time detail how Officer Matt Kenny was not only exonerated from wrongdoing in the 2007 shooting and received the medal of valor the following year for that incident.

Kenny, a 12-year veteran of the Madison Police Department, is now on paid administrative leave as the investigation into the Friday shooting death of 19-year-old Tony Robinson continues.

The first time Kenny fatally shot someone while on the force came in June 2007 when he and two other officers responded to a 911 call from a man named Ronald Brandon who said that a man was waving a gun around, according to the Wisconsin State Journal.

When Brandon, 48, who had been drinking, called 911 to report the man, he failed to mention that he was the person in question or that the gun he was holding was an unloaded pellet gun, police said at the time.

The Wisconsin State Journal reported that Brandon's ex-wife called police at the same time and told the dispatcher that the gun Brandon was waving was an unloaded pellet gun. That information, however, was not relayed to officers in time.

A later report by the newspaper concluded that the ex-wife first mentioned the pellet gun to the dispatcher less than two minutes before Brandon was shot in the head by Kenny, who had not received the message in time.

A search warrant cited by The Capital Times of Madison stated that Kenny told Brandon to drop the gun, but Brandon refused and then pointed his weapon at the officers.

Kenny was the one who fired two shots at Brandon from his rifle -- but all three responding officers were exonerated of wrongdoing, authorities said.

""Officer Kenny was presented with a life and death choice that required him to match the direct threat of lethal force with lethal force,"" District Attorney Brian Blanchard wrote in a letter obtained by the Wisconsin State Journal that was sent to Madison Police Chief Noble Wray in 2007 during the investigation.

ABC News' request for the police records in the 2007 case are being processed by the Madison Police Department but were not immediately available given the ongoing investigation into Friday's shooting.

When Kenny received the Madison Police Department's Medal of Valor in May 2008, investigators had concluded that the incident was a ""suicide by cop,"" the Wisconsin State Journal reported.

Kenny's actions are back under investigation after he went into an apartment during a search for a suspect who had been yelling and jumping in front of cars, according to 911 calls. The suspect, Robinson, was shot by Kenny inside, according to police. Kenny reportedly sustained undisclosed injuries.

""He' a decorated officer not only for an officer-involved shooting that occurred in 2007 but he also received a life-saving award in 2005,"" Jim Palmer, executive director of the Wisconsin Professional Police Association, told ABC News Saturday.

Kenny will not be speaking out while the investigation is ongoing. Kenny has been placed on paid administrative leave."

“I don’t play the lottery at all, but my father is a retired hospital administrator-turned-avid Lottery player,” Joseph Amorese of Easton, Pennsylvania, said, according to the New York Lottery.

Amorese's father sent the $7 Million Golden Ticket scratch card inside a greeting card, while Amorese recovered at home from surgery.

“I scratched the ticket and it was a good thing I was already sitting down because I was shocked. I was and still am in complete disbelief,” Amorese, 46, said.

The Verizon employee said he immediately called his dad, who lives in Congers, New York, to double-check the winnings.

“I sent him a picture of the ticket and he said, ‘Yup, you won $7,000,000!’”

He also called his wife, Jodi, a social worker.

“I said, Honey, I think we won $7,000,000. And there was silence on the other end for a long time. She was too stunned to talk.”

The ticket was purchased at Just a Dollar in New City, New York.

Amorese's father declined to tell ABC News if his son will reward him.

“I just wish him the very, very best, and I’m happy for him,” he said.

When asked if he typically sends his son greeting cards, he said, “Well sure, you know, for Easter, Christmas and birthdays.”

“Do I usually include a ticket? Yeah,” Amorese's father said with a laugh. “I’m retired and I have time on my hands. You know, you want them to get something but if they get $100, they’ll be happy. Most of us don’t usually think you’re going to hit the jackpot."""
1xa5E0J,2015-03-10 00:00:00,Olympic Champion Camille Muffat Among French Athletes Killed in Helicopter Tragedy - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/International/olympic-champion-camille-muffat-french-athletes-killed-helicopter/story?id=29521015,"Camille Muffat made it look so easy.

The French swimmer won the gold medal at the 2012 Olympics, setting an Olympic record in the 400-meter freestyle.

The medal-winning run was marked by power and efficiency and grace, her limbs slicing through the water with machine-like might. When the race was complete, Muffat stuck out her tongue and hugged her teammate, a defining accomplishment for the then-22-year-old.

The Olympic highlight drew renewed attention Monday after news emerged that Muffat, 25, and seven others perished when their helicopters collided while filming a  reality-TV show in northwest Argentina. Other victims included Olympic boxer Alexis Vastine and champion sailor Florence Arthaud.

The sports figures were part of a team filming the reality show ""Dropped,"" a survivalist program with several versions across Europe. News of the deaths sent the French sports world into mourning.

""The brutal demise of our compatriots is an immense sadness,"" French President Francois Hollande said in a statement.

Muffat’s addition to the TV program was announced about two weeks ago. She had participated in various events and causes since retiring from swimming last year, a retirement she partially attributed to a dispute with her coach.

“I have taken a big decision to stop swimming,” she said in 2014, according to the French newspaper L’Equipe, translated by Agence France-Presse. “[The disagreement with coach Fabrice Pellerin] will stay between us like many other things, good or bad, but I mention that because that was what started things off.”

The helicopters crashed while flying near Villa Castelli in La Rioja province, about 730 miles northwest of Buenos Aires, La Rioja Secretary of Security Cesar Angulo told television station TN. ""An explosion occurred and it's believed that they collided,"" Angulo said.

Photographs showed the burning and smoking wreckage of the helicopters on the ground in dry scrubland with people gathered nearby.

The crew had arrived Sunday in Villa Castelli, where it had previously filmed a version of the show for Switzerland and Denmark, Villa Castelli Mayor Andres Navarrete said.

Both Argentine pilots, identified as Juan Carlos Castillo and Roberto Abate, died in the crash.

""The causes of the crash are not known,"" Navarrete told radio station Cadena 3.

Following the crash, the show's broadcaster TF1 released a statement.

""We have learned, with great sadness, the accident on the set of the show 'Dropped,'"" the statement reads. ""[Chief Executive Officer] Nonce Paolini and all TF1 teams come together in this terrible time of pain for the families and relatives of the victims.""

Vastine, 28, won a boxing bronze medal at the 2008 games in Beijing in the 60-64 kilogram category, but his semifinal loss to Manuel Felix Diaz was marred in controversy as he was docked points by the referee in the final round. Vastine broke down in tears after the defeat.

Arthaud, 57, won the 1990 Route du Rhum, a prestigious yacht race between Brittany and the Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe, a triumph in the male-dominated sport. Her athletic successes followed a serious car accident at age 17 that left her in a coma.

The death of Muffat was felt in the United State: Many U.S. swimmers had raced against her. As initial reports of the tragedy emerged online, swimmers reflected on Twitter, honoring a fallen competitor.

Shocked and saddened to hear of Camille Muffat's passing. An incredible athlete and an inspiration to us all. #RIP

Rest in peace, Camille Muffat

Fellow swimmers Monday reflected on Muffat’s presence.

""Camille was quite a shy and reserved person. She was discreet. But when it was time for a bit of a laugh she was always there,"" Olympic gold medalist Amaury Leveaux said. ""French sport has lost a great champion.""

1xaoqVR,2015-03-09 00:00:00,Indianapolis VA Hospital Under Fire for Email Making Fun of Veterans - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/US/indianapolis-va-hospital-fire-email-making-fun-veterans/story?id=29513903,"The Department of Veterans Affairs took another hit today as news surfaced that an email had been circulated to staffers at an Indianapolis VA hospital making fun of the mental health problems suffered by returning combat veterans.

The Dec. 18 message included several images of a toy Christmas elf, according to The Indianapolis Star, which obtained the email.

The email was sent by social worker Robin Paul to her staff within the Seamless Transition Integrated Care Clinic at the Roudebush VA Medical Center.

In one photograph, the elf pleads for Xanax, which is prescribed to treat anxiety and panic. The caption reads: ""Self-medicating for mental health issues."" In another image, the elf hangs by a Christmas light with the message: ""Caught in the act of suicidal behavior (trying to hang himself from an electrical cord).""

The news comes at a time when suicide among military veterans claims an estimated 22 lives a day, according to the Department of Veterans Affairs.

Critics called today's news just another black mark on an agency mired in scandal. In May 2014, VA Secretary Eric Shinseki resigned amid accusations that the department had hid unacceptably long wait times for patient care. In February, his replacement apologized after falsely claiming that he'd served in Special Forces.

""All we want for the VA to do is to be able to fix what's broken, to hold employees accountable and help restore the faith of veterans in their VA health care system,"" said Joe Davis, director of public affairs for the Veterans of Foreign Wars. ""This one employee, this one supervisor, violated all three of those. ... It was [an] extremely poor attempt at humor.""

In a statement released by a facility spokeswoman, Paul , the social worker who sent the email, said: ""I would like to sincerely apologize for the email message and I take full responsibility for this poor judgment. ... I hold all Veterans and military personnel in the highest regard and am deeply remorseful for any hurt this may have caused.""

In an emailed statement, the hospital called Paul's email ""totally inappropriate.""

""The Indianapolis VA Medical is committed to treating our Veterans and the health conditions they face with the utmost respect and compassion,"" the hospital said. ""We apologize to our Veterans and take suicide and mental health treatment seriously, striving to provide the highest quality.""

The VA would not say whether Paul had been fired, only that the matter had been handled."

Smiley was born without eyes, but is still able to work as a St. John’s Ambulance service dog in Ontario. The dog’s owner, Joanne George, rescued the dog from a puppy mill, when he was about 1 or 2 years old.

“He was very scared, [the dogs] had never been out of that barn,” George recalled, adding that Smiley quickly bonded with another one of his dogs, a deaf Great Dane named Tyler.

“Tyler was so bouncy and crazy and happy go lucky and [Smiley] turned into the same dog,” George said. “He came out from underneath the tables where he was always hiding.”

George said seeing Smiley interact with crowds made her realize he would be a perfect therapy dog. She now brings the dogs to hospitals and schools in the area and says the dog almost always brightens people’s days.

She said at one nursing home, she realized how even a small visit with Smiley could make people happy.

“There was this man Teddy, [he had] no speech, no communication at all,” George said of one memorable nursing home resident. “[The staff] had never seen Teddy smile before.”

But once Smiley came up to Teddy, George said the staff was amazed. “[Teddy] smiled when Smiley got into his vision,” George said

George said after caring for Smiley for 10 years, she has learned a lot about how to care for blind dogs.

“Somebody through St. John’s Ambulance is wanting to adopt a dog that’s blind,” George said. “I told her all those things don’ t be his eyes, don’t run his life, don’t’ keep him in a bubble.”

She said it's key for Smiley to figure out how to get around on his own. George said Smiley is mostly able to get around on his own without too much difficulty.

""Does he bump into things? Of course, he does. But he does it very carefully,"" George said, noting the dog’s ""high"" steps when he walks. ""He’s feeling with his feet."""

Brody and Susan Pettit, the parents of Levi Pettit, released a statement Tuesday saying they were ""shocked and saddened"" by what they saw in the video.

""As parents of Levi, we love him and care for him deeply,"" they said. ""He made a horrible mistake, and will live with the consequences forever. However, we also know the depth of our son's character. He is a good boy, but what we saw in those videos is disgusting.

""While it may be difficult for those who only know Levi from the video to understand, we know his heart, and he is not a racist,"" they said. ""We raised him to be loving and inclusive and we all remain surrounded by a diverse, close-knit group of friends.""

Levi Pettit is the second of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon members seen in the video to be identified.

The president of Jesuit College Preparatory School of Dallas said the fraternity member apparently ""leading"" the racist chant on a bus full of students is a recent graduate of the high school.

""In the recent video regarding OU and the SAE [Sigma Alpha Epsilon] fraternity, it appears that a graduate from Jesuit Dallas is leading the racist chant,"" according to a statement by Mike Earsing, the president of Jesuit Dallas, which has confirmed its former student's name as Parker Rice, 19.

""I am appalled by the actions in the video and extremely hurt by the pain this has caused our community. It is unconscionable and very sad that in 2015 we still live in a society where this type of bigotry and racism takes place.""

Earsing added, ""Unfortunately, isolated incidents throughout our society remind us that there is still much work to be done.""

ABC News has been unable to reach Rice. The Jesuit Dallas Alumni Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

University of Oklahoma student Matthew Lopez, who lived on the same residence hall floor as Rice in Norman, Oklahoma, said ""he's a person of high moral fiber,"" and, ""someone that's tolerant of other people and their different cultures and their different backgrounds.

""I know Parker,"" Lopez told ABC News. ""He's not a racist.""

The University of Oklahoma, citing privacy laws, declined to name two students it expelled in connection to the now-viral video. So it was unclear whether Rice or Pettit were among the two expelled students.

University of Oklahoma President David Boren said the students who played a leadership role in the ""exclusionary"" chant had created a hostile learning environment. He said the chant was heard not only by those on a bus, but also affected the entire university community because it was distributed through social media.

Boren said, ""I have emphasized that there is zero tolerance for this kind of threatening racist behavior at the University of Oklahoma. I hope that the entire nation will join us in having zero tolerance of such racism when it raises its ugly head in other situations across our country.""

He continued, ""I am extremely proud of the reaction and response expressed by our entire university family -- students, faculty, staff, and alumni about this incident. They are 'Real Sooners' who believe in mutual respect for all. I hope that students involved in this incident will learn from this experience and realize that it is wrong to use words to hurt, threaten and exclude other people. We will continue our investigation of all the students engaged in the singing of this chant. Once their identities have been confirmed, they will be subject to appropriate disciplinary action.""

According to Boren's letter, if the expelled students disagree with the decision, they can contact the school's Equal Opportunity Office by this Friday.

The president of the university's Black Student Association, Isaac Hill, a 20-year-old engineering major, said he agreed with the president's decision to expel two of the students involved because ""those people don't deserve to carry the title that comes with being a student here."""

Oh, and a penchant for the written word.

Running a quaint New England Inn is the dream of many. But often, quaint comes with a steep price. Here's a chance to win an inn -- the Center Lovell Inn in Maine, about three hours north of Boston -- estimated to be worth 900k.

And all you have to do is write a short essay and with your submission, a $125 check.

The current innkeeper, Janice Sage, herself won the inn in an essay contest 22 years ago, according to The Boston Globe. But after 17-hour days, $500,000 in renovations and serving up to 120 dinners a night in the inn's restaurant, Sage is ready to move on.

The inn reportedly comes with all the furnishings, but no food or alcohol. And the person who wins the contest must agree to ""maintain the property as a country inn and restaurant for at least one year after the hand-over, keep the building painted white, and maintain the roofing and shutters in forest green, hunter green, or black.""

Sage expects about 7,500 entries. That would come to almost $940,000 for Sage to enjoy her retirement.

She will read all the entries on the subject: ""Why I would like to own and operate a country inn,"" by May 17, the Globe reported.

She'll choose her top 20 and then hand those over to two unnamed area judges who will pick the winner. The transfer is expected to be complete within 30 days."

Mike Pence today declared a public health emergency for a county battling what is believed to be the worst HIV outbreak in the state's history.

Pence said 79 cases have been confirmed, and, with more testing underway, ""We expect that number to go up.""

The cases have either been found in or are connected to Scott County, near the Kentucky border.

Every single confirmed case has been related to intravenous drug use of the opioid painkiller Opana, said Pence.

It's believed to be the worst HIV outbreak in the state history, said Brittany Combs, public health nurse at Scott County Health Department.

Pence, who has long opposed needle-exchange programs, said he would authorize a limited needle-exchange program in the county if local health officials decide that could combat further infections.

""This is all-hands-on-deck. This is a very serious situation,"" said Pence, who added that officials from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advised that a needle-exchange program should be set up.

""I'm prepared to make an exception to my long-standing opposition to needle-exchange programs,"" said Pence. ""This is a public health emergency driven by intravenous drug use.""

By declaring a public health disaster, Pence said that he was ordering relevant agencies to assist the state and county health department to fight the spread of HIV.

""For years, we've been fighting Opana in our county,"" Combs said. ""[Doctors] won't give [prescriptions] for Opana unless absolutely necessary. Our doctors aren't writing for it. It's coming from out of county.""

Combs said Opana is a painkiller normally given in pill form to patients, and it is used as ""last resort"" for pain relief. People recreationally using the drug often crush the pill and inject it for a longer-lasting high, according to Combs.

Everyone who has tested positive for HIV has admitted to intravenous drug use, although some have also had sex with other users, meaning it is not always clear how the virus was spread, according to Combs.

Pence noted Wednesday that the county usually sees just five cases a year, according to The Associated Press.

""This is a public health emergency, and I'm listening to my health department, I'm listening to the Centers for Disease Control and I'll make my decision based on the best science and the best way we can stop this virus and stop this outbreak in its tracks,"" Pence told the AP Wednesday.

A public awareness campaign to alert residents about the increase in HIV cases has started in the region.

Bill Moore was 20 years old in 1944 when he wrote a letter to a young woman named Bernadean that he met while on furlough during the war, not knowing that he would go on to marry her.

The letter was found in the sleeve of a record that was purchased by a stranger in a thrift shop. The stranger went on a search to reunite the letter with its author.

Moore, now 90, now lives in an assisted care facility in Aurora, Colorado. His daughter was contacted shortly before Valentine's Day this year by the person who unintentionally bought the letter, and Moore was overcome with emotion when he read it for the first time in 70 years.

""I was really surprised because I would have no way of knowing that it would show up in the way it did,"" he told ABC News' Denver affiliate, KMGH.

Moore was fighting in Patton's Third Army at the time and what he didn't know when he wrote that letter was that he would go on to marry the woman he called ""my darling, lovable, alluring, Bernadean"" and have three children together.

They were married for 63 years before she died in 2010.

""I loved her ... she loved me and that's all I can tell you is the heartache of not being with her all the time,"" he told KMGH."

A Los Angeles jury Tuesday awarded the musician’s relatives more than $7.3 million in damages -- a cut of the profits from the 2013 smash hit “Blurred Lines,” which was found to have copied parts of Gaye’s 1977 hit “Got to Give it Up.”

The decision capped a lengthy legal battle between Gaye’s family and the creators of “Blurred Lines,” Pharrell Williams, Robin Thicke and Clifford Harris, the rapper known as T.I. Under the ruling, Williams will pay about $1.6 million and Thicke will pay about $1.77 million. The jury ruled Harris -- who received a co-songwriting credit for “Blurred Lines” -- did not infringe on the Gaye copyright.

“We want to put together a tribute show, and maybe Pharrell will want to show up and participate,” she said, speaking inside the same studio where her former husband recorded his classic song.

Gaye’s family was present through the 10-day trial, which centered around the two songs’ similarities. Both Williams and Thicke testified that while the songs are similar in feel, “Blurred Lines” didn’t copy Gaye’s work outright. Thicke even performed an impromptu medley of hits in the courtroom to show how pop songs can share melodies without being rip-offs.

The “Blurred Lines” performers were not in court Tuesday. They later released a joint statement from Thicke’s representatives: ""While we respect the judicial process, we are extremely disappointed in the ruling made today, which sets a horrible precedent for music and creativity going forward. 'Blurred Lines' was created from the heart and minds of Pharrell, Robin and T.I. and not taken from anyone or anywhere else. We are reviewing the decision, considering our options and you will hear more from us soon about this matter.""

One of the lawyers for the Gaye family, Richard Busch, said the case was not about songwriting inspiration, it was about copying.

“It speaks volumes about who we are as a country that, no matter who you are, if you do something wrong there are consequences,” Busch said.

Gaye, who rose to fame on the Motown Records label during the 1960s, showcased his musicality and social awareness with the concept albums “What’s Going On” and “Let’s Get It On,” and continued evolving as a musician until his death in 1984.

The dispute over “Blurred Lines” began in 2013, when Thicke, Williams and Harris initially filed a lawsuit against the Gaye family to defend themselves against a public accusation that they stole parts of ""Got to Give It Up."" Later that year, the Gaye family counter-sued. Then, in 2014, a judge sided with Gaye's loved ones, ruling that their musicological experts provided sufficient evidence for the case to go to trial.

After the verdict was reached, Gaye’s family was openly emotional outside the courthouse.

“The jury up there, they didn’t have to go our way,” said Nona Gaye, the singer’s daughter. “They copied ‘Got to Give it Up’ and [the jury] heard it! Which was very important. They heard it, you know. It wasn’t just us.”

Jan Gaye was thankful about the trial’s outcome.

“It’s gratifying, I just felt filled,” she said."

But what if some of those protected witnesses are also sexual predators? And are their new communities informed?

The short answer: not usually. There are now at least four sex offenders in the program who have received a new name and a new home, “but the Department of Justice did not use adequate safeguards to protect and notify the public and law enforcement about the risk posed,” according to a new DOJ Inspector General report released today.

The crimes of some of those protected by the program include rape and sexual assault of children.

“We believe that the DOJ generally did not use adequate safeguards to protect and notify the public and law enforcement about the risk posed by sex offender participants in the Program.” the report states.

When the IG audit of Witness Protection began in July 2013, the report found, the Department of Justice didn’t even know how many sex offenders were in Witness Protection. Last year, DOJ identified 58 sex offenders who were in the program at some point.

Ten of those offenders were convicted of sexual offenses before they entered the program. Ten committed their crimes while in the program, and 38 were convicted of sex offenses when they were no longer in the program.

Since the audit began, the IG says, the Justice Department has taken steps to improve oversight of sex offenders in the program and those who’ve been released.

This is the IG’s second report in two years criticizing the Witness Protection Program. In 2013, the IG found “inadequate monitoring of known or suspected terrorists” who were in Witness Protection, and “a failure to share essential information about WITSEC Program participants with the Terrorist Screening Center and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.”

The DOJ won’t say how many people are in its program currently for security reasons, but since its inception in the early-1970s, there have been 8,648 witnesses under protection, mostly by the U.S. Marshals Service.

Audio from inside the cockpit indicates co-pilot Andreas Lubitz, a 27-year-old German citizen, was in control of the Airbus A320. That's according to Brice Robin, public prosecutor of Marseille, who spoke at a news conference Thursday.

""The intention was to destroy the plane,"" Robin said.

Here's a breakdown of what we know about Flight 9525's last moments, based on information released by authorities:

At 10:30 a.m., the plane is flying at 38,000 feet.

At some point around this time, the pilot is heard asking the co-pilot to take over the controls. A chair is heard moving and a door is heard closing.

At 10:31 a.m., the plane starts losing altitude.

The co-pilot is alone at the controls, and the accelerated descent is made manually. The pilot is heard knocking on the door and asking over the speaker to enter the cockpit. There is no response from the co-pilot.

The plane’s altitude drops down to roughly 6,000 feet.

Air traffic control can be heard calling, but there is no response. The pilot is heard “violently” banging on the door, as he tries to get back into the cockpit, according to Robin. The co-pilot is heard breathing until the final moment of impact, leading officials to believe he was alive until the crash.

At 10:40 a.m., the plane crashes, and the radar contact is lost.

Editor’s note: A French prosecutor initially said Lubitz was 28 years old but a law enforcement official later determined that he was 27."

The 25-year-old was working a double shift for her job at local burger joint, Mac's Grub Shak, when something amazing happened.

""It was actually a really slow day and then this couple came in,"" said Hudson of Spring Hill, Tennessee. ""I didn’t even realize the tip until after they were gone.""

The unidentified diners had left a $36 tip on a bill that couldn't have been more than $30, Hudson told ABC News.

""I would’ve liked to have caught them and said 'hey this is awesome!,' she said. ""They did it anonymously and it was really sweet.""

In addition to the $36, the couple also left Hudson with a note explaining the heartfelt meaning behind the digits.

""Today is my brother's b-day,"" it said, written behind the credit card receipt. ""He would have been 36 today. Every year I go eat his favorite meal (hot dogs) and tip the waitress his age. Happy B-day Wes.""

""I was in tears when I read it,"" Hudson said. ""I had to go in the back of the restaurant and compose myself before I went out to my other tables.""

About three hours after the experience, Hudson posted an image of her customer's note on Reddit.

""When I woke up I was on the front page,"" she said. ""It had over 1.5 million views on Imgur and 350K upvotes on Reddit.""

In light of her story going viral, Hudson and the restaurant owner hope to track down the kind patron that left the tip.

""We want to see what his brother Wes liked on his hot dogs because we'd like to name a hot dog after him,"" she said.

""I have a friend, he was my best friend, he died about three years ago. This experience has definitely given me the idea to do the same thing on his birthday every year. It was deeply moving and just the coolest thing that’s ever happened."""

People in the Faroe Islands, which are located in the North Atlantic, halfway between Iceland and Norway, had front-row seats to the eclipse, which occurred early Friday as the new moon completely covered the sun.

This is the world's first total solar eclipse since November 2013. A partial solar eclipse was also visible in most of Europe.

The United States will have its turn to enjoy a total solar eclipse when it passes over the country on Aug. 21, 2017, according to NASA.

The moon will also reach perigee on Friday, the point where it is closest to the Earth, creating a supermoon -- albeit a dark one -- that will add another element to the total solar eclipse.

Get ready for spring if you live in the northern hemisphere.

The official start of spring, the vernal equinox, will be marked on Friday at 6:45 p.m. ET when the Earth's axis lines up perpendicularly to the sun's rays -- marking one of the two equinoxes that occur each year."

The ad is part of the CDC's “Tips” campaign, which has become known for using real smokers to show the grotesque effects of smoking. It marks the first time one of the ads will feature a person who cites e-cigarettes.

The print and radio ad features a 35-year-old Tennessee woman named Kristy who took up e-cigarettes to help her quit smoking regular cigarettes and to get rid of her ""smoker's cough.""

After starting e-cigarettes, Kristy didn't give up smoking tobacco cigarettes and said she eventually went back to smoking regular cigarettes. Months after using e-cigarettes, she ended up in the hospital with a collapsed lung and signs of early COPD, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder.

At that point, according to the ad, Kristy was able to finally give up tobacco. In the ad, Kristy said she hopes her story inspires others to stop smoking before it’s too late.

""I can actually breathe,"" she said. ""I can play with my kids. When I smoked, I had no energy. It just affected my whole life.""

Advocates for e-cigarettes and other vaping devices said the ad is misleading and that it mistakenly connects the tobacco products with the e-cigarette.

“It just continues the CDC’s several-year quest to mislead smokers into believing that vaper products [including e-cigarettes] may be hazardous to the health of smokers,” said Gregory Conley, the president of the American Vaping Association, which advocates for small- and medium-sized vaping-related companies. “The clear implication in the new CDC ad is that the use of vaper products somehow contributed to the disease suffered by the smoker in the ad. That's patently dishonest.”

A CDC spokeswoman said the ad is aimed at smokers between the ages of 18 to 54 and that the ad is designed to show that mixing e-cigarettes with tobacco products is ""not an effective way to safeguard your health.""

But CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden released a statement Thursday that said the ad campaign's real-life stories can inspire others to quit tobacco products.

“These former smokers are helping save tens of thousands of lives by sharing their powerful stories of how smoking has affected them,” he said.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced a proposal last year to regulate e-cigarettes that would require manufacturers to disclose product ingredients and put warning labels on devices."

More than 100 demonstrators gathered, along with media and police presence, but the tone was much different than a night before, when a large crowd gathered following the resignation of the St. Louis suburb's police chief. It was during that gathering that shots rang out and the two officers were injured.

The officers were released from the hospital Thursday morning after sustaining non-threatening injuries, the St. Louis County Police said in a Facebook post. St. Louis County Police and the Missouri State Highway Patrol have taken over security for the protests in Ferguson since the shooting.

The officers, who have not been identified, were ""lucky"" they weren't killed, St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said earlier Thursday. He said they heard ""hear three or four shots ring out"" before the officers were hurt, both of whom were seriously wounded from a shooter standing about 150 feet away.

""We are lucky by God's grace that we didn't lose two police officers,"" he said.

One officer, 41, was struck in the shoulder; the other, 32, in the face, Belmar said.

Belmar said the shots were fired from an undetermined location north or northwest of the Ferguson Police Department building.

The search for the suspect or suspects is the ""number one priority"" within the St. Louis County police department, according to Belmar.

President Obama called the shooting ""unacceptable.""

Violence against police is unacceptable. Our prayers are with the officers in MO. Path to justice is one all of us must travel together. –bo

U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, in a statement released this morning, said, ""This heinous assault on two brave law enforcement officers was inexcusable and repugnant. I condemn violence against any public safety officials in the strongest terms, and the Department of Justice will never accept any threats or violence directed at those who serve and protect our communities. ... Such senseless acts of violence threaten the very reforms that nonviolent protesters in Ferguson and around the country have been working towards for the past several months.""

Holder also said he wished the officers ""a full and speedy recovery.""

""We stand ready to offer any possible aid to an investigation into this incident, including the department's full range of investigative resources. And we will continue to stand unequivocally against all acts of violence against cops whenever and wherever they occur,"" he added.

Tensions simmered in the city on Wednesday night after the resignation of the city’s police chief, Tom Jackson. Hundreds of protesters gathered throughout the night, staring down police officers in riot gear.

A handful of people were arrested. Some people chanted, and other flare-ups were reported, unrest rekindled after a Justice Department report documented widespread racial bias in the city.

Jackson’s resignation makes him the sixth person who has been fired or forced to resign since the report was released March 4 detailing what it described as rampant racial bias in policing in the St. Louis suburb.

Lt. Col. Al Eickhoff will take over as the acting chief of police starting today as the city launches a national search for a new chief of police, the letter stated.

Jackson had initially come under fire in August for his department's handling of the shooting death of unarmed teenager Michael Brown.

Brown's parents released a statement today, calling the police shooting ""senseless.""

""We reject any kind of violence directed toward members of law enforcement. It cannot and will not be tolerated,"" the family said. ""We specifically denounce the actions of stand-alone agitators who unsuccessfully attempt to derail the otherwise peaceful and non-violent movement that has emerged throughout this nation to confront police brutality and to forward the cause of equality under the law for all. We must work together to bring peace to our communities. Our thoughts and prayers remain with the officers injured during this morning's shooting and their families.""

Clad in black, the players took the field arm-in-arm Thursday afternoon and stood silently for several minutes before speaking with the media.

""This is an instance in which we feel like we have the opportunity to step up and promote that change,"" said quarterback Trevor Knight. He was among those players and coaches who posted a statement saying the team had not practiced this week and asked that the university continue its investigation into the executive board of the fraternity.

""It turned our stomachs and our hearts,"" added linebacker Eric Striker. ""It really hurt all of us.""

The university closed the SAE house on campus and expelled two students after the video emerged earlier this week, which shows fraternity members chanting, “There will never be a n***** at SAE” and also referred to lynchings and keeping African-Americans out of the fraternity.

""These types of incidents occur nationwide every single year, and our hope is to shed light on this issue and promote meaningful change at a national level,"" read the statement posted to Knight's and several others' Twitter accounts.

""The chant was not invented by the two that led it, but was taught to underclassmen by people of higher authority,"" the statement continued. ""Being a student at the University of Oklahoma is a privilege, and allowing this culture to thrive is against everything it means to be a Sooner. Ignorance is no excuse.""

Head coach Bob Stoops echoed his support for his players.

""This kind of stance is more important than practice,"" said Stoops. ""They want to affect change around the country, not just here.""

The university also issued a statement today, saying President David Boren planned to meet with the captains of the football team following spring break. He also asked the vice president of student affairs to investigate each officer of the fraternity to ""determine their responsibility and to make recommendations on appropriate disciplinary action.""

The Metro-North crash, which left six people dead and more than a dozen others were hospitalized with injuries, is under investigation -- but a timeline of the accident has started to emerge.

Here is what happened:

5:44 p.m. Tuesday, Feb. 3

A Metro-North Railroad train departs from Grand Central Station on the Harlem line, which cuts through the center of Westchester County.

About 700 passengers were believed to be on board.

6:33 p.m.

The crash occurred about 45 minutes into the journey, near the town of Valhalla, New York, which is 20 miles north of New York City.

The Metropolitan Transportation Authority confirmed the time of the crash as 6:33 p.m.

The crash came when the train slammed into a Jeep SUV that was on the tracks at the Commerce Street grade crossing.

The circumstances of the collision remain under investigation.

The SUV wrapped around the front of the train and was driven 400 feet down the track, dislodging the electrified third rail. The rail went through the SUV, punctured the gas tank causing an explosion, and then came through the floor of the train behind the motorman’s compartment.

""You had a metal rail going right down the train like a ramrod,"" Gov. Andrew Cuomo told ABC News Radio this morning. ""That’s what caused massive destruction.

""This was as ugly as anything I have ever seen,"" he said.

Passengers began evacuating the train, and the worst of the destruction appeared limited to the first train car.

""I saw flames coming at me, about a foot from my head,"" passenger Christopher Gross told ABC News this morning.

6:44 p.m.

Dr. Ivan Miller, the director of Westchester Medical Center, said at a news conference Wednesday that the hospital received the call 11 minutes after the crash and declared it a mass-casualty incident three minutes later, at 6:47 p.m. The declaration allowed the hospital to begin a protocol to prepare for a large number of trauma patients.

7:13 p.m.

Metro-North announced via Twitter that it was suspending all train service between North White Plains and Pleasantville, New York, as a result of the accident.

Three hours later, it announced that all northbound Harlem line trains out of Grand Central would stop at North White Plains.

7:20 p.m.

The first of 12 patients were brought to Westchester Medical Center for treatment, including five patients who were considered 'stage one' priorities given the extent of their injuries, Miller said.

""Initial word was that we might be receiving a lot more, so we were preparing to receive a lot more,"" Miller said.

10:12 p.m.

The National Transportation Safety Board announced that it would be sending a go-team of investigators from its Washington, D.C., headquarters to New York to survey the scene.

This Morning

MTA officials confirmed to ABC News that the driver of the train was expected to survive after being held overnight in the hospital.

Officials revised the number of announced fatalities down from seven to six -- five train passengers and the driver of the SUV, most of them said to be burned beyond recognition. There were 15 other passengers who are being treated for injuries.

Victims' families were meeting at the medical examiner's office this morning to attempt to make the final identifications.

11:00 a.m.

The head of the NTSB go-team held a news conference shortly after arriving on the scene but did not release any new information because it had not yet been able to confirm any information about the crash.

1:00 p.m.

Miller said that four of the patients who had been transported to Westchester Medical Center immediately after the accident were released from the hospital overnight and eight remained.

Chief nurse executive Patricia Wrobbel said that of the eight, one patient remained in critical condition, one in serious condition, four in fair condition and two in good condition."

Two Democrats familiar with the arrangement confirmed the deal to ABC News, which was first reported by Politico.

The site of the headquarters is 1 Pierrepont Plaza in the trendy neighborhood of Brooklyn Heights. According to its website, the 19-story building is marketed as “Modern offices. Brooklyn Cool.”

It is located conveniently by a number of popular restaurants and stores, including by Shake Shack, Chipotle, Starbucks and Urban Outfitters. (The building is also located where Clinton Street comes to an end.)

Federal Election Committee rules dictate that you have 15 days to form a committee after becoming a candidate, a distinction that involves crossing certain thresholds of campaign-related activity.

But, Clinton's team has not officially called this a ""campaign headquarters"" so for now it appears Clinton could be in the clear, campaign finance experts say.

Clinton’s spokesman has declined to comment on the new offices, but when asked earlier this week at an event in Brooklyn if she plans to return to the borough any time soon -- Clinton was quick to respond:

“All in good time,” she said, with a smile. “All in good time."""

“Four of the arrests were directly related to the attack, and five others were made under strong suspicion of relation to the attack,” the spokeswoman, Aida Klibi, said of the arrests made Wednesday.

She would not reveal further information on the identity of those arrested.

Meanwhile, searchers found three more people still hiding at the museum today, and authorities in the United States are stepping up security at some of this country's most popular museums, fearful of a follow-on or copy-cat attack.

In New York overnight, extra police were assigned to the city's most popular museums in a direct response to the attack at the museum in Tunisia.

""I'd call this a rather loud wake-up call for major museums around the world,"" said Peter Herdrich, vice chairman of The Antiquities Coalition, an archaeological advocacy group.

The attack in Tunisia came without warning, and security forces did not arrive in time to prevent the massacre.

Tourists inside the crowded museum in Tunisia's capital city ran for their lives, some shielding their children, as two gunmen approached. Later, they hid inside the galleries beneath priceless antiquities.

Two Spanish tourists and a guard were found still hiding today in the sarcophagus room, a museum official said.

A French tourist said police ordered museum visitors to run, run, run, adding that when they left the museum they saw dead bodies.

Officials this morning said at least 24 died, and 48 more were injured, including tourists from Poland, Germany, Spain and Italy, most of them massacred as they got off a tour bus that brought them to the museum from a cruise ship.

An eyewitness said one of the gunmen actually got on the tour bus and opened fire.

The parliament building next door to the museum was put on lockdown as defiant lawmakers sang the country's national anthem.

Tunisian Prime Minister Habib Essid said two gunmen were killed and police were searching for two or three more who may have been accomplices.

The museum attack came as terror groups call for attacks on soft targets and cultural centers.

""My concern would be that an individual who is becoming radicalized in their basement is watching a video on the Internet of an attack and decides that they want to replicate it,"" said John Cohen, a former counterterrorism official and an ABC News contributor.

Just last month, ISIS destroyed rooms full of centuries-old antiquities at a museum in Mosul, Iraq.

ISIS has made repeated threats against Tunisia, but authorities this morning said they believe another terror group was responsible -- but one that, like ISIS, has no hesitation to attack innocent Western tourists.

One of the two gunmen, Yassine Laabidi, was known to intelligence services but had no formal links to a particular terror group, Essid said on French radio today, according to The Associated Press.

1xiTkLQ,2015-03-13 00:00:00,"President Obama Reads Mean Tweets, Discusses Ferguson on 'Jimmy Kimmel Live' - ABC News",http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/president-obama-reads-tweets-discusses-ferguson-jimmy-kimmel/story?id=29604831,"President Obama read ""mean tweets,"" joked about Hillary Clinton's email address and discussed the unrest in Ferguson, Missouri, during a appearance Thursday on ""Jimmy Kimmel Live.""

For Mean Tweets -- a recurring segment that features celebrities reading online vitriol about themselves aloud -- Obama was a good sport, finding humor in the social media criticisms.

One tweet: “Is there any way we could fly Obama to some golf course halfway around the world and just leave him there?”

In a subsequent interview with Kimmel, Obama addressed the online opinions.

“Those weren’t that mean. You should see what the Senate says about me,” Obama said.

Obama and Kimmel discussed social media and mobile technology. The president admitted that he generally doesn’t tweet or send text messages. He can’t use smartphones that feature recording devices for security reasons, so he relies on a Blackberry.

And yes, he has Hillary Clinton’s email address.

“I can’t share it with you. ... I don’t think she’d want you to have it,” Obama told Kimmel.

Obama also addressed the situation in Ferguson, where two police officers were shot early Thursday amid protests. Both of the officers were later released from the hospital, but the shooting brings new focus and concern for the St. Louis suburb, which has been reeling since the August police shooting of unarmed black teen Michael Brown, as well as subsequent reports about the city’s governmental practices.

“What happened in Ferguson was oppressive and was worthy of protest, but it was no excuse for criminal acts. No one should be shot. [The shooters] are criminals and need to be arrested,” Obama said.

There were also some laughs with regard to marijuana legalization. When Obama sat down next to Kimmel, he noticed the host was up much higher than him.

“How come you’re so much higher than me?"" the president asked. ""It’s kind of a power play. But that’s OK. I’m glad you feel good about yourself.""

“Listen, if they legalize marijuana in Washington, D.C., you can be higher than me!” Kimmel fired back.

The president also jokingly provided some insight into what he does -- or doesn’t do -- in the White House. Cook? No. Drive? No (although he can drive). Go to the dentist? Nope. The dentist comes to him, of course. But, the president is allowed to go to the refrigerator and pick up his own silverware. In response to Kimmel's question about whether the president runs to the kitchen in his underpants, Obama said, “I mean, I could, but I don’t. I wouldn't wake somebody up to have a sandwich. There is a fridge and silverware.”

And then there were aliens. Kimmel said if he was elected, as unlikely as that might be, he would go through Area 51 files first thing.

“It’s at the top of my list,” he said.

“The aliens won’t let it happen,"" Obama said. ""You’d reveal all their secrets. They would exercise control over us.""

The president’s appearance closed with discussion of the Student Aid Bill of Rights, which Obama announced Tuesday at Georgia Tech. The Student Aid Bill of Rights would essentially make the process of repaying students loans easier and more manageable.

“The reason America ended up becoming the economic superpower it did is because we're the first to have universal public high schools, we had the GI bill so we had the best trained workforce, and young people understand that,"" Obama said. ""The problem is, it's also becoming more and more expensive, and what we've said is -- in addition to the work we've already done to make student loans cheaper, to expand Pell grants -- [let's] set up [a] repayment program so that young people who want to go into teaching or some other helping profession aren't priced out of it because they've got to pay student loans.”"
1xiZilz,2015-03-19 00:00:00,Martese Johnson: UVA Student's Bloody Arrest Triggers Campus Outrage - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/US/uva-students-bloody-arrest-triggers-campus-outrage/story?id=29749157,"Outrage is spreading across the University of Virginia grounds over the bloody arrest of a student after he attempted to enter a bar near the college, an incident that is now at the center of a police brutality investigation at the request of Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe.

The student, Martese Johnson, 20, participated in a rally Wednesday night with thousands of students in the university's amphitheater at the center of campus. He was seen wiping away tears and then taking the microphone himself at the emotionally charged gathering.

""I want the remainder of students out there to be able to share their opinions and share their feelings. I beg for you guys, regardless of your personal opinions and the way you feel about subjects, to please respect everyone here,"" Johnson said. ""We are all part of one community and we deserve to respect each other, especially in times like this. Thank you.""

President Teresa Sullivan did not address the group at the rally but did briefly speak to reporters about the incident that another school official had described as ""appalling.""

""My heart went out to him,"" Sullivan said. ""I thought about how I would feel if I were his mother.""

The state is investigating whether excessive force was used during Johnson's arrest early Wednesday morning by Alcoholic Beverage Control agents after he was denied entry at a University Avenue bar, officials have said.

The agents approached Johnson and “a determination was made” to arrest him, at which time “the arrested individual sustained injuries,” according to a statement by Alcoholic Beverage Control, which is charged with enforcing alcohol laws in Virginia.

Cellphone video shows Johnson lying face down on the sidewalk with two agents detaining him as bystanders yell, “His head is bleeding!” From another angle, Johnson, who is black, is shown with his face bloodied, shouting, “I go to UVA!” and then “You f****** racists!”

He was charged with public intoxication and obstruction of justice, Alcoholic Beverage Control officials said. They would not comment on the case beyond details of the arrest, adding, ""The individual received treatment for his injuries at a local hospital and was released.""

University Vice President for Diversity and Equity Marcus L. Martin and Dean of African-American Affairs Maurice Apprey described the incident in a message to students and staff as “appalling” and said the student’s head was “slammed into the hard pavement with excessive force.”

“This was wrong and should not have occurred,” Martin and Apprey wrote. “We view the nature of this assault as highly unusual and appalling based on the information we have received.""

The governor asked the state police to begin an independent investigation into the incident.

On Wednesday night, Johnson joined a large group of students gathered on campus at a rally.

Daniel Watkins, an attorney for Johnson, said in a statement that Charlottesville Police charged Johnson with two misdemeanors: obstruction of justice without force and profane swearing and/or intoxication in public. The student was released early Wednesday and did not immediately enter a plea to the charges.

""Just before handcuffing him, police took Martese to the ground, striking his head on the pavement and causing him to bleed profusely from the gash on his head,” Watkins said Wednesday. “This morning he received ten stitches at the University of Virginia Medical Center. Fortunately, Martese’s physical wounds are beginning to heal.”

He added: ""He holds numerous leadership positions on grounds, including Vice Chair for Community Relations of the Honor Committee, Vice Polemarch of the Eta Sigma Chapter of Kappa Alpha Psi, and a Chair of the Leadership Development Committee of the Black Student Alliance. He has no criminal record.""

Boston Police Commissioner William Evans called the shooting of Officer John Moynihan on Friday night ""unprovoked."" He and five other officers had pulled over a driver in Roxbury, Massachusetts, when the driver began firing at the officers, according to police.

The officers hadn't drawn their guns when the driver began shooting, said Evans. As the officers chased after him, the driver continued to fire, emptying his revolver as he ran.

The officers later shot the driver, who died on scene, police said. Evans identified him as Angelo West, 41, adding that he had a violent criminal past.

""No one had any indication of what might happen,"" said the police commissioner. ""He shot the officer point blank in the face.""

Moynihan, 34, was shot under his eye and the bullet became lodged behind his ear, Evans said.

A woman who had been driving near the shootout was also shot, police said. She was hospitalized with a non life-threatening gunshot wound.

Evans said video shows the officers approaching the vehicle very ""low key."" The video then shows the suspect pointing his gun at the officers' faces.

Police hoped to release the video soon for the department to be ""as transparent as possible"" in its investigation, Evans said.

""I can't say enough about the great work we did out there,"" he added.

Two other suspects were in custody ""on unrelated matters,"" police said.

Moynihan, a six-year veteran of the Boston Police Department, was one of seven officers who came to the aid of MBTA Officer Richard ""Dic"" Donohue during the Watertown, Massachusetts, shootout with the Tsarnaev brothers in 2013 shortly after the Boston Marathon bombing. He was honored at the ""Top Cops"" ceremony at the White House in 2014.

After Friday's shooting, Donohue tweeted his best wishes for Moynihan.

Hoping for the best for our BPD brother tonight

Wiltshire police released the video Friday, the same day they said James Lewis was sentenced to three years in prison. Police said he pleaded guilty to attempted armed robbery on Tuesday.

Here is the CCTV footage from a armed robbery in Shrewton where a PCSO had to bravely face the suspect wielding a knife and defend himself using a shopping basket. The suspect was disarmed and arrested. Today he was sentenced to three years in prison. Wiltshire Police are very proud of all our officers, doing their part to protect the public.

In the video from Feb. 1, a man identified by police as Lewis enters the supermarket wielding a large knife. He quickly heads toward the cashier and tries grabbing him.

The cashier manages to avoid the his grasp and runs away when he jumps over the counter.

Officers arrive at the same time as Lewis, 22, because his father had called them saying he was concerned about his son, police said.

Lewis turns his knife on the officers trying to apprehend him, the video shows. One of the officers uses a shopping basket as a shield.

An officer then enters the supermarket and tasers Lewis, who falls to the floor, drops the knife, and grabs his head in agony. Police said he had refused to drop the knife when told to do so.

The suspect allegedly lured the seven-months-pregnant woman to a Longmont home Wednesday afternoon, beat her, cut out her baby and stole the child, authorities said. Police say they arrested the suspect when she allegedly arrived at a hospital with the dead child.

The expectant mother was able to call police to come rescue her and she is being treated for her injuries and is expected to survive, Longmont police Cmdr. Jeff Satur told ABC News.

""She is alert, answering questions and is with family,"" Satur said of the victim.

The suspect has been identified in the probable cause affidavit as Dynel Catrece Lane, 34

Lane and her husband allegedly arrived at the Longmont United Hospital, claiming Lane had had a miscarriage, KMGH reported. The husband has not been identified by police and has not been charged in connection with the incident. His role in the alleged attack, if any, is unclear.

Lane was arrested at 7:46 p.m. Wednesday, about five hours after police responded to a call placed by the victim from the house where she was attacked.

Lane reportedly holds an expired nurse’s aide license in Colorado and has at least two other children, according to ABC News affiliate KMGH.

Lane faces charges of attempted first-degree murder, first degree assault, and child abuse resulting in death, though more charges may be added in relation to the death of the child. If it’s proven that the attack caused the child’s death, Lane could face a homicide charge.

Boulder County District Attorney Stan Garnett said at a news conference today the baby will undergo an autopsy to help determine whether the baby lived outside its mother.

""Under Colorado law essentially there's no way that murder charges can be brought unless ...[it is] established that the fetus lived outside the mother,"" Garnett said.

The 26-year-old victim, whose name has not been released, did not know Lane prior to the Wednesday attack, Satur, the Longmont police commander, said. She was found in the basement of the home where she was attacked. Police said they found that she had been beaten.

Police released a recording of the 911 call, in which the victim is heard telling the operator that she did not know the suspect's name and had been stabbed with a knife and broken glass.

Investigators are seeking the public’s help to determine whether any other expectant mothers had responded to the suspect's ad.

Lane was scheduled to make her first court appearance this afternoon.

Craigslist has been used several times in the past to lure unsuspecting would-be victims. Last month, a college student in Georgia was killed after authorities said he responded to an ad for an iPhone 6.

Craigslist did not immediately respond to an ABC News’ request for comment.

1xk2e0Q,2015-03-28 00:00:00,"Germanwings Co-Pilot Andreas Lubitz Never Submitted Sick Note, Airline Says - ABC News",http://abcnews.go.com/International/germanwings-pilot-andreas-lubitz-hidden-illness-german-prosecutor/story?id=29946898,"The airline whose plane crashed in the French Alps never received the sick note that investigators found torn up in the apartment of the co-pilot who allegedly hid an illness from his employers before allegedly causing the fatal crash, it was revealed today.

Germanwings said in a statement today that they never received a sick note for co-pilot Andreas Lubitz that the senior prosecutor in Dusseldorf announced they had found torn up in his apartment.

Prosecutor Christoph Kumpa had said earlier in the day that ""a torn-up current sick note ... valid for the day of the incident"" had been found, adding that it ""would -- according to preliminary evaluation -- support the assumption that the [pilot] had concealed his illness towards his employer and his occupational environment.""

Kumpa said the note found indicated the pilot ""was declared by a medical doctor unfit to work.""

The disclosure of torn medical documents at the co-pilot's home came shortly before Germanwings' parent company, Lufthansa, announced that it would be changing company policy to require two ""authorized persons"" remain in the cockpit at all times during the flight, in light of the finding that co-pilot Andreas Lubitz apparently stopped the captain from re-entering the cockpit and forced the plane to crash.

In addition to the findings suggesting Lubitz was hiding an illness, a search of his apartment in Dusseldorf yielded no suicide note and the city's prosecutor announced that there is no evidence that political or religious factors were involved in the crash.

Officials seized medical documents at Lubitz's home that indicated ""an existing illness and appropriate medical treatment,"" Senior State Prosecutor Ralf Herrenbrueck said in the statement, according to the Associated Press.

Torn up prescriptions and notes from doctors ""support the current preliminary assessment that the deceased hid his illness from his employer and colleagues,"" the statement said, according to the AP.

The Wall Street Journal cited a friend of Lubitz who said that he suffered from depression and actively concealed that diagnosis from his employer. ABC News has not independently confirmed this account.

Dusseldorf University Hospital confirmed Lubitz was a patient there and his last visit was two weeks before the crash. They denied that the treatment was related to depression, but they have handed over all of his medical records to German investigators.

During a news conference on Thursday, the Lufthansa CEO said that the 27-year-old co-pilot had undergone a medical examination that included a psychological evaluation before being hired in 2013 but, unlike physicals, mental evaluations are not required annually.

The Germanwings plane crashed this past Tuesday in the Alps in southern France with 150 people on board, including two babies, the airline said. French President Francois Hollande said there were ""apparently no survivors.""

Brice Robin, public prosecutor of Marseille, France, said in a news conference Thursday that Lubitz appeared to want to ""destroy the plane,"" purposefully locking the captain out of the Airbus A320's cockpit and accelerating the descent manually.

That’s a year with no hot showers, cold beers or the touch of his family. Kelly’s girlfriend Amiko Kauderer said she can’t call him, but he can call her, so will keep her cell phone close. It will be tough, but she said the reunion when he comes back will be special.

""For me it’s like the most romantic long-distance relationship ever,"" Kauderer said.

There are some amenities on the space station -- the views are out of this world, zero gravity gymnastics, and being an astronaut is still an elite job. Kelly knows that duty on the space station can mean fixing the toilet one week and being out on a spacewalk the next week.

Scott, 51, and his twin brother, retired astronaut Mark, will both be human guinea pigs. NASA will be comparing what happens to Scott’s body and brain to those of his brother Mark, while Mark is on the ground.

Mark said this will double what we know about spaceflight and the human body. ""Maybe there is a little cliff out there that you fall off with regards to the radiation, bone mass, bone density, those type of things, so, I am all in,"" Mark said.

Scott admits it will be a tough year -- and he should know. He has pulled one six-month stint on the space station already. After ""about four months, you start thinking, you know, there is a lot of stuff I miss on Earth. I feel like I have accomplished everything I need to, and I am sorta ready to go home.”

On a year-long mission, the intense yearning to go home could come later, he said, noting he hopes that yearning comes about ""two-thirds of the way into the mission.""

""I am kinda hoping it occurs then,"" Scott said.

Flight surgeon Dr. Stevan Gilmore is overseeing the research for this year in space. He knows how tough zero gravity is on the human body, and what NASA needs to know before they send humans off on a three-year round trip mission to Mars. This, he said, is an important step.

“We want to understand, is there anything that pops up between the six- and twelve-month duration so that we know if there are any large barriers out there for new missions,"" Gilmore said.

NASA really wants this to lead to a Mars mission. That’s why Mark Kelly agreed to the research.

""We need to figure out how people are going to live in space for really long periods of time, especially if we want to send somebody to Mars. We want to one day build a base on the Moon. Our experience with long-duration flight is six months,"" Mark said.

Despite all the possible dangerous side effects, the twins said they believe they are blazing a path that will take humans into space. Mark admits he has the easy job saying on earth, but noted that without taking risks, ""we don’t go anywhere, we don’t learn anything, we don’t get better at anything. So, risk-taking has always been a part of the space program and always will, but in this case there is extra risk.”

What will Scott miss when he is in space for a year? All the holidays, his children’s birthdays, and good food, he said.

“The menu of food [in space] is not as large a variety as you would like, even though the weather inside the space station is generally perfect, you miss the rain, the breeze, the change of seasons,"" Scott said."

The man went to a California Lottery office Thursday to claim his winning $1,098,674 Powerball ticket but realized he had lost it, a California Lottery spokesman told ABC News today.

The prize money, now expired, is being donated to California public schools, he said.

""We believe the man who came forward yesterday was the actual guy in the surveillance footage,"" the spokesman said,"" but unfortunately, in Powerball rules, you have to have a physical ticket to win.""

The man's name is not being revealed at this time, the spokesman said.

Lottery officials released surveillance video on Wednesday of the man, who they believed was the winner, purchasing the winning ticket at Rosemead Supermarket last year, the spokesman said.

They had been looking for the mystery man for 180 days since Sept. 13 of last year when his winning numbers were drawn, the spokesman added.

The man came forward when a retailer at the supermarket recognized him and informed him of his unclaimed prize, the spokesman said.

The winner's ticket matched the numbers 37, 6,1, 53 and 16, missing only the Powerball number 27 to win the big prize, the spokesman added.

But an ABC News investigation has confirmed that several hundred vehicles from various automakers were sold with open recalls at over 100 dealerships across the United States. Most of those sales occurred just in the second part of 2014.

So ""GMA"" Investigates went undercover to several new car dealerships in New York and New Jersey to find out if new cars with open recalls might be sold to an ABC News producer. When asked specifically about open recalls, some salespeople checked and told the producer that the vehicles did, in fact, have recalls.

Another salesperson told ABC News that the cars had no recalls, when a simple computer check would have disclosed an open safety recall. The ABC News producer spoke with a salesman named Arnie at Hawthorne Chevrolet, in Hawthorne, New Jersey, regarding the purchase of a brand new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck. Before arriving at the dealership, ABC News identified a potentially dangerous open safety recall on the vehicle – some vehicles can shift into neutral unexpectedly, losing power in the middle of traffic, for example. But when the producer asked Arnie about open recalls on the nearly $50,000 vehicle, he said there were none.

“Absolutely not,” Arnie told the ABC News producer. ABC News is choosing not to use Arnie's last name.

Although car salespeople like Arnie are not legally required to inform customers about the recall, the dealership is required by law to fix the recall before it is sold. So, the producer gave Arnie a $500 purchase deposit on the vehicle over the phone – and returned two days later to finish the sale.

After driving off the dealership lot with his newly purchased truck, the ABC News producer, along with ABC News Correspondent Gio Benitez, checked the truck’s VIN number on the General Motors website and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) database to see if the recall had, in fact, been fixed by the Hawthorne Chevrolet dealership.

“There it is, 2014 Chevy Silverado. Recall incomplete,” Benitez said as he read the GM website results. “The customer would experience a loss of motive power which could increase the risk of a crash. That’s a serious recall that needs to be fixed.”

A loss of motive power means a vehicle can unexpectedly shift into neutral.

So ""GMA"" Investigates returned to Hawthorne Chevrolet for an explanation.

“You sold [our producer] this car and you said there were no recalls on it. But in fact there are recalls on it. In fact a very serious one,” Benitez said.

Arnie expressed surprise that there was a recall on the truck.

“I have to check it out and see. I wasn’t aware,” Arnie answered.

But Benitez wanted to know why Arnie told the producer there was no recall, if he was not sure.

“Why did you say though that there wasn’t a recall?” Benitez asked.

“I don’t remember even talking about that,” Arnie answered.

Benitez then played video footage for Arnie, taken on the producer’s undercover cameras. After viewing video where he said the truck has no recalls, Arnie admitted his error to Benitez.

“When you get a new car it’s always supposed to have all the recalls...to be taken care of,” Arnie said. “And I made a mistake I guess. But I’ll follow up from now on, on all the cars.”

In a statement to ABC News, the president of Hawthorne Chevrolet said: “We have realized that our failure was tied exclusively to human error … From now on we will be cross-checking serial numbers with our service records, prior to delivery, to ensure that each vehicle has been properly tended to.” He told ABC News they have added an extra step to their sales process -- checking VINS at time of sale before delivery -- to make sure this never happens again.

General Motors, the manufacturer of the Chevrolet Silverado, told ABC News it “instructs its dealers to complete all open recalls on new and used vehicles prior to sale and delivery to customer.” GM added they have a completion rate of 86 percent on the unwanted transfer case shift to neutral recall, meaning that about 402,000 of the 467,000 recalled vehicles have been fixed. The recall also affected 2014 GMC Sierra 1500s and certain 2015 Chevrolet Silverados, Suburbans, Tahoes, GMC Sierras, Yukons and Yukon XLs.

NHTSA, the government agency responsible for policing new car dealers on open safety recalls, has fined only two dealerships in 2014 for not adhering to federal law.

NHTSA declined an on-camera interview with ABC News, but they defended their enforcement efforts in light of budget restraints. They said in a statement: “Selling a new vehicle that is under recall but has not been remedied is a violation of the law and a risk to public safety. There is no excuse for dealers to sell new vehicles while under recall, and NHTSA has penalized dealers who have failed to meet their safety responsibilities, including two in just the last six months. Anyone with information about dealers selling new cars with safety defects should provide that information to NHTSA so we can investigate and hold dealers accountable for any violations.""

National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA), which represents more than 16,200 new car and truck dealerships in the U.S., told “GMA” Investigates, “While we do not comment on how the law may apply to individual situations, auto retailers should comply with all applicable federal, state and local laws and operate their businesses in accord with the highest standards.”

ABC News discussed some of its findings from the investigation with Sen. Ed Markey, D-Massachusetts, who sits on the Senate subcommittee on consumer protection.

“Senator, we found hundreds and hundreds of new cars that have recalls on them. And guess what? They were sold,” Benitez revealed.

“Yeah – and that’s just wrong,” Markey responded.

Markey, who says the law barring dealers from selling new cars with open recalls is not enough on its own, said NHTSA needs to do more to enforce it.

“NHTSA has 51 people on its enforcement team. We have a couple of producers looking at this – and we pulled up hundreds and hundreds of cars with these issues,” Benitez said. “Why can’t NHTSA?”

“NHTSA should have done this work,” Markey answered. “It shouldn't take an investigation by ABC to find this problem.”

Customers shopping for a new car can do their own investigating to help protect themselves from such recalls, by checking their car’s VIN number on NHTSA’s database or the car manufacturer’s website.

Customers can also check their car’s VIN number for free on the MyCarFax mobile application. The application allows customers to plug a license plate or VIN number into the CarFax database to locate any open recalls on the car. It will also alert customers in the case of a future recall."

Mike Pence Says Controversial 'Religious Freedom' Law Won't Change - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/indiana-gov-mike-pence-controversial-religious-freedom-law/story?id=29985752,"Indiana's controversial Religious Freedom Restoration Act will not be changing despite critics saying it allows business owners to discriminate against members of the LGBT community, state Gov. Mike Pence said today during an exclusive interview on ABC's ""This Week.""

Pence described the media coverage and opposition to the law as ""shameless rhetoric,"" saying it strengthens the foundation of First Amendment rights rather than discriminates.

“We're not going to change the law,"" he said, ""but if the general assembly in Indiana sends me a bill that adds a section that reiterates and amplifies and clarifies what the law really is and what it has been for the last 20 years, than I'm open to that.""

When ABC's George Stephanopoulos asked Pence if the law allowed businesses like florists to refuse to work with gay or lesbian weddings, as critics have said, the governor said the situation has more to do with whether the government is involved.

""The question here is if there is a government action or a law that an individual believes impinges on their religious liberty, they have the opportunity to go to court, just as the Religious Freedom and Reformation Act that Bill Clinton signed allowed them, to go to court and the court would evaluate the circumstance under the standards articulated in this act,"" Pence said.

Pence, a Republican, signed the Indiana Religious Freedom and Restoration Act into Indiana law Thursday. It intends to prevent the government from infringing on individual’s religious beliefs, Pence said, but opponents say the law allows business owners to use religion as a reason to legally discriminate against members of the LGBT community.

A federal version of the religious freedom law was enacted in 1993 but dozens of states have passed their own versions since then, including one passed unanimously in Illinois when President Barack Obama was a state senator. Illinois added specific protection from discrimination based on sexual orientation several years after passing its version of the law.

Pence touted bipartisan support for the law, saying that President Obama and Democratic leaders like Nancy Pelosi supported similar legislation.

White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said the governor was in damage control mode.

“If you have to go back two decades to try to justify something that you're doing today, it may raise some questions about the wisdom of what you're doing,” he said on ""This Week."" ""It should be easy for leaders in this country to stand up and say that it is wrong to discriminate against people just because of who they love.""

The Indiana law gained national attention quickly after it was signed when the NCAA, which is based in Indianapolis, released a statement expressing concern that the law would negatively impact athletes and visitors in town for the Final Four games of its men's basketball tournament. Several businesses, including Yelp, have threatened to take their business away from the state."

Kay Hafford, 28, was driving to work Friday when another driver allegedly shot her from his vehicle.

She was taken to the Memorial Hermann Texas Trauma Institute where her condition improved throughout the weekend. She had been listed in good condition Sunday morning before she was discharged later Sunday afternoon.

The altercation took place after Hafford got onto the interstate and honked her horn at a driver in a white SUV, police said.

Harris County assistant Chief Deputy Mark Herman said the suspect then starting heckling Hafford, before shooting her.

Hafford didn't realize she had been shot at first. She pulled over her car and called 911 after the suspect fired one shot at her right window -- only realizing while on the phone that she was bleeding.

""She blacked out several times at the scene but she was coherent enough to give investigators some information about the case,"" Herman said.

No suspect has been arrested yet, police said. But, the suspect was last seen Friday driving what police believe was a white Chevy Tahoe."

The aircraft and defense company has taken a cue from science fiction with its plan to develop a Star Wars-style force field that would use energy to deflect any potential damage.

Just liking the luminescent shields seen in the film, Boeing's ""Method and system for shock wave attenuation via electromagnetic arc"" could provide a real-life layer of protection from nearby impacts to targets.

The downside: It won't protect from direct hits.

The system can sense when a shock wave generating explosion occurs near a target. An arc generator then determines the small area where protection is needed from the shock waves.

It then springs into action by by emitting laser pulses that ionize the air, providing a laser-induced plasma field of protection from the shock waves.

""Explosive devices are being used increasingly in asymmetric warfare to cause damage and destruction to equipment and loss of life. The majority of the damage caused by explosive devices results from shrapnel and shock waves,"" the patent says.

While Boeing may been granted the patent, it's unclear how long it will be before the company deploys the real-life force fields."

Unlike its modern relatives, the Carolina Butcher was land dwelling and likely snacked on smaller prey, including armored relatives and early mammal relatives, according to researchers at North Carolina State University and the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences.

The fearsome 9-foot animal that lived 230 million years ago in the wet, warm region of the super-continent Pangaea that is now North Carolina.

Paleontologists were able to glean new insights about the fearsome animal that lived 230 million years ago by analyzing broken pieces of the crocodile's skull, spine and leg that were found in the Pekin Formation in Chatham County.

The bones were scanned and paleontologists were able to create a 3-D model of the animal, providing a clearer picture of the creature.

""If you want to picture these animals, just think of a modern day fox, but with alligator skin instead of fur,"" Susan Drymala, a co-author of the paper in Scientific Reports, said in a statement.

The Carolina Butcher's reign of terror didn't last long, according to researchers. It was killed off as the Triassic period came to an end, making way for even more terrifying predatory dinosaurs."

Stephen Scipione, president of the Virginia Alpha Chapter of Phi Kappa Psi, said in a statement, ""These false accusations have been extremely damaging to our entire organization, but we can only begin to imagine the setback this must have dealt to survivors of sexual assault.”

He continued, “We hope that Rolling Stone’s actions do not discourage any survivors from coming forward to seek the justice they deserve.”

Phi Psi has been working with the Charlottesville police throughout the investigation, the statement said.

""Following the publication of the defamatory article, the chapter launched an extensive internal investigation, which quickly confirmed that the horrific events described in the Rolling Stone article did not occur,"" the statement said. ""Both the Virginia Alpha chapter and Phi Psi’s national organization adhere to a strict zero tolerance policy in regards to sexual assault.""

Phi Psi said it is ""exploring its legal options to address the extensive damage caused by Rolling Stone.""

The woman, identified as ""Jackie,"" alleged in a Rolling Stone article that she was gang-raped by seven men at a UVA Phi Psi fraternity party on Sept. 28, 2012.

But police said today they were not able to conclude that an incident occurred at Phi Psi that night.

Police said ""we can't say something didn't happen"" to her, but they have ""no basis"" to conclude anything happened at Phi Psi.

During the investigation, police talked to about 70 people, including Jackie's friends and fraternity members, Charlottesville Police Chief Tim Longo said. Investigators talked to nine of the 11 Phi Psi members living in the house at the time, and none of them knew Jackie or had any knowledge of the alleged assault, Longo said, also noting that Jackie declined to be interviewed by police for the investigation.

Police also found no evidence that a party or event took place at Phi Psi on Sept. 28, 2012, noting that a time-stamped photo from that night shows the house practically empty, Longo said.

In January, a police investigation cleared Phi Psi of any involvement in the alleged rape and the fraternity was reinstated on campus.

Longo noted today that the case is not closed, but is suspended until they are able to gather more information.

Durst owned a health food store called All Good Things in Middlebury at the same time 18-year-old Lynne Schulze was reported missing, police said.

""We are aware of the connection between Robert Durst and the disappearance of Lynne Schulze. We have been aware of this connection for several years and have been working with various outside agencies as we follow this lead,"" Middlebury police said in a statement today.

""This is an ongoing criminal investigation and the Middlebury Police Department is not releasing any other details,"" the statement continued.

Police are examining Durst's actions in connection with five deaths or disappearances in four states: two in California, one in New York, one in Texas and one in Vermont, according to law enforcement authorities.

On March 14, Durst was arrested by FBI agents at a New Orleans hotel in connection with the death of his friend Susan Berman in Los Angeles in 2000.

Durst's attorneys have said Durst is innocent.

""Bob Durst didn't kill Susan Berman and he doesn't know who did,"" Dick DeGuerin, his attorney, said outside court last Tuesday.

Durst has denied killing Berman, but some believed he had a motive, allegedly wanting to silence her about the 1982 disappearance of his first wife, Kathleen Durst, in New York.

Kathleen Durst was officially declared dead in 2001, and Durst has said he has no idea what happened to her.

Durst is also being examined in connection with the 1997 disappearance of 16-year-old Karen Mitchell.

Mitchell was last seen at a mall in Eureka, California, police said. Durst was living in Trinidad, California at the time, which is 25 miles north of the mall.

Investigators never arrested anyone in connection with Mitchell's case, though they do believe she ""met foul play.""

""We are certainly interested in any information that may or may not come out of interviews with Mr. Durst,"" Eureka police chief Andy Mills told ABC affiliate KAEF. ""If information comes to us that allows us to further our investigation we will certainly take the opportunity to do that.""

Durst was also charged in the 2001 killing of a neighbor in Galveston, Texas, but he claimed self-defense and was later found not guilty."

Asia Ford, 35, of Louisville, only wanted to beat her personal record from last year in her second 10K race over the weekend. Ford, a customer service representative for Time Warner Cable, said she decided about two years ago to turn her life around after she and her former husband experienced health issues.

Her husband had lost a hand and a leg, in part because of diabetes, and a doctor told her that she needed a knee replacement.

The mother of three turned to a friend who's a fitness enthusiast and joined a boot camp called Aspirations. She lost 217 pounds over the span of just over two years.

After mile four in Saturday's Rodes City Run 10K race, Ford said she started to feel ""dizzy and sick.""

""I told my son, 'If anything happens, I want you to call 911,'"" she told ABC News. ""EMS was on the side of me. The EMS driver got out and was trying to take me to the EMS. He said, 'You're going to finish this race, aren't you?'""

She said she was just getting over pneumonia and finishing her antibiotics.

""During mile five, I started crying because I knew my body was experiencing a shutdown,"" she said. ""I had one mile in front of me and said to my son, 'It's time to quit.' I asked, 'God, please let me take a few more steps.' Right when I said that, God brought this man.""

That man was Louisville Metropolitan Police Lt. Aubrey Gregory. He helped Ford reach a personal record of two hours and seven minutes, which is three minutes shorter than her time last year.

""He said, 'I want you to look straight ahead of you. We have nothing but a mile ahead of you,'"" Ford said.

Today, Ford and Gregory will be honored by the Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer.

Texas resident Robert Wright, 49, told ABC News today he flew with his father to their former home this past weekend to pick up the 1978 time capsule and its contents -- a letter Wright wrote to himself, a McDonald's scratch card game, newspaper clippings and coins.

""It was surreal,"" Wright said. ""I never thought I'd see it again.""

Wright said making the capsule was a ""spur-of-the-moment"" kind of thing.

""My dad was redoing the interior wall inside the house,"" he said, ""so I decided I wanted to throw something in before he sealed it.""

Wright wrote a note saying: ""Hello to whoever finds this. My name is Robert Wright. Today my dad is putting up paneling. Today is November 18th, 1978, 15 till 12:00 noon. I'm 12 years old and a student at Fontana JR. High, 7th grade. I am 5'3, blond hair, hazel eyes. Here is proof of the date. Robert Wright.""

He then gathered a few trinkets from his room, put everything in a bag and hid it behind the wall, he said.

The capsule remained hidden until six years ago when it was discovered by the home's current owner, Greg Sandoval, while he was doing a renovation.

""As time went by, I didn’t want to throw it away,"" Sandoval told ABC News last December. ""After six years, I decided to do something about it and called my local ABC station here in Los Angeles.”

The story was also aired by a local ABC affiliate in Houston, near where Wright lives, and he got in touch with Sandoval shortly after, he said. Since he was going to be in the West Coast for a conference in a few months, he decided to pick it up personally, he added.

Wright's two boys, ages eight and nine, are going to make their own time capsules they'll hide away during their house remodeling this upcoming summer, he said.

""Who knows? Maybe 50 years from now, someone will find their things, and they'll have a cool story to tell,"" Wright said."

Search warrants were served by the Anchorage Police Department at the Alaska Cannabis Club in Anchorage, Alaska, last Friday. The Alaska Cannabis Club is owned by former KTVA reporter Charlene Egby.

“Police received reports of the illegal sale of marijuana and other derivatives at a location that's been identified as the Alaska Cannabis Club,” the Anchorage Police Department said in a statement on its website.

Egby, known professionally as Charlo Greene, told ABC News she was not surprised by the raid.

“I have to stress that no arrests were made and no citations were issued. The police did however destroy the 9 mature and about a dozen immature medical cannabis plants on site - all within the legal cultivation bounds - and confiscated cellphones, computers and 2 vehicles (one of which was not included in the warrant),” Greene told ABC News in a statement.

Greene was reporting live for KTVA on the Alaska Cannabis Club in September, when she admitted to viewers that she actually owned the club and was quitting her job to fight for the legalization of marijuana.

The Alaska Cannabis Club is a network of medical marijuana patients throughout Alaska, Greene said. Since leaving KTVA, Greene said she’s received multiple job offers.

“On the local, on the national and on the international level, I've been receiving job offers,” Greene told ABC News’ “20/20” in an interview in October 2014. “I'm not going anywhere. You're going to see a lot more of me.”

Greene declined to name where any of the job offers were from.

“That decision was made before we started even filming that day story. I knew this was going to be my exit. All of it was planned out, top to bottom,” Greene said.

Greene added that her life has been turned upside-down since she said, “F*** it, I quit” on the air.

“I wasn't expecting that to be, like, the F-bomb heard ‘round the world or anything like that,” Greene said last October.

In a statement the day after Greene quit, KTVA News Director Bert Rudman said, “[Greene] had a personal and business stake in the issue she was reporting, but did not disclose that interest to us. This betrayed the basic bedrock of responsible journalism.”

Regardless of the criticism over her viral resignation, Greene said she doesn't regret reporting on the Alaska Cannabis Club without disclosing that she owned it.

“The Alaska Cannabis Club is my business,” Greene said in October. “I have a degree in journalism. I know all about ethics. I made a choice, and I'm unapologetic in it.”"

Kenai police say Rebecca Adams, 23, Brandon Jividen, 38, and Adams' children, Jaracca Hundley, 3, and Michelle Hundley, 6, along with the family dog, Sparks, were reported missing in May 2014.

Police also said items observed at the scene seem to match those identified as missing from the family residence. ""A very preliminary scene assessment has revealed information that points to the Kenai family that turned up missing in May of 2014,"" officials said in the statement.

Police said they were not able to conclude that an incident occurred at the Phi Kappa Psi house on Sept. 28, 2012.

""We have no evidence that supports those assertions"" in the article, Charlottesville Police Chief Tim Longo said.

The woman, identified as ""Jackie,"" alleged in the article that she was gang-raped by seven men at a UVA Phi Psi fraternity party in September 2012.

Police said today ""we can't say something didn't happen"" to her, but they have ""no substantive basis"" to conclude anything happened at Phi Psi.

During the investigation, police talked to about 70 people, including Jackie's friends and fraternity members, Longo said. Investigators talked to nine of the 11 Phi Psi members living in the house at the time, and none of them knew Jackie or had any knowledge of the alleged assault, Longo said.

Police also found no evidence that a party or event took place at Phi Psi on Sept. 28, 2012, noting that a time-stamped photo from that night shows the house practically empty, Longo said.

In January, a police investigation cleared Phi Psi of any involvement in the alleged rape and the fraternity was reinstated on campus.

Longo noted today that the case is not closed, but is suspended until they are able to gather more information.

It is a ""disservice"" to Jackie and the university, Longo said, to close the case without allowing the opportunity for additional information to come forward.

""There's no statute of limitations of this particular type of crime,"" Longo said, noting that Jackie declined to be questioned by police investigators.

UVA President Teresa Sullivan said in a statement today that the investigation confirms what federal privacy law prohibited the university from sharing last fall: ""That the University provided support and care to a student in need, including assistance in reporting potential criminal conduct to law enforcement. Chief Longo's report underscores what I have known since well before the publication of the Rolling Stone article: that we at the University are committed to ensuring the health and safety of all of our students.""

After the article was published, the magazine quickly backpedaled on the story and Rolling Stone Managing Editor Will Dana said the author of the feature, Sabrina Rubin Erdely, did not talk to any of the students involved in the alleged rape before publishing the story out of respect for Jackie.

""We were trying to be sensitive to the unfair shame and humiliation many women feel after a sexual assault and now regret the decision to not contact the alleged assaulters to get their account,"" Dana wrote in a letter published on the magazine's website. ""We are taking this seriously and apologize to anyone who was affected by the story.""

In a series of tweets in December, Dana said, ""We made a judgment -- the kind of judgement reporters and editors make every day. And in this case, our judgement was wrong.""

""We should have either not made this agreement with Jackie ... or worked harder to convince her that the truth would have been better served by getting the other side of the story,"" Dana continued. ""That failure is on us -- not on her.""

University President Teresa Sullivan also released a statement at the time, saying that university officials are ""first and foremost concerned with the care and support of our students and, especially, any survivor of sexual assault.""

The Columbia University Journalism School is also conducting a review of the Rolling Stone article and is expected to release its findings in the next few weeks.

Rolling Stone said in a statement today that the magazine ""expects the Columbia Journalism School's report on 'A Rape on Campus' imminently and we will be publishing it in the next couple of weeks. The report will provide a thorough analysis of the editorial process surrounding this piece.""

Erdley has not spoken. Jackie's attorney declined comment in response to today's news conference.

Kraft was on the stand in the Fall River Justice Center in Fall River, Massachusetts, about 40 miles south of Gillette Stadium, where Kraft said he last spoke to Hernandez for about ""five to 10 minutes."" Kraft said he ""vaguely"" remembered that Hernandez told him he was ""completely innocent.""

Hernandez, 25, is charged with killing Odin Lloyd on June 17, 2013. Lloyd, 27, was dating the sister of Hernandez's fiancee and was found shot to death in an industrial park less than a mile from a home that Hernandez and his fiancee shared.

Kraft said he approached Hernandez on June 19, 2013, in the weight room of Gillette Stadium and asked to speak with him. At that time, media were reporting about Hernandez's involvement in the incident.

Kraft mostly answered ""yes"" and ""no"" to questions from both the defense and prosecution, revealing that the businessman had ""no problems"" with Hernandez in the stadium, but admitted to an attorney that he didn't know much about the player's life outside of the stadium.

""You were at Gillette stadium and you saw all the media assembled there,"" an attorney asked Kraft. ""The media coverage at that point was non-stop and it was extensive. And that bothered you, didn't it?""

Kraft then answered ""yes.""

Kraft said earlier when he took the stand, ""I had heard there was an incident that had transpired,"" and that he had asked Hernandez ""whether he was involved.""

""Any player involved in our system ... I consider family,"" Kraft said. ""I wanted to get him help.""

""He hugged and kissed me and thanked me for my concern,"" Kraft said of Hernandez, saying he didn't see Hernandez after that conversation.

The defense attorney asked questions about Hernandez's contract through the 2018 season, asking why Kraft would make such a long-term investment in the player, to which Kraft responded, ""He's a very good player.""

Last month, a trainer that's not employed by the team testified in the trial. Coach Bill Belichick and linebacker Brandon Spikes are on the witness list, but it's not clear if they will be called to the stand."
1xWP05p,2015-03-23 00:00:00,The Surprising Things Steve Jobs' New Biography Says About Him - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Business/surprising-things-steve-jobs-biography/story?id=29840799,"The latest unauthorized book about Apple co-founder Steve Jobs portrays a different side from what is often shared of the legendary entrepreneur. And this time, the story of Jobs is getting a warm reception from company executives.

""Becoming Steve Jobs: The Evolution of a Reckless Upstart into a Visionary Leader,"" to be released Tuesday, has received support from Apple CEO Tim Cook and other executives who knew Jobs. Those same executives criticized the best-selling ""Steve Jobs"" released by noted biographer Walter Isaacson shortly after Jobs' death in 2011 at age 55.

""What surprised me about him always was how funny he was and pleasant,"" Brent Schlender, co-author of ""Becoming Steve Jobs,"" told ABC News' Deborah Roberts. Schlender spent 25 years following Jobs, including sitting down with him in a personal audio interview in 1998.

""There's people who don't perform. I have to take them out of their jobs. It's harder now ... much harder than before I had kids,"" Jobs can be heard saying in that interview, which was played on ""Good Morning America."" ""Because I look at everybody and I think of them as 5 years old.""

Cook and other colleagues have openly criticized Isaacson's book but have been praising ""Becoming Steve Jobs.""

""It didn't capture the person,"" Cook is quoted as saying in the new book regarding Isaacson's biography. ""The person I read about there is somebody I would never have wanted to work with over all this time.""

Last week, Apple's software chief Eddy Cue endorsed the latest book.

Best portrayal is about to be released - Becoming Steve Jobs (book). Well done and first to get it right.

Rick Tetzeli, co-author of ""Becoming Steve Jobs,"" told Roberts, ""I was really surprised at the intensity of his close relationships.""

When Jobs needed a liver transplant in 2009, Cook offered his, but Jobs refused.

And though stories like those in Isaacson's book portray Jobs as being temperamental or controlling, the new book emphasizes how Jobs valued teamwork, drawing parallels with how ""The Beatles"" became an iconic band.

""It's that idea of brilliant people working together making up for one another's weaknesses and emphasizing their strengths,"" Tetzeli told ABC News.

In 1983, Jobs hired John Sculley as Apple's CEO and a power struggle ensued. Two years later, Apple's board of directors sided with Sculley and removed Jobs as head of the Macintosh group. Jobs soon left the company.

Tetzeli adds, ""He could be brash and he could be insufferable. But he learned a lot after getting exiled from Apple. When he came back he was a very different person.""

""The young Steve Jobs never could have engineered the brilliant comeback that Apple experienced over the last 15 years,"" Tetzeli adds.

Schlender said Jobs' affinity for Buddhism drove his perfectionism.

""If you're only gonna live here once, you need to make the most of every moment and you need to try to pick the thing where you can give the most back. ... He may have seemed like a jerk sometimes, but what was driving it was this idealism,"" Schlender told ABC News.

Schlender said Jobs' presence is still palpable around the Cupertino-based company.

""There may not be a Steve, but the spirit of Steve is still there,"" he said.

Isaacson could not be reached for comment today by ABC News."

It all began on Tuesday at 7:03 a.m. when the 18-wheeler transporting three elephants pulled off the road on Interstate 49 near the Powhatan exit in Louisiana and got stuck in the mud, the Natchitoches Parish Sheriff's office said in a statement.

""When deputies arrived on scene, they were astounded to find two elephants keeping the eighteen wheeler from overturning,"" the sheriff's office said.

The merger deal, announced today by both companies, was engineered by Heinz's owner, the Brazilian investment firm 3G Capital, and billionaire investor Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, which shares ownership of Heinz.

3G has a big appetite for food brands, previously gobbling up Burger King in 2010, and the Canadian restaurant chain Tim Hortons last year.

The combined company's brands include Kraft, Heinz, Oscar Mayer deli meats, Planters nuts and Maxwell House Coffee.

But these are challenging times for packaged food companies. Because of changing consumer tastes many well-known food brands are struggling with declining sales. Kraft’s profit last year fell more than 60 percent.

3G has won praise on Wall Street for deal-making and competent management as well as cost-cutting.

Both companies' boards have unanimously approved the deal, which is targeted to close in the second half of the year. It still needs approval from Kraft shareholders."

Middlebury police are now looking for tips as they investigate any potential connection between Durst and the 1971 cold case disappearance of 18-year-old Lynne Schulze.

The real estate heir moved to Vermont in 1971, Middlebury police said at a press conference Tuesday, and his wife Kathleen Durst joined him later. Durst spent no more than two years in the state, police added.

The police confirmed Tuesday that Schulze purchased dried prunes from Durst's health food store called All Good Things the day she went missing. But authorities cannot confirm if Durst was working that day. It's unknown if Durst and Schulze ever had any personal contact, according to police.

Last year police searched Durst's former property in the area, but didn't find anything of interest in Schulze's case, they said.

Schulze's body was never found, police said.

On Monday the department said in a statement, ""We are aware of the connection between Robert Durst and the disappearance of Lynne Schulze."" But Tuesday the police said they haven't received any tips since Monday's release and they are looking to talk to anyone with information.

The police are working with other agencies and the investigation is still open, the police said today.

On March 14, Durst was arrested in connection with the death of his friend Susan Berman in Los Angeles in 2000.

Durst's attorneys have said Durst is innocent.

""Bob Durst didn't kill Susan Berman and he doesn't know who did,"" Dick DeGuerin, his attorney, said last week.

While Durst has denied killing Berman, some believed he had a motive, allegedly wanting to silence her about the 1982 disappearance of his first wife, Kathleen Durst.

Kathleen Durst was officially declared dead in 2001, and Durst has said he has no idea what happened to her.

Durst was also charged in the 2001 killing of a neighbor in Galveston, Texas, but he claimed self-defense and was later found not guilty.

Durst is also being examined in connection with the 1997 disappearance of 16-year-old Karen Mitchell in Eureka, California. Mitchell's body was never found.

Durst is currently being held in New Orleans on weapons charges."

The students and teachers from Joseph Konig School were returning home from a Spanish language exchange program aboard the Germanwings Airbus A320 when it crashed.

The plane was traveling from Barcelona, Spain, to Dusseldorf, Germany, when it suddenly began a rapid descent from its cruising altitude at 38,000 feet. It plunged 32,000 feet in eight minutes, according to Germanwings. When the plane was at 6,000 feet, it lost contact with air traffic control.

The plane was carrying 144 passengers, including two babies, and six crew members, Germanwings CEO Thomas Winkelmann said at a news conference Tuesday.

The high school held a makeshift memorial in its gym Wednesday. Many carried candles and signs as they mourned their peers. One mourner carried a sign that said, ""Yesterday we were many. Today we are alone.""

Ina Grajestiki, a violin teacher at Joesph Konig, told ABC News, ""I don't know how to work today. ... I cannot believe this, that it's happened.""

In partnership with our sister network ESPN, ABC News reached out to every major politician who's said he or she is looking at a run for the White House. The result: Our official NCAA bracket pool for possible 2016 aspirants, live and viewable at ESPN.com--in the same format we and everyone else uses for ESPN bracket pools with our friends.

In this bracket challenge, the stakes could be presidential. See below who picked whom in the men's pool, and what it might mean for the future of the White House and the country.

The GOP's 2016 frontrunner shies away from the NCAA frontrunner, Kentucky, and picks the University of Virginia to upset the Wildcats and win it all. Through the most jaded political lens, it could be considered a play for Virginia's coveted swing-state votes in the general election--but we know the former governor isn't looking that far ahead just yet.

Bergdahl was freed after five years in Taliban captivity in a controversial deal last year in which the U.S. agreed to release five mid- to high-level Taliban figures from detention in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. As part of the deal, the Taliban five were relocated to Qatar.

After Bergdahl's dramatic return to the U.S., the Army launched an investigation into whether the soldier willfully left his post in Afghanistan before he was taken by the Taliban in 2009, as some Afghan war veterans alleged.

The Army said today Bergdahl has been charged with two counts under the Uniform Code of Military Justice: one count of “desertion with intent to shirk important or hazardous duty” and one count of “misbehavior before the enemy by endangering the safety of a command, unit or place.”

The second count is the more severe of the two, carrying a potential sentence of “confinement for life” should Bergdahl be convicted. Both charges also potentially carry a dishonorable discharge, a reduction in rank to private, and a total forfeiture of all pay and allowances.

""We ask that all Americans continue to withhold judgment until the facts of this case emerge,"" Bergdahl's attorney, Eugene Fidell, said in a statement. ""We also ask that government officials refrain from leaking information or engaging in other conduct that endangers our client's right to a fair trial.""

The Army said the case has been referred to a military preliminary hearing akin to a grand jury inquiry, which is “designed to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to merit a court-martial,” after which a higher authority will decide to go ahead with a court-martial against Bergdahl or drop the charges, among other options.

President Obama called it a ""good day"" when Bergdahl was freed, but critics, including some high-ranking Republicans, loudly denounced the deal, likening it to negotiating with terrorists. Also, lawmakers complained that Congress had not been consulted about the exchange, as they said the law requires. The White House defended the deal, saying that rescuing a prisoner of war was “absolutely the right thing to do” and that the deal had to be done secretly and urgently to be successful."

The hashtag #FindKatrinaGirl has now taken off on social media.

A 2005 photograph of the two shows the girl in pigtails and a pink shirt squeezing Michael Maroney, now a master sergeant at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas. The iconic New Orleans image has served as a symbol of hope after the devastation.

""When she wrapped me up with that hug, I just melted, and the weight of the world was lifted off my shoulders,"" Maroney, 40, told ABC News today. ""Everything in the world just stopped, and I wasn’t in New Orleans or in the devastation, I was just being hugged by a beautiful little girl.""

Maroney was part of a rescue team that saved the girl and her family stranded on a flooded street of their community, he said.

""They were in knee-high water waving at our helicopter, so I went down to help them,"" Maroney said. ""They told me their house was in ruins, and they wanted to get out.""

When he hoisted the girl up, she was all smiles, Maroney said, adding she was so enthusiastic in the helicopter, soothing her mom’s fear of heights and pointing out every single place she knew from above.

""I’ve seen a lot of destruction in my time, and New Orleans was intense, but for this girl to be happy, smiling and resilient despite the devastation was such a powerful moment,” he said. ""To be that strong, man, I swear that girl could rule the world.""

After dropping the girl and her family off at Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport, Maroney had to quickly get back to the helicopter to rescue more victims stranded by the hurricane, so he never got a chance to get the girl’s name, he said.

""I’ve thought about her and her family every day,” he said, adding he started looking for her five years ago. ""I just want to let her know how much she's inspired me and to see how she’s doing."""

The plane was en route from Barcelona, Spain, to Dusseldorf, Germany, when it crashed in the Alps, near the town of Digne, according to the airline.

The students, from Joseph King High School, had been returning from an exchange trip in Barcelona, Haltern spokesperson Florian Adamak said.

This is the ""darkest day in the history of our city,"" Haltern-am-See Mayor Bodo Klimpel said at a news conference.

Klimpel said the school would not close on Wednesday, but ""it won't be a routine day of classes.""

He said chaplains would be made available and ""the students will have the opportunity to talk about the terrible tragedy.""

""You can imagine that tomorrow is a particularly difficult day for our teachers, because they have lost two colleagues,"" Klimpel said.

The plane, an Airbus A320, was carrying 144 passengers -- including 2 babies -- and six crew members, Germanwings CEO Thomas Winkelmann said at a news conference.

There were ""apparently no survivors,"" said French President Hollande.

Germanwings said 67 Germans were on board. There were also Spanish and Turkish passengers, said Spanish King Felipe IV. The State Department is reviewing whether there were any Americans on board.

Opera singers Oleg Bryjak and Maria Radner were also among the passengers, returning from a performance in Barcelona. Radner was on the flight with her husband and baby.

The list of nationalities of the casualties will be released as soon as the airline is certain, Winkelmann said, adding that the victims' families will be informed before a list of names will be released.

The cause of the accident has not yet been determined, the Germanwings CEO said.

Lufthansa is calling the crash ""an accident.""

""For the time being we are calling this an accident,"" a Lufthansa official said at a press conference in Barcelona today. ""Everything else is speculation.""

A black box from the plane was found, the Interior Ministry confirmed, and will be analyzed in the coming hours."

""We'll be getting new health insurance and we'll presumably do it through my job with the Senate, and so we'll be on the federal exchange with millions of others,"" Cruz said in an interview with CNN Tuesday.

Cruz and his family currently have health insurance coverage through his wife’s employer, Goldman Sachs. Cruz's wife, Heidi, is a managing director at the company and will take a leave of absence to campaign for her husband, causing her family to lose their healthcare coverage, according to CNN.

Most members of Congress are required to obtain healthcare coverage through the federal exchanges established by Obamacare. The exception is for those who are covered by Medicare or receive coverage through their spouses, like Cruz previously did.

“Well, it is written in the law that members will be on the exchanges without subsidies just like millions of Americans so that's – I think the same rules should apply to all of us. Members of Congress should not be exempt,” Cruz told the Des Moines Register.

Throughout his three-year Senate career, Cruz has been on a crusade to repeal Obamacare - most notably when he led a 21-hour filibuster against the president's healthcare plan on the Senate floor in 2013. The tactic caused many people to blame Cruz for the government shutdown that lasted for 16 days.

Cruz launched his presidential campaign yesterday on the five-year anniversary of the president signing the Affordable Care Act into law and committed to repealing the legislation if he becomes president in 2017.

""Instead of the joblessness, instead of the millions forced into part-time work, instead of the millions who've lost their health insurance, lost their doctors, have faced skyrocketing health insurance premiums, imagine in 2017 a new president signing legislation repealing every word of Obamacare,"" Cruz said at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia Tuesday."

The students were uninjured and escaped with the bus driver from a rear emergency exit on the bus, which was bound for Saint Helena School, according to the Whitpain Township Police Department. The students ranged in age from 5 to 12, said the school's principal, Sister Cathe Shoulberg.

The 58-year-old male bus driver was taken to a nearby hospital to be evaluated, police said in a written statement that did not specify a reason for the hospital evaluation. The driver may have had a medical issue before the incident, ABC station WPVI reported.

""The bus driver looked absolutely lethargic, he was completely out of it,"" a neighborhood resident, Craig Kalman, told WPVI. ""He said 'I don't remember, I don't remember.'""

The driver is “loved by students and parents” and “they are very concerned about him,” Shoulberg said.

“Students said that he appeared fine this morning,” Shoulberg added.

One person was inside the house at the time of the crash, but the person was uninjured, police said. Later reports suggested additional people inside the house, but still no injuries, though police did not respond to requests for clarification.

""We were in that room five seconds before,"" homeowner Jill Lafferty told WPVI. ""The force was so great that it pushed both of us on the floor, it sounded like an explosion. I thought there was a gas leak and something exploded downstairs.""

""I said a prayer and I said, 'Thank you God that my kids were not in that room,'"" Lafferty added. ""I don’t know what could have happened. I don’t want to think about what ifs.”

Police received a report of a bus into a residence on Windermere Drive at 7:45 a.m. and continued to investigate the crash throughout the day. Police told ABC News they would be looking at video from a camera on the bus as part of the investigation and had interviewed students at the school.

Police said nine students were on the bus when it crashed, and Shoulberg said several others witnessed the accident from a bus stop. After arriving at school, Shoulberg added, the students were examined by the school nurse and deemed to be alright but shocked, and they were given soft pretzels at the principal's office."

Barrenechea, a computer science student from Massachusetts, and White, a Ph.D. candidate in the Alliance for Technology, Learning and Society program from Australia, said they first came up with the idea for the website in fall 2011.

“We were thinking about ... how information gets created and shared from the ground to social media,” Barrenechea told ABC News. “We were also thinking of what happens to pets during disasters. Pets get disconnected from their pet owners at different shelters. This is what happened in 2005 during Hurricane Katrina.”

After Hurricane Sandy, the two saw how social media, such as Facebook, became a platform for people to use to find lost items and pets.

“It’s really about the crowd,” Barrenechea said. “We see this as a crowd work situation … they can work with each other.”

Users can go on EmergencyPetMatcher and create a profile of a lost pet or of a found pet. Anyone can also propose that photos of a lost pet and a found pet are a match, which people can up-vote or down-vote. Once a match receives enough up-votes, an automatic email goes to both people who posted the photos of the lost pet and the found pet, suggesting that they contact each other.

“It’s very visually-led. It’s like a memory game. A lot of people propagate on social media after a disaster,” White told ABC News. “Everybody could get on this and play that sort of matching game.”

“We want everyone to be able to use it. We’re talking about 4th graders in elementary school ... to elderly citizens,” Barrencechea said.

While the website is ready to launch, it will only go live during the next disaster.

“We would deploy it for the entirety of an event, like a hurricane or a wildfire or an earthquake. It’s going to be a service. It’s reliable and scalable to the amount of people that use it,” said Barrencechea.

Barrenchea and White hope their website will provide a single location for people to help each other during the next disaster.

“A lot of people are looking for ways to help [during disasters]. It doesn’t matter where they are located in the world,” White said. “With this system … it allows them to be able to help."""

A small pilot study published earlier this week in Acta Paediatrica found that fetuses of smoking moms touch their face and mouth much more than fetuses of nonsmoking mothers.

Using high-definition, 4-D ultrasounds, researchers, led by Dr. Nadja Reissland of Durham University in the United Kingdom, investigated minute mouth and hand movements of the fetuses in both the smoking and nonsmoking mothers.

Four out of the 20 pregnancies studied involved mothers who smoked. Each woman had scans at four intervals between their 24th and 36th weeks of pregnancy.

Reissland said fetuses of the smoking mothers had a 58 percent increase of mouth movement and a 69 percent increase in self-touch, where the fetuses touched their face or head, compared to the unborn babies of women who didn't smoke.

Reissland said previous studies have shown that mothers with high levels of stress are connected to a high level of fetal movements, also causing stress in the unborn baby.

""Fetal facial movement patterns differ significantly between fetuses of mothers who smoked compared to those of mothers who didn’t smoke,"" Reissland said, adding that a bigger study is needed to confirm the findings.

""These results point to the fact that nicotine exposure per se has an effect on fetal development over and above the effects of stress and depression.""

The extra-movements made by the fetuses of smoking pregnancies could indicate that nicotine or other toxins from the smoke are having an effect on a fetus' development. Traditionally, Reissland said, the fetus' movement starts to lessen as they develop to full-term pregnancy.

""The brain...matures indicates certain movements for the fetus that the fetus can make, it’s a proxy for brain development,"" said Reissland. ""As they grow older, they integrate the movement [and] they make fewer but more complex movements.""

All infants in the study were born at a healthy weight and size with no obvious health issues.

“Technology means we can now see what was previously hidden, revealing how smoking affects the development of the fetus in ways we did not realize,"" study co-author Professor Brian Francis of Lancaster University said. ""This is yet further evidence of the negative effects of smoking in pregnancy.”

Reissland says she hopes to follow up with the infants of smoking mothers to see whether they show any new signs of health effects or developmental delays related to their exposure to nicotine in the womb.

Dr. Marjorie Greenfield, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at University Hospitals Case Western Reserve School of Medicine in Cleveland, was intrigued by the study but said she wants to see more evidence connecting the extra movement in the fetuses to any health effects after birth.

“I think the study is interesting in that it gives us the window to look at the effects of looking at the window on a baby,” Greenfield said. “I think it’s kind of dramatic in that, look, we can see this behavior that’s already different.”

Greenfield said the dramatic images could potentially help discourage other women from smoking during pregnancy, but said she finds the patients who continue to smoke usually have other stressors in their life or other issues that keep them from quitting smoking.

“There isn’t any mom who wants to hurt their kids,” she said. “They feel like they can’t manage without the cigarettes.”

According to the U.S. Centers of Disease Control and Prevention, 10 percent of women reported smoking during the last three months of pregnancy. Smoking during pregnancy has been connected a number of complications, including low birth weight, miscarriage, or premature birth."

Denise Huskins was found in Huntington Beach, California, Wednesday morning, police said. Her father, Mike Huskins, told ABC News that his daughter called him from Huntington Beach to say she was safe.

Vallejo police said that, through family members, Huskins had promised to speak with investigators but as of late Wednesday they were unable to contact her or her family. Police said she has since retained an attorney.

The FBI, which assisted Vallejo police in its investigation, had arranged for a jet to bring her from Huntington Beach to Northern California for the interview, said police.

""There is no evidence to support the claims that this was a stranger abduction or an abduction at all,"" read a statement from the Vallejo Police Department. ""Given the facts that have been presented thus far, this event appears to be an orchestrated event and not a kidnapping.""

Huskins, 29, was reported missing at 1:55 p.m. Monday by what police described as a 30-year-old man who called to report the alleged kidnapping and claimed he witnessed it. Police previously said that Huskins was abducted from the home where she was staying in Vallejo, California, hours earlier, at about 3:30 a.m.

The home from where Huskins was reportedly taken belongs to 30-year-old Aaron Quinn, ABC News has learned. Huskins' family describes him as her boyfriend and says he is the man who called 911 hours after her abduction. Park said the two were dating.

Park said that Quinn claimed whoever abducted Huskins made an $8,500 ransom demand.

The San Francisco Chronicle on Wednesday reported it received an email the day before from an ""anonymous person claiming to be holding Denise Huskins.""

The newspaper reported the email said that Huskins ""will be returned safely [Wednesday]"" and that ""any advance on us or our associates will create a dangerous situation for Denise.""

The e-mail was also reported to include an audio file of a woman identifying herself as Huskins who referred to Tuesday’s plane crash in southern France and identified the first concert she had attended in her life, the name of a childhood friend she attended the concert with, and the name of the friend's mother as proof of her identity.

“That was her. The tape recording was her. That I know. They said they were going to drop her off and they did,” Mike Huskins told the Chronicle after being played the audio recording. “I’m relieved. You have to expect the worst -- but in my heart, I knew she was still alive.""

Police in Vallejo said they received the same email and audio file but did not confirm its contents.

Vallejo police said in its statement that it would request either state or federal charges ""if evidence indicates that either Ms. Huskins or Mr. Quinn have committed a criminal act.""

""The Vallejo Police Department would like to ensure the public that there is no indication that this was a random act of violence,"" police said in its statement.

More than 40 detectives from the local, state, and police levels assisted in the investigation and search for Huskins, Park said.

“That is a tremendous amount of resources that in my opinion was wasted,” he said, adding that the search could be classified as a “wild goose chase.”

The investigation is ongoing and police are still trying to determine whether anyone else was involved, Park said."

A New York Police Department official identified one of those unaccounted for as Nicholas Figueroa, 23.

No information on the second person was immediately available.

At least 22 people were injured, four critically, after the fire in Manhattan's East Village, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said this afternoon. Earlier, city officials had said 25 were injured.

Figueroa's father, Nick Figueroa, told ABC News his son went to lunch in a restaurant at the bottom of the building that caught fire. He said he has had no contact with his son since the explosion and that investigators began searching for his son Thursday evening.

Neal Figueroa, Nicholas' brother, told ABC affiliate WABC this morning outside the Harlem apartment he shares with his brother that the family knows Nicholas Figueroa was at the Sushi Park restaurant because he has a pending charge for $13.04 at the establishment. The family last heard from him just before 2 p.m. ET, he said.

""Right now, we're just worried,"" he said.

Neal Figueroa said his brother was on a second date with a female co-worker that he hadn't yet met, but who he believed was in the hospital with numerous injuries following the explosion.

The family found out Nicholas Figueroa was missing when he didn't show up to work at Bowlmor Lanes at Chelsea Piers, he said. He was expected at 5 p.m. ET.

Neal Figueroa said the family has tried to locate Nicholas Figueroa through police, investigators and 311.

Neal Figueroa told WABC he was confident in his brother, referring to his brother as ""Superman.""

""I know he's strong enough to get out of this,"" he said.

It was unclear how many people were inside the building when the fire occurred, according to the New York City Fire Department. The incident took place in a bustling area with many restaurants and pedestrians, blocks away from New York University.

The FDNY confirmed that four buildings were affected and three buildings collapsed as a result of the fire and that firefighters were still putting water on some pockets of fire Friday morning. As of early this afternoon, firefighters had not started going through the rubble, city officials said.

""Once the debris is cleared and the fire is fully extinguished, then we will do a full investigation and clean-up,"" De Blasio said, adding that the full investigation ""take days.""

""Preliminary evidence suggests a gas-related explosion,"" DeBlasio said Thursday, adding that the investigation is ongoing. He said the incident ""appears to have been caused by plumbing and gas work that occurred in 121 2nd Avenue.""

De Blasio said today that it is rare to ""see a scene of such devastation in a city like this.""

""This was 24 hours ago a vibrant, bustling street,"" De Blasio said. ""And today, people are dealing with the aftermath of this tragedy.""

""The response by all of the first responders was exceptional,"" the mayor added, noting that the fire department arrived within minutes.

De Blasio said he saw ""great acts of kindness and bravery"" on Thursday, including an off-duty firefighter who climbed up a fire escaped and looked into apartments to see if anyone was home.

The four people in critical condition include two individuals with burns to their airways and another person who was unconscious following the event, according to FDNY Commissioner Daniel Nigro.

Of the about 250 firefighters who responded to the blaze, four were transported to area hospitals, where one was in fair condition, said the fire department. The conditions of the other firefighters weren't immediately released.

Around 3:17 p.m., witnesses reported what sounded like an explosion at Sushi Park restaurant at 121 2nd Avenue, which is at the bottom of a five-story, pre-war building that houses a handful of residential units."

The University of Oklahoma's chapter of SAE was closed earlier this month after the recording was released online. Two students were subsequently expelled from the school.

The university launched an investigation into the use of the chant, and school president David Boren announced today school officials had found that the 2011 cruise, an annual event, was the first known contact that their students had with the song.

""While there is no indication that the chant was part of the formal teaching of the national organization, it does appear that the chant was widely known and informally shared amongst members on the leadership cruise,"" Boren wrote in his letter.

It was then brought back to the school's chapter where it was shared with members and pledges for the past four years.

""Over time, the chant was formalized in the local SAE chapter and was taught to pledges as part of the formal and informal pledgeship process,"" the university's report states, going on to describe it as part of the ""institutionalized culture of the chapter.""

According to the SAE website, the 2011 cruise was scheduled to be held on a Royal Caribbean cruise ship over four days in August. The annual cruise departs out of Miami and, more than 700 undergraduates are expected to attend this summer's trip.

SAE executive director Blaine Ayers said that their larger investigation is underway and they will share the full results when it is complete.

""Our current findings at the University of Oklahoma are similar to those announced on Friday by University of Oklahoma President David Boren,"" Ayers said in a statement. ""But our investigation to date shows no evidence the song was widely shared across the broader organization."""

Officials are already monitoring 1,000 people in Arizona who were exposed to the contagious virus after seven people were found to be infected in the state.

“This is a critical point in this outbreak,” said Arizona Department of Health Services’ Director Will Humble. “If the public health system and medical community are able to identify every single susceptible case and get them into isolation, we have a chance of stopping this outbreak here.""

Measles is one of the most contagious viruses in existence and will infect an estimated 90 percent of unvaccinated people who are exposed to the virus. The incubation period is on average 14 days, but an infected person can be contagious up to four days before they start to show symptoms.

With scores of fans expected to head to Phoenix this weekend to watch the game between the New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks, health officials have delivered stern warnings to try and keep the disease from spreading in the state.

Anyone not vaccinated for measles is asked to stay out of public areas for 21 days. In Phoenix’s Maricopa County, the health department is asking unvaccinated children to stay home from school or day care for another three weeks in order to protect them from potential infection.

“If we miss any potential cases and some of them go to a congregate setting with numerous susceptible contacts, we could be in for a long and protracted outbreak,” said Humble on the health department website.

The current measles outbreak has infected at least 84 people in 14 states after originating in the Disneyland theme park, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control.

While immune globulin can be given to help mitigate symptoms, there is no way for health officials to stop those exposed from developing the disease. Symptoms of measles include fever, cough, runny nose and the tell-tale red rash, according to the CDC. In severe cases it can cause pneumonia, encephalitis or swelling of the brain and death.

This week, the health department detailed their health and public safety plans for the Super Bowl.

In addition to monitoring for dangerous pathogens and suspicious substances, the department will conduct “illness monitoring at urgent care centers, and monitoring poison control center calls related to Super Bowl events.”

The department said the enhanced surveillance will them to more quickly “identify health threats” and respond immediately."

Dr. Ghofran Ageely, a radiology resident at the King Abdulaziz University Hospital in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, told ABC News he was surprised the cartoon character looked so clear in the x-ray. The item the child swallowed, which appears to be some kind of tiny pendant, looked like a ""pin"" when he first saw it.

""I thought it is just a pin,"" Ageely said in an email. ""But when I opened the frontal view I was shocked to see SpongeBob looking at me with a big smile. Its angle and rotation are just perfect.""

Ageely said the tiny SpongeBob was safely removed from the 16-month-old child through a scope."

Aviation Safety Council Executive Director Thomas Wang, speaking at a news conference today, presented preliminary findings based on the flight-data recorders, which were recovered after the plane crashed in the Keelung River in Taipei. Wednesday’s crash killed at least 35 people, with eight still missing. Four bodies were recovered today, officials said.

Within a minute of takeoff, the plane's right engine triggered an alarm, Wang said. The data, however, showed it had not shut down, or ""flamed out,"" as the pilot told the control tower, but rather went into idle mode, with no change in the oil pressure, he added.

After that, the pilot apparently shut down the left engine, the only engine producing power, a maneuver that Wang said officials are continuing to investigate.

Steve Ganyard, a former Marine Corps fighter pilot and ABC News consultant, said ATR 72 twin-engine turboprop aircraft are designed to be able to fly with one powered engine.

“It sure seems like it was a crew coordination problem, that they misidentified the engine that was having problems and made the situation worse,” Ganyard said.

Once the engine is shut down, it can take about 30 seconds to get the engine restarted, but given the plane’s low altitude, there wasn’t enough time, Ganyard said.

Moments before the plane crashed, the pilot communicated with air traffic controllers for the final time: “Mayday, mayday, engine flameout,” the pilot said. The plane veered sharply, with the wing striking a vehicle and barrier before careening into the river.

Abe Sitzer contributed to this report from Taiwan, as well as The Associated Press.

At a routine dental cleaning on Jan. 28, the hygienist told Journee Woodard's mother that the whites of Journee's eyes looked yellow, and suggested taking her to a doctor -- just in case.

""I took her outside where there was more sunlight, and her eyes definitely looked yellow,"" Anna Woodard told ABC News. So she scheduled an appointment for the following Monday.

Three days and several medical tests later, Woodard picked Journee up from school to take her to the doctor for an MRI, trying to keep her calm and informed at the same time. Doctors had found a mass, and though they didn't say it at the time, Woodard said they later told her they were expecting cancer.

""I could tell Journee was getting nervous, especially when we checked into the hospital Thursday night,"" Woodard said. ""We assured her we weren't going to leave her side. And we stayed with her every night at the hospital from the time she was admitted until the time she was released.""

On Friday, Feb. 6, Journee underwent a 10-hour ""Whipple"" surgery to remove the tumor.

It wasn't cancerous, but Woodard said doctors told her the tumor would have ruptured had they not caught it. Had this happened while Journee was sleeping, she could have gone septic and never woken up, Woodard said. And it could have happened while Journee, who plays basketball, was on the court.

""It was one slide down the basketball court from rupturing,"" Woodard said. ""We were that close.""

Doctors originally thought the surgery would be three hours, but they wound up needing to remove part of Journee's liver, pancreas, small intestine and stomach, Woodard said. They also had to remove her entire gallbladder. Then, they ""rerouted everything,"" Woodard said.

The Whipple procedure is necessary because the pancreas is so ""integrated"" with other organs, according to the Mayo Clinic.

After spending a week recovering in the hospital, Journee got to return to her family's Edmond, Oklahoma, home on Thursday, but she's still hooked up to drains and intravenous lines, her mother said. She has IV nutrition and is unable to eat anything by mouth while her body recovers.

And while she's lost the tumor and pieces of several organs, she hasn't lost her sense of humor.

""I can still smell it!"" she shouts at her family as they hover in the kitchen eating breakfast where she can't see.

And though Journee couldn't play basketball on Saturday, she arrived to cheer on her team.

The Children's Hospital confirmed that Journee was a patient from Feb. 5 through Feb. 12, and that she underwent a Whipple procedure."

The ISIS fighters were killed as Iraqi forces repelled the attack, officials said, and no U.S. military service members were affected by the attack. A statement released by Combined Joint Task Force-Operation Inherent Resolve confirmed the attack.

“About 7:20 a.m. (Iraqi time, Friday, Feb. 13) a small Daesh element attacked an Iraqi Army facility on the Al Asad Air Base in Anbar province,” read the statement.

Pentagon spokesman Rear Admiral John Kirby said at a Pentagon briefing that between 20 and 25 ISIS fighters had tried to enter the base. Most, if not all, of the attackers were wearing Iraqi Army uniforms, he said.

The first wave of ISIS attackers detonated suicide vests at the base’s perimeter, Kirby said, and they were followed by a second wave of 10 to 15 fighters who tried to breach the perimeter.

“They were immediately engaged by members of the Iraqi army, the 7th Infantry of the Iraqi Army, and all were killed,” Kirby said, noting there were no Iraqi Army casualties in the incident, which he described as short in duration.

Kirby stressed that none of the 400 U.S. personnel on the base were anywhere near the attack. “At least a couple of miles away,” said Kirby. “So, they might have heard shots being fired, but that would've been about it.”

ISIS controls major parts of Anbar Province in western Iraq where al-Asad Airbase is located. The U.S. military is using the large 25-square-mile base as a training facility to train Iraqi troops and assist with Iraqi training of Sunni tribesmen to fight against ISIS.

For several months the base has been a frequent target of ISIS mortar fire, though U.S. military officials say it is ineffective because the fire is not targeted.

Kirby confirmed that on Thursday ISIS fighters had taken over al-Baghdadi, a town located less than 10 miles from the base at al-Asad. ISIS fighters who had been besieging the town for months were able to make into the town on Thursday and take over the local Iraqi police station.

The taking of al-Baghdadi was the first time in months that ISIS had gained ground in Iraq, where it has been in a defensive posture.

“It's one town. It's not all of al-Anbar. It's not all of Iraq,” said Kirby. “We need to keep it in perspective.”

U.S. officials said that Iraqi troops were making progress in clearing ISIS fighters at al-Baghdadi though Kirby said the town was still assessed to be under the control of ISIS."

The photos show the grown men doing silly things like squeezing into a bathtub, toy chest and cooler together.

The eldest brother, Matt MacMillan, posted the photos to Imgur and Reddit, where they went viral.

""We think it's odd that 2 million people have seen the three of us in a bathtub as fully grown men,"" MacMillan told ABC News today via email.

They decided to do the photo project after seeing other people do recreations and because his mother had asked for calendars for Christmas in the past, he said.

Their parents took ""tons of pictures"" of them as kids, so they had a lot to work with, Macmillan added.

""We took off work and school for a day, so we could take the pictures without our mom knowing,"" MacMillan said. ""We must have taken about 20 pictures of each scene trying to get the perfect facial expressions and poses.""

They also searched through half a dozen thrift stores to try to find the best clothes to match what they wore as kids, he said.

And it all paid off.

Mom ""loved it,"" MacMillan said. ""She couldn't stop laughing, and then the laughing turned to laugh-crying.""

She still texts him every week to tell him she's found something new in the pictures she didn't notice before, he said.

""I suppose I'd say we are momma's boys,"" MacMillan said. ""The youngest is definitely a momma's boy. We have a very close family."""

A cat in Florida that was hit by a car and then buried is apparently back from the dead.

""I was so shocked,"" owner Ellis Hutson told ABC News. ""I didn’t know really what to do.""

And today, Bart the cat is having surgery at the Humane Society to repair his jaw and remove his eye.

""We have seen many amazing cases at our full-service veterinary clinic, but this situation may take the cake,"" the Humane Society of Tampa said on its website.

The cat's owner, Hutson, 52, said he found Bart the cat two weeks ago in the middle of the road, lifeless in a puddle of blood.

Hutson said he asked his friend to help bury the 23-month old cat, because the landscaper was so distraught after losing a companion he's had since he was a kitten.

""We were so close, I couldn’t stand to bury him,"" Hutson said. ""I put him on the shoulder of the road and went and got David. He dug a hole and covered up the cat with dirt. I witnessed him bury the cat.""

Five days later, the cat showed up in a neighbor's yard alive, but weak, dehydrated and in need of medical attention.

""I open the door and my neighbor's standing there with the cat in her hand,"" Hutson said. ""She said, 'Bart is not dead.' I said, 'That’s impossible. We buried Bart.'""

Bart has been treated for a broken jaw, open facial wounds and a ruined eye. The Humane Society veterinarians expect him to recover and be able to return home after recovering a couple days.

""This is unbelievable. I don’t have any explanation for it,"" Hutson said.

Hutson said he will pay for the surgery costs for the cat. The total cost for the care of Bart, including today’s surgery and post-operative care, will be around $2,000, the Humane Society said.

Hutson's neighbor Dusty Albritton started a GoFundMe page to raise money for the cat’s medical expenses.

“I saw him with my own eyes. I know he was dead. He was cold and stiff,” Albritton told ABC News.

Albritton’s cat died the same day with similar injuries.

“We figured he was hit by the same car,” she said.

“Now my kids believe their cat will also rise from the dead,"" she said with a chuckle. ""But I told them I don't think so.""

When she discovered the resurrected Bart, she said he acted “like he’s in no pain whatsoever.”

1z3jNkv,2015-02-01 00:00:00,Super Bowl 2015: Facts and Figures Ahead of the Big Game - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/super-bowl-xlix-facts-figures-ahead-big-game/story?id=28482995,"Super Bowl XLIX between the New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks is later today. Here are some fun facts about the Big Game to chew on before kickoff.

-- The Seahawks and Patriots are both the No. 1 seed in their respective conferences.

-- The Seahawks are the first team to play in consecutive Super Bowls since the Patriots did it in 2004-05.

-- This is the 2nd time the University of Phoenix Stadium has held the Super Bowl. The stadium previously hosted Super Bowl XLII in 2008. The New York Giants defeated the Patriots 17-14 in what many regard as one of the best title games ever played and one of the NFL's biggest upsets. The Giants' win ended the Patriots perfect season that year.

-- The 2015 Pro Bowl on Jan. 25, 2015 was held at the University of Phoenix Stadium. It's the first Pro Bowl to be held at a Super Bowl site since 2010.

-- Which college is the best represented at this year's Super Bowl? The University of Wisconsin has the most with six players: James White and Jonathan Casillas of the Patriots and O'Brien Schofield, Russell Wilson, David Gilreath and Mike Taylor of the Seahawks.

-- The winning team will get to hoist the coveted Vince Lombardi Trophy, named after the legendary Green Bay Packers head coach and Brooklyn-native.

The sterling silver trophy is made by Tiffany & Co. and weighs about seven pounds.

-- Speaking of the Lombardi Trophy, the Pittsburgh Steelers have the most with six. The San Francisco 49ers and the Dallas Cowboys are tied for second with five each.

-- Other than Tom Brady's performance, the other most scrutinized aspect of the Super Bowl will be the commercials. A 30-second spot is estimated to cost between $4-4.5 million. For the first Super Bowl in 1967, the average cost of a 30-second ad was between $37,500 to $42,500.

-- Super Bowl XLVIII, which saw Seattle crush the Denver Broncos 43-8, was the most-watched Super Bowl of all time with 111.5 million viewers, according to Nielsen.

It also stands as the most-watched TV program is U.S. history.

-- The first Super Bowl in 1967 between the Green Bay Packers and the Kansas City Chiefs was watched by 51.1 million people, according to Nielsen. However, it was the only Super Bowl to be televised on two networks (CBS and NBC) simultaneously.

-- A ticket to any Super Bowl is arguably the most sought-after ticket in sports, but that wasn't always the case. The attendance for Super Bowl I was 61,946, but the seating capacity at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum was more than 94,000 at the time.

-- If winning the Super Bowl was not enough motivation, players on the winning team get paid $97,000.

And yes, even Super Bowl losers get a little extra cash with players on the losing team taking home $49,000.

The ad features a woman dialing 911 trying to order a pizza. The police dispatcher finally realizes the woman is in need of help -- only pretending to order because this is the only way she can dial 911.

During the call, chilling images of the inside of a wrecked home are shown.

The ad was created by the advocacy group NoMore.org.

The PSA follows a year where the NFL and Commissioner Roger Goodell came under fire for their handling of domestic violence issues, specifically the Ray Rice case.

Rice, 28, was terminated by the Baltimore Ravens last year following the release of a video showing him punching his then-fiancée (now wife) Janay Palmer. Rice appealed his indefinite suspension by the NFL, and won.

Rice, a former running back, is now a free agent and eligible to sign with any NFL team."

The plan could be delayed depending on training and equipment schedules for the Iraq troops that would be involved in the offensive, a U.S. Central Command official said, noting that ISIS is on the defensive and that the U.S. military plan against ISIS is “slightly ahead of the campaign.”

The official provided unusually detailed plans in a briefing for Pentagon reporters about the long-awaited push by Iraqi forces to retake Iraq’s second-largest city from the 1,000 to 2,000 ISIS fighters believed to there. The plans to launch an offensive in April or May are ahead of predictions made last October by U.S. Centcom officials that an offensive might not occur for another year.

As many as 12 Iraqi Army brigades or between 20,000 to 25,000 troops would be involved in retaking the city that was seized by ISIS in June, said the official.

An attack force of five Iraqi Army brigades or 10,000 troops would push into the city from the south with another three brigades making up a reserve force. Another three brigades of Kurdish Peshmerga forces “will help contain from the north and isolate from the west,” said the official.

A “Mosul fighting force” consisting mostly of former Mosul police officers and some tribal elements are currently being trained to provide stability operations after the main fighting has occurred, the U.S. military officials said. Another brigade of elite counter-terrorism forces will also be involved in the offensive.

“The five Iraqi brigades will all go through our training sites before we commence the operation on Mosul,” said the official. The U.S. has established five training sites for Iraqi and Kurdish brigades.

In coming weeks, the 3,200 Iraqi Army troops currently receiving training will replace the 10,000 troops that will be trained for the attack on Mosul, the official said. Training schedules may have to be adjusted to facilitate plans for an offensive in April or May.

U.S. military officials are typically reticent in providing details about the timing or force levels of planned military offensives. When asked why so many details about the planned offensive were being provided, the official said it was “to describe the level of detail that ISF are doing and the level of commitment that they have to this and the significance of this upcoming operation.”

But telegraphing details of the plan could also be an element of psychological warfare against ISIS given the numbers of Iraqi forces that would take on a much smaller force inside Mosul.

The U.S. and coalition airstrikes have taken such a toll on ISIS that they cannot regenerate the number of fighters being lost on the battlefield, the official said, noting that ISIS has sustained campaign losses in seven to eight months that are double what the U.S. has suffered in 14 years of combat in Iraq and Afghanistan. A combined 6,694 U.S. military service members have died in those conflicts.

“There is no organization in the world that can suffer those kinds of casualties and not have a tremendous impact on their ability to achieve their long term aims,” said the official, describing ISIS as being in a “zero-sum game” where it can no longer position forces without having to take them out of other fighting positions.

“They are losing ground in Iraq every day,” said the official, who noted that ISIS is in a defensive posture inside Iraq though small elements are still capable of conducting limited “micro-offensives,” as happened last week when ISIS took over the town of al-Baghdadi in Anbar Province.

Given that Gen. Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has said that American forward air controllers might be needed to call in airstrikes in complex operations like retaking Mosul, the official said a decision about whether to prepare American forward air controllers for such a mission would likely have to be made soon to accommodate the April-May timeframe.

Another key component of the ISIS strategy is the training of a force of 5,000 moderate Syrian rebels to fight ISIS inside Syria.

Pentagon Press Secretary Rear Admiral John Kirby said Wednesday that 1,200 potential trainees were being screened by U.S. Central Command and that training could begin as early as mid-March.

The Centcom official said the training will be conducted at four sites in the Middle East. A training facility in Jordan will be the first location to begin training, another training site in Turkey would begin operations soon. A third training site in Saudi Arabia could open within one to three months, while the fourth site in Qatar may not open for another six to nine months."

Kathryn Dickie, who lives on the 13th floor of The Torch in Dubai, told ABC News that the fire alarms began going off about 2 a.m. local time Saturday.

""The guards were pretty frantic,"" she said.

Dickie said residents believed the fire began near the 51st floor of the 1,100-foot-tall tower. She ran to a friend's apartment nearby, where they watched firefighters battle the blaze.

""You can actually see the flames being pushed out by the fire hoses,"" she said.

From her friend's apartment, Dickie saw flaming debris fall to the ground and continue smoldering. She estimated that there were at least ten fire trucks outside the tower, where about 2,000 people live.

Dickie, from Australia, said she has lived in Dubai for about one-and-a-half years, where she does business development for a law firm.

Dickie posted a video about 4:20 a.m. local time showing the fire going out. The blaze appeared to be extinguished a few hours after it began, reports The Associated Press.

Dubai's police chief, Maj. Gen. Khamis Mattar al-Muzeina, said that firefighters put out the blaze before it caused serious damage.

A number of people who suffered minor injuries were treated by ambulance crews at the tower, he said.

The cause of the fire was not immediately clear.

The tower was completed in 2011 and has 79 floors above ground.

Dubai, the largest city in the United Arab Emirates, population 9.3 million, is home to the tallest building in the world, the Burj Khalifa, which stands 2,716.5 feet tall and more than 160 stories, according to its website.

Craig Stephen Hicks, 46, was charged with three counts of first-degree murder and ordered held without bail Wednesday morning.

His wife, Karen Hicks, said she was shocked at the news of the event and that she believed the incident was not religiously motivated.

“We were married for seven years and that is one thing that I do know about him,"" Karen Hicks told reporters today. ""He often champions on his Facebook page for the rights of many individuals -- for same-sex marriages, abortion, race. He just believed -- I know that’s just one of the things I know about him is that everyone is just equal.”

Hicks' attorney Rob Maitland said his client had a ""longstanding issue"" with parking, saying, ""it has nothing to do with the religious faith"" of the victims.

“Unfortunately these victims were there at the wrong time at the wrong place,"" Maitland said.

""Our preliminary investigation indicates that the crime was motivated by an ongoing neighbor dispute over parking,"" Chapel Hill Police said in a statement. ""Hicks is cooperating with investigators and more information may be released at a later time.""

Police earlier said they were investigating whether the shooting was a hate crime. All three victims were Muslim.

Duke University’s Imam Abdullah Antepli said, “This may or may not be a hate crime,” adding that authorities have been “extremely helpful and supportive.”

U.S. Attorney in North Carolina Ripley Rand said, ""We don't have any information that this was a targeted campaign against Muslims in North Carolina.”

Two of the victims -- Deah Barakat, 23, a second-year student in UNC's School of Dentistry, and Yusor Mohammad, 21, a prospective dental student -- were married. Mohammad's sister, Razan Mohammad Abu-Salha, was a sophomore at North Carolina State University in Raleigh and was visiting her sister and brother-in-law, according to Deah Barakat's father.

Gunshots were reported after 5 p.m. Tuesday in the Finley Forest condominiums in Chapel Hill, east of the University of North Carolina campus.

Farris Barakat, Deah Barakat's brother, said Hicks had confronted his brother previously about a dispute over a parking space, adding that he never heard Hicks make any anti-Muslim remarks.

When Farris Barakat had visited his brother, Hicks had yelled at him, telling him he was parking in the wrong space, Farris Barakat told ABC News. Farris Barakat added that he tried to respond in a calm manner, not wanting to upset Hicks further, and said his brother also treated Hicks in a respectful manner.

Hicks showed up at Barakat and Mohammad's home in the past with a gun on his belt, and Mohammad had confided that she was afraid of Hicks, Farris Barakat said. The two joked that maybe she should get a gun, he added.

The nation's largest Muslim civil rights organization, The Council on American-Islamic Relations, requested law enforcement authorities address speculation about a possible bias motive in the homicide.

Information about the shooting was heavily shared on social media, fueling hashtags such as #MuslimLivesMatter and #ChapelHillShooting to trend across the United States."
1z88P8G,2015-02-03 00:00:00,"Selfies Likely Caused Colorado Plane Crash, NTSB Says - ABC News",http://abcnews.go.com/US/selfies-caused-colorado-plane-crash-ntsb/story?id=28688703,"A pilot taking selfies in the cockpit likely contributed to the crash of a small plane that killed him and his passenger last year near Denver, federal accident investigators concluded in a new report.

The National Transportation Safety Board released their full probable cause report about the May 31, 2014 crash and said that the evidence from the scene, including a GoPro camera with videos from recent flights, shows that the distraction of the pilot could have caused the crash.

The NTSB report about the Colorado crash describes the two-seat Cessna 150 taking off just after midnight on May 31, 2014, crashing about four minutes later. Family members identified the pilot as Amritpal Singh, 29.

Singh's family told ABC affiliate KMGH-TV that the other victim was a musician in town for a concert at a local high school, and that Singh was giving airplane rides to some of the people in town for the concert.

National Transportation Safety Board investigators said they found a GoPro camera near the wreckage. Though the GoPro did not record the crash itself, the report says the “recordings revealed that the pilot and various passengers were taking self-photographs with their cell phones and, during the night flight, using the camera’s flash function during the takeoff roll, initial climb, and flight in the traffic pattern.”

The NTSB report said investigators did not find anything wrong with the airplane itself, and say the evidence suggests the plane was not going fast enough to maintain lift before spinning out of control and crashing.

The report includes descriptions of seven videos recorded on the GoPro that was found near the wreckage and, even though they are believed to have been filmed in flights leading up to the crash but not that specific flight itself, the investigators believe the pilot could have been taking similar liberties in the air.

""Based on the evidence of cell phone use during low-altitude maneuvering, including the flight immediately before the accident flight, it is likely that cell phone use during the accident flight distracted the pilot and contributed to the development of spatial disorientation and subsequent loss of control,” the NTSB said.

The federal regulations surrounding cockpit photo use differs at various points throughout the flight.

""FAA regulations prohibit commercial pilots from using a personal wireless communications device or laptop computer for personal use while at their duty station on the flight deck while the aircraft is being operated,"" the agency said in a statement to ABC News when debates over Instagram photos started in December.

The FAA spokesperson went on to clarify that pilots are allowed to use cameras during the flight but not camera devices on cell phones."

A surveillance camera in the hospital lobby caught the dog entering through the automatic doors and wandering around.

The dog, named Sissy, belongs to Nancy Franck, 64, who has been at Mercy Medical Center for about two weeks following surgery. Her husband, Dale Franck, 66, had been taking care of Sissy and her brother Barney, also a miniature Schnauzer, back home.

“She was on a mission that night to see her mom,"" Dale Franck told ABC News today, ""but she couldn't find the right elevator to take.""

He said he noticed Sissy was missing around 1:30 a.m. this past Saturday, and he was worried sick.

""I kept checking everywhere, calling out, 'Sissy! Sissy!'"" he recalled. ""I was pulling my hair out.""

He finally got a call at 5:30 a.m. from security officer Samantha Conrad at the hospital, saying she had found his dog, he said.

""She found my number and house address from her tag on her collar,"" Dale Franck said. ""I was so relieved, and I asked my daughter go and pick her up.""

The security officer and the hospital did not immediately respond to ABC News' calls for comment.

Dale Franck's daughter got permission to take Sissy up to Nancy Franck for a few minutes, he said.

""She told her mom, 'I got a surprise for you!'"" Dale Franck said. ""My wife was like, 'How'd you get her in here? Did you sneak her under your coat?""

His daughter said that the ""little spoiled brat"" ran away from home because she wanted to see her mom, Dale Franck said, though it's unclear how the dog actually got there.

""Nancy and Sissy were able to love each other for a few minutes, and then she went back with me,"" Dale Franck said. ""She's my baby, and though it sounds funny now, it wasn't funny when she was missing. I was worried sick. I'm glad she's OK.""

He has one theory about how Sissy might have gotten 20 blocks to his wife.

""The only thing I could think of was that Sissy used to ride with me to pick up my wife from work next door to the hospital,"" Dale Franck said. ""But we've never walked that route before.""

Nancy Franck has been battling uterine cancer, and though doctors believe most of the cancer is gone, she is undergoing chemotherapy to make sure, Dale Franck said.

""She has a close relationship with Sissy,"" he added. ""Sissy's 11 now, and we bought her when she was just about 8 weeks old. She came up to me, scratched my leg and fell asleep on my shoulder. I'd say we didn't pick her, she picked us."""

The ISIS fighters were killed as Iraqi forces repelled the attack, officials said, and no U.S. military service members were affected by the attack. A statement released by Combined Joint Task Force-Operation Inherent Resolve confirmed the attack.

“About 7:20 a.m. (Iraqi time, Friday, Feb. 13) a small Daesh element attacked an Iraqi Army facility on the Al Asad Air Base in Anbar province,” read the statement.

Pentagon spokesman Rear Admiral John Kirby said at a Pentagon briefing that between 20 and 25 ISIS fighters had tried to enter the base. Most, if not all, of the attackers were wearing Iraqi Army uniforms, he said.

The first wave of ISIS attackers detonated suicide vests at the base’s perimeter, Kirby said, and they were followed by a second wave of 10 to 15 fighters who tried to breach the perimeter.

“They were immediately engaged by members of the Iraqi army, the 7th Infantry of the Iraqi Army, and all were killed,” Kirby said, noting there were no Iraqi Army casualties in the incident, which he described as short in duration.

Kirby stressed that none of the 400 U.S. personnel on the base were anywhere near the attack. “At least a couple of miles away,” said Kirby. “So, they might have heard shots being fired, but that would've been about it.”

ISIS controls major parts of Anbar Province in western Iraq where al-Asad Airbase is located. The U.S. military is using the large 25-square-mile base as a training facility to train Iraqi troops and assist with Iraqi training of Sunni tribesmen to fight against ISIS.

For several months the base has been a frequent target of ISIS mortar fire, though U.S. military officials say it is ineffective because the fire is not targeted.

Kirby confirmed that on Thursday ISIS fighters had taken over al-Baghdadi, a town located less than 10 miles from the base at al-Asad. ISIS fighters who had been besieging the town for months were able to make into the town on Thursday and take over the local Iraqi police station.

The taking of al-Baghdadi was the first time in months that ISIS had gained ground in Iraq, where it has been in a defensive posture.

“It's one town. It's not all of al-Anbar. It's not all of Iraq,” said Kirby. “We need to keep it in perspective.”

U.S. officials said that Iraqi troops were making progress in clearing ISIS fighters at al-Baghdadi though Kirby said the town was still assessed to be under the control of ISIS."

Two armed security security guards told police they were traveling from Miami to Attleboro, Massachusetts along I-95 and pulled over in eastern North Carolina after experiencing mechanical problems, according to the Wilson County Sheriff's Office.

The pair was approached by three armed men driving a white van who ordered the men onto the ground, tied their hands behind their backs and made them walk into the woods, police said.

During that time, the suspects allegedly took gold and silver estimated to be worth more than $4,000,000, police said.

The security guards worked for TransValue Inc., a Florida-based shipping security company that ships goods for companies and banks working within the precious metals industry. The company's CEO Jesus Rodriguez confirmed the robbery to ABC News and said that an internal investigation is underway.

Rodriguez told ABC News there is now a $50,000 reward for information that leads to an arrest or recovery of the stolen property.

The bacterium in question, burkholderia pseudomallei, is widespread throughout Southeast Asia and northern Australia, infecting humans and animals via contaminated soil and water entering the blood stream through cuts in the skin, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The high-security laboratory at the Tulane National Primate Research Center in Louisiana, which is studying the bacteria, reported that at least five rhesus macaques not used in studies were infected with the bug, possibly as early as November of last year, according to spokesman Michael Strecker.

How the bacteria made its way from the lab to animals not used in experiments is still an open question despite weeks of investigation by multiple federal and state agencies, including the CDC, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Environmental Protection Agency.

“The only connection among these four animals was their presence in the veterinary hospital during the same period of time,” Dr. Andrew A. Lackner, the director of the center, said in a statement last week, adding that more than 50 soil and water samples from the 500-acre compound have tested negative for the bacteria.

A federal investigator also tested positive for burkholderia, after visiting the center, Jason McDonald, a CDC spokesman, told ABC News. It isn't clear whether he was exposed to the bacteria at the primate center or during travel to an infected region, McDonald said.

However, Strecker said he did not believe the investigator came into contact with the germ at the center.

""At present there is no evidence of Burkholderia pseudomallei in any human or other non-human primate at the TNPRC,"" he told ABC News.

Though the CDC stressed that there is no risk to the general public, the agency said it has directed Tulane to suspend all research until the investigation is complete. The infected animals were euthanized, according to the Tulane statement.

“The veterinary hospital has been thoroughly disinfected, and additional animal testing is ongoing,” Lackner said in a statement. “Tulane continues to work with the CDC, USDA and the EPA, as well as state and local officials on this matter.”

Melioidosis causes fever, headache, loss of appetite, muscle and joint pain. Although full-blown illness from the bacteria is rare, the fatality rate is up to 50 percent in some countries for those who do get sick, studies show.

Abu Saad al-Dagestani was the nom de guerre of an ISIS terrorist shown in the gruesome Jan. 13 tape overseeing what ISIS claimed was the execution of two alleged ""Russian spies"" by a boy under 11. Al-Dagestani was first reported killed in jihadi tweets on Jan. 15, which claimed he was ""martyred"" near the embattled Kurdish town of Kobani on Syria's border with Turkey.

""We do think he was killed,"" a counter-terrorism official familiar with military operations around Kobani by the U.S.-led coalition told ABC News today.

The video, apparently produced by an ISIS media outlet and shared on Twitter, was seven minutes long and featured “confessions” by the two men. In a heavily-edited section, the boy, called a “lion’s cub,” was shown firing a pistol at the heads of the men, who each fall, apparently lifeless.

The boy appeared to have long hair and was dressed in black next to the adult overseeing him, al-Dagestani -- whose true identity is not known but was believed to be among many foreign fighters from Dagestan or Chechnya -- who wore a long beard, winter cap and carried both a pistol and a shoulder-slung rifle.

Officials declined to comment on the video's authenticity, but military sources and others said they suspected the executions were staged, noting the absence of bullet impacts and blood splatter. Another former counter-terrorism official, however, previously told ABC News the murders looks fairly real to him.

ISIS is well known for its sophisticated disinformation program, which is part of a highly-sophisticated media messaging committee that specializes in shocking western audiences with cinematic scenes of mass-decapitations and executions.

ISIS releases through its local affiliates in Syria and Iraq often multiple videos a day they produce depicting horrific executions for a variety of alleged violations of religious Shariah law or their own twisted rules. Most involve beheadings or amputating limbs in graphic bloodlettings.

Tweets announcing the death of al-Dagestani appeared on both ISIS-linked accounts as well as anti-ISIS Peshmerga accounts."

""We are currently investigating the events that led to the hospitalization of Bobbi Kristina,"" Christopher Brown of Brown & Rosen LLC, legal counsel for her father, Bobby Brown, told ABC News. ""To correct earlier reports, Bobbi Kristina is not and has never been married to Nick Gordon.”

Brown, 21, the daughter of singers Bobby Brown and Whitney Houston, is “fighting for her life"" after being discovered Saturday by Gordon and a friend face down in her tub in her Roswell, Georgia, home.

“We continue to request privacy in this matter,” according to a new statement from Bobby Brown. “Please allow for our family to deal with this matter and give Bobbi Kristina the love and support she needs at this time.”

After being found over the weekend, Brown was rushed to North Fulton Hospital in Roswell, where she had been treated, but has since been moved. It's unclear when or where she was moved to.

As for Gordon, the aspiring singer and actress has always been fiercely defensive of her relationship with the man Houston took into her home some years ago.

""I'm tired of hearing people say, 'Eww you're engaged to your brother or if Whitney was still alive would we be together or would she approve of this.' Let me clear up something. We aren't even real brother and sister, nor is he my adoptive brother,"" Brown wrote on Facebook before she claimed to tie the knot in 2013.

When Brown announced that she wed Gordon, she tweeted a picture of her hand on top of his, both sporting rings on that special finger.

""@nickdgordon! #HappilyMarried• SO#Inlove• if you didn't get it the first time that is,"" she captioned the pic. It also had a thumbs up sticker in the top left of the pic that read ""YERP,"" slang for yes.

With a vote of 99-0, the Senate approved the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act, which has already passed the House of Representatives and will now head to the president’s desk.

A 2013 study released by the Department of Veterans Affairs found that between 18 and 22 veterans commit suicide each day.

The bill will increase veterans’ access to mental healthcare, including creating a new website for veterans to obtain information about mental health services and forming a pilot community outreach program to help veterans as they transition from the battlefield to their homes.

The legislation also establishes a pilot loan repayment program for psychiatrists working at the VA.

The legislation was named after Clay Hunt, a Marine veteran who earned a Purple Heart after being struck in his wrist by a sniper’s bullet while serving in Anbar Province. After he was honorably discharged from the Marines in 2009, Hunt suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and became an advocate for fellow veterans. Hunt struggled with obtaining proper care through the VA and ultimately ended his own life in 2011.

“Despite his proactive and open approach to seeking care to address his injuries, the VA system did not adequately address his needs,” Susan Selke, Hunt’s mother, said at a Capitol Hill hearing last summer. “Not one more veteran should have to go through what Clay went through at the VA after returning home from war. Not one more parent should have to testify before a congressional committee to compel the VA to fulfill its responsibilities to those who have served and sacrificed.”

The Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of American have long lobbied for passage of the bill.

“This no nonsense bill not only will help save lives, but also honor the obligation the government made to our veterans when they put on the uniform. With its passage, our country can begin to curb the alarmingly high veteran suicide rate. And we can’t wait any longer as 22 veterans die by suicide every day,” IAVA CEO and Founder Paul Rieckhoff said Monday.

The sites shut down include some of the most important distributors of ISIS messages in a major escalation against ISIS’s propaganda and recruitment efforts, according to J.M. Berger, a terrorism analyst who monitors ISIS online messaging.

""Twitter has been doing a whole lot over the past week. They've slammed them pretty hard, including the official media distribution guys,"" Berger said. He said 13 of the 16 major ISIS distribution accounts were among those shut down.

Top U.S. security officials previously said ISIS has successfully leveraged social media networks, including Twitter, as powerful recruitment tools to draw in fighters from 90 countries. But a person with knowledge of Twitter’s recent suspension spree said it was not done due to U.S. government pressure -– in fact, he said the U.S. intelligence community would prefer the accounts stay open for intelligence gathering purposes.

Instead, the suspensions have been a result of increased media reporting, which in turn spurred public awareness, which has created more user-generated policy violation reports, the person said. It’s against Twitter’s policy, for instance, to make direct, specific threats of violence against others.

The assault on ISIS social media was followed by an apparent threat Monday by supporters of the Syria-based network responsible for killing thousands of innocents while establishing an Islamic ""caliphate"" from Syria to Iraq and elsewhere. The message posted online called out Twitter founder Jack Dorsey by name and used his photo.

The Twitter spokesperson would only say that the company's security team was ""investigating the veracity of these threats with relevant law enforcement officials,"" and that content is constantly reviewed against Twitter's rules.

""I would certainly be concerned if I were Twitter,"" said Berger, co-author with Jessica Stern of ""ISIS: The State of Terror,"" set for release next week.

A counter-terrorism official told ABC News that the U.S. was looking into the threat and that for months ISIS's ability to distribute its daily dose of beheading and murder videos has been ""challenged."" Some airstrikes by the U.S.-led coalition in Iraq and Syria have targeted the ISIS media team, which analysts have assessed has limited the core leadership from releasing more than a handful of slick videos since September."

The shortcomings prompted concerns within the Department of Homeland Security that the boutique immigration program would be exploited by terrorists, according to internal documents obtained by ABC News.

“It is shocking,” said Sen. Charles Grassley, an Iowa Republican. “Particularly when you have F.B.I. and other law enforcement agencies that are saying national security could be compromised or is being compromised -- that's enough for us to be concerned.”

WATCH full report on ""Nightline"".

Following publication of this report, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said today he is “aware of the concerns” raised by ABC News “centering around security” and said the DHS “continually evaluate[s] whether more security should be provided for the program.”

Some immigration groups have criticized the program as “nothing more than selling Green Cards.” Brent Wilkes, the executive director of the League of United Latin American Citizens, one of the largest Hispanic civil rights groups in the U.S. said it “short circuits” the immigration process, allowing foreign nationals “with enough cash” to leap ahead of legitimate applicants who lack the means.

Supporters call the program a “win-win” because as the investors accelerate through the immigration process, their overseas money helps spur job-creating projects in the U.S.

“The American worker [is] able to get to work thanks to the capital investment coming through the program,” said Peter Joseph, the executive director of the Association to Invest in the U.S.A., a Washington, D.C. group that has advocated for the little-known immigration program.

But an ABC News investigation found that in addition to reaching wealthy foreign investors, the program has become a magnet for those seeking to sidestep the scrutiny of the traditional immigration process. In one case, immigration officials pushed through a visa application from Chinese investor in a Las Vegas hotel project despite an internal review that found the investor had previously been turned back at the border, and much of his visa application had likely been fabricated, immigration records show."

Boston Police released photographs on social media of the man as he stoically shoveled snow from the route on Boylston Street. Using the hashtag #WhoShoveledTheFinishLine, Boston Police asked the public to help solve the mystery of the hardy soul.

Laudani, an avid runner, said he left his bartender shift at Back Bay Social at 3:30 p.m. on Tuesday and helped his coworkers shovel the snow form around the bar, after which he decided to continue shoveling in another spot.

He said he ran the Boston Marathon in 2011.

The Boston Marathon finish line is his ""favorite place in the entire city,"" he said. ""It doesn't deserve to be covered in snow because it in a symbol of Boston and our community.""

Laudani said he was shocked by all the media attention and doesn't want to be hailed as a hero. He said he ""wanted to do a good deed for the community because I love Boston.""

It took him about 20 minutes to shovel the line, after which he went back to the bar, dropped off his manager's shovel, and went home, he said. It wasn't until today that he realized that someone took a photo and people wanted to talk to him.

The finish line has special significance as the site of the twin bombings at the Boston Marathon that killed three people on April 15, 2013.

But becoming the healthiest version of yourself also means throwing away the stuff that's holding you back—and we don't only mean junk food. Get your recycling or garbage can ready!

Go through your collection of food-storage containers and toss anything made of clear, rigid plastic, and stamped with a 7 or “pc” (stands for polycarbonate). “These are the types of containers that may contain BPA,” says Sonya Lunder, MPH, a senior analyst at the Environmental Working Group, who also advises tossing warped or cracked containers. While manufacturers have take BPA out of many of the newer polycarbonate containers, old ones still probably have it. And multiple trips through the dishwasher can up leeching of the chemical. Lunder also cautions against heating any type of plastic in the microwave because of chemical-leeching concerns. “Glass is safer in general,” she says.

20 Quick and Easy Ways to Get Healthier Fast

Though some companies have recently announced they're phasing out phthalates, which are used to help fragrance linger longer, many air fresheners (solids, sprays, and plug-ins) still contain this type of chemical, which in large doses may have harmful effects on reproduction or development. “These products are simply chemical perfumes that you put in the air,” says Lunder, who argues that it's much healthier to take care of the root cause of a smell than mask it with chemicals.

12 Strange-But-True Health Tricks

Antibacterial soap is no more effective at killing bacteria than the regular stuff—and they may not be safe, according to a 2014 FDA report. Triclosan, the active ingredient in antibacterial cleansers, has been shown to alter hormone regulation in animals, and there's also concern that the chemical may contribute to antibiotic resistance.

If you haven't already, you may want to reconsider your diet soda habit—especially if you're trying to lose weight. A much-buzzed-about study published in the journal Nature found that non-caloric sweeteners such as saccharin (Sweet-n-Low), sucralose (Splenda), and aspartame (Equal) may mess with the gut bacteria that play a key role in healthy metabolism. Researchers found a link between these sweeteners, altered gut microbes, glucose intolerance and metabolic syndrome (both precursors to Type 2 diabetes) in mice and humans.

10 Reasons to Give Up Diet Soda

Most running shoes should be replaced every 300 to 400 miles, says Jason Karp, MD, exercise physiologist and author of Running for Women. For a runner who logs 30 miles a week, that's about every three months. When shoes wear down, they lose their cushioning and are less capable of absorbing the impact of your foot landing with each step, so more force is transmitted to muscles, bones, and tendons, putting you at risk for injuries, he explains. If you're not a runner, replace them about every six months, or as soon as you notice that the tread is looking worn out.

If you're brushing in the morning and the evening like you're supposed to, then your toothbrush bristles are probably becoming frayed and worn faster than you realize. “In my experience, bristles start to fray after about two months of use, so I recommend my patients replace their brushes every three months,” says American Dental Association spokesperson Ruchi Sahota, who is a practicing dentist in California. Worn-out brushes are less effective at cleaning teeth and fighting off decay.

“In the end, we are what we think about, and what we think about is heavily influenced by what we keep around us,” says motivational speaker and life coach Gail Blanke, author of Throw Out Fifty Things. She calls the things that neither serve a specific purpose nor exist to make you feel good ""life plaque"": “The more life plaque we pile around ourselves, the less we can focus on what we really care about,” she explains. Not sure where to start? Toss things that annoy you every time you see them, like socks that have lost their match, or your overflowing kitchen junk drawer. No matter what you decide to throw out (or donate), your goal is to whittle the physical objects down to only items that help you feel energized and accomplish your goals.

Take a peek in your closet. How many items have you not worn within the last year? Many people who've lost weight keep the bigger sizes around in case they regain it, while others hold onto the size 2 jeans they wore in high school, thinking maybe if they diet they'll fit again. In either case, seeing these items every day can bring on anxiety. That's not how anyone wants to feel when getting ready.

When it comes to highly perishable food that contains animal ingredients, the rule of thumb is to eat, toss, or freeze after three days, says Michael P. Doyle, PhD, director of the Center for Food Safety at the University of Georgia. “Listeria is linked to scary things like meningitis, miscarriages, and even death,"" he says. ""It can grow to millions at refrigerator temperatures in under a week.""

Cory Batey was convicted along with Brandon Vandenburg Jan. 27 of aggravated rape and aggravated sexual battery in a dorm room attack, which prosecutors said Vandenburg recorded on a cellphone. Batey and Vandenberg could face decades in prison when they’re sentenced in March.

“I was drunk out of my mind,” Batey said in a clip from the exclusive interview from the Nashville Criminal Justice Center, which airs Monday. “I just couldn’t believe it was me.”

One of the toughest exchanges in the interview involves Batey’s testimony about the moment he says he realized something horrible happened the night of June 23, 2013. In court, Batey referred to the victim as “the young lady in the pictures” and attempted to apologize, but he used different language to describe her in a text message after the assault.

“I don’t recall who that was,” Batey responded.

“It’s an interesting choice of words, ‘Some b****.’ Because you’re saying, ‘That’s not me. I – I watch myself on tape, that’s not me. That’s out of character,’” McGraw said.

“Yes, sir,” Batey said.

During the trial, Batey testified he was too drunk to remember the incident, claiming he blacked out after consuming between 14 and 22 drinks that night. He told the court he didn't realize what he had done until the next morning, after finding graphic photos on his phone as he was on his way to church.

Authorities say Batey and co-defendant Vandenburg, along with two other men, carried the victim – who is not being identified by ABC News – to a dorm room, where the unconscious student was assaulted. Two other ex-players accused of being involved in the incident, Brandon Banks and Jaborian McKenzie, also face charges of rape and sexual battery, but have not yet gone to trial. Banks and McKenzie have pleaded not guilty."

The USDA approval allows trees bearing the new fruit to be sold to farmers, but safety approval by the Food and Drug Administration for consumption can't be far behind, according to Patty Lovera, assistant director of Food and Water Watch, a consumer-rights group based in Washington, D.C. She said it will probably still be a few years before they're sold in stores.

The scientists behind the so-called Arctic apples ""turned off"" the gene found in apples that caused them to turn brown -- a process that differs from other GMO crops and foods, which usually add genes from other organisms. For instance, the GMO salmon from AquaBounty Technologies is an Atlantic salmon with an added Pacific salmon gene to make it grow faster and an added eel gene to make it grow year-round.

""This time, they're going into the existing material and turning off genes, but what else did that gene do that they turned off?"" Lovera asked, pointing to the concerns that some people have about the potential unintended consequences of manipulating genes.

For example, if that gene helped protect the apple from pests, and it's no longer ""on,"" farmers could need more pesticides, she said. Her other concern, she said, is that now consumers won't know how long apples have been sitting out.

Dietitian Amy Jamieson-Petonic, of University Hospitals Case Medical Center in Cleveland, Ohio, said research suggests genetically modified foods don't pose an immediate threat to people's health. But there's always room for more research, she said.

Apples that have turned brown, or oxidized, aren't nutritionally different from apples that have not yet turned brown, she said, but she recommends eating apples before that happens. If you don't want apples to turn brown, squeeze a little lemon juice on them, she said. The vitamin C keeps the fruit from oxidizing.

Okanagan Specialty Fruits, which makes the Arctic apples, said in a statement that it was excited by the USDA approval and it is ""working hard to get as many trees in the ground as possible so that you’ll be able to purchase Arctic apples in stores within the next few years.""

""The supply-chain can feel confident knowing that Arctic apples are likely the most tested apples in existence,"" the company said. ""Rigorously reviewed by multiple regulatory bodies, all evaluations reach the same conclusion -- Arctic apples present no unique risks and are just as safe and healthful as any other apple."""

The storm brought 23 inches of snow to Boston, making it the seventh-largest snowfall total ever recorded in the city.

Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker gave another day off to non-emergency state workers who live in the hardest hit areas of the state and the mayor of Boston said schools would remain closed for another day. The storm on top of two others that hit recently has shattered snowfall records for a 30-day period in the city.

February is now officially the city's snowiest month on record, beating the snowfall in 1978, the mayor said. There are now upwards of 6 feet of cumulative snow in some parts of the area, which could still receive more by the end of Tuesday, he added.

The latest onslaught forced the cancellations of hundreds of flights, tested transit systems and tempers and collapsed roofs straining beneath the weight of 5 feet or more of snow in less than two weeks.

Boston and areas south were hardest hit, with the National Weather Service reporting unofficial measurements of 26.5 inches in Weymouth, 26 inches in Sharon and 24.9 inches in Norwell. Forecasters expected more than 20 inches on the ground in Boston before the storm winds down early Tuesday.

To make matters worse, forecasters said more snow was possible on Thursday.

The professional climber, 47, scaled a frozen section of the waterfall Tuesday, clinging to a wall of solid ice. He was close enough to feel the spray of the pounding water feet away. Sarah Hueniken also participated in the climb.

Stunning video from the climb shows Gadd using two ice picks, along with strength and guile -- calculating every move, the terrain unsteady and unpredictable. During the climb, giant chunks of ice fell just past Gadd’s head, and 150,000 tons of water flowed next to him every minute, racing past at nearly 70 miles per hour.

Lots of preparation went into the climb. He scouted the area months ago, long before the ice formed, and also worked with parks officials to receive the necessary permits.

“I’ve been lucky enough to climb all over the world. I got to climb ice on top of the roof of Africa, the highest point of Mount Kilimanjaro. But this climb was Niagara Falls. This is the coolest waterfall in the world,” Gadd said.

But what happens when a particular illness makes it impossible to go on an expedition?

For Levi Mayhew, a 6-year-old from Martinsville, Indiana, battling a rare congenital disorder that prevents him from traveling, the next best thing to going away himself was to send his best friend somewhere sunny.

""Levi's most heartfelt wish was to give his best friend Emma a trip to Florida to visit the theme parks and see the ocean,"" a representative for Make-A-Wish America told ABC News.

Emma Broyer, 10, is described by Make-A-Wish as having ""provided tremendous support for Levi during his medical struggles."" The buddies spend a lot of time together, and Mayhew wished to send Emma on the trip of a lifetime.

Upon learning that they would be traveling to Orlando, Florida, the Broyer family decided to bring along a ""Flat Levi,"" a cardboard cutout with Levi's face glued to the head, making sure to include him in photos of their adventures.

“With all that we have been through with all of this, the best gift we have been given is Levi and his family added to our family,"" said Emma's mother, Shawnelle Broyer. ""God has brought us all together and we are so thankful that we have them in our lives.”

Her daughter echoed that sentiment, telling strangers who asked about the cutout in Orlando that Levi was her best friend from school.

“It was the best experience of my life,” Emma Broyer said.

At a welcome home party, the Broyer family surprised Levi and his parents with a scrapbook of ""Emma and Levi's Trip.""

""Levi is such a happy kid,"" said Levi's mother, Rebecca Drake. ""He loves people. Seeing his happy face on the Flat Levi means so much to us. We know that would be his reaction to everything that has happened with Make-A-Wish.”

In particular, several counter-terrorism officials expressed deep concern about ISIS asserting itself in Libya, where the U.S. is still reeling from the Sept. 11, 2012 attack on a diplomatic post in Benghazi that killed four Americans, including the U.S. Ambassador to Libya.

""They pretty much own Libya,"" a second official involved in counter-terrorism operations said. ""We have zero collection there and zero authorities there.""

The first official referred to aspirational ISIS-produced maps showing their black jihadi flag representing the caliphate -- which was declared last summer by ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi -- enveloping much of the Middle East, Europe and North Africa and obliterating traditional borders. Their broad ambition is being realized in certain areas, the official said.

""Some of that territory they're actually legitimately claiming now,"" the official said.

""They've been preparing this for a while. A lot of them fought with ISIS in Syria and they're coming back home to Libya,"" Aaron Zelin, an expert on ISIS at the Washington Institute for Near-East Policy, told ABC News.

The group has used a tactic of distracting the West with individual hostage dramas – like the recent one that ended in the death of a Japanese journalist, a Japanese adventurer and a Jordanian F-16 pilot – while carrying out a far more shadowy campaign of expansion, expert observers told ABC News.

Last month, while the world was riveted by ultimately doomed negotiations for the release of the Japanese citizens and the pilot, ISIS’s division in Libya perpetrated a deadly suicide attack against Tripoli's Corinthia Hotel, which killed a dozen people including decorated U.S. Marine Corps veteran David Berry, who was working as a contractor.

""Those guys are good, that's true,"" a senior intelligence official said, referring to their regional strategy intertwined with sophisticated public messaging campaigns.

For several months, ISIS besieging the strategically-insignificant town of Kobane in Syria garnered considerable global attention even as ISIS essentially overran much of Iraq's Anbar province west of Baghdad and made barely-noticed inroads within Libya, the Sinai and Yemen.

The U.S.-led coalition, working with Kurdish peshmerga ground spotters, killed at least 1,500 ISIS fighters with airstrikes in and around Kobane, a defense official told ABC News last week. ISIS ultimately lost the fight for Kobani and lost ground in some areas north of Baghdad near Baiji and in Diyala province. But they also have managed their own expectations and effected tactical withdrawals like disciplined military forces, defense officials have said.

Since ISIS announced in November it had accepted a pledge of loyalty from a group it set up in Libya, the affiliate there has released about a dozen communiques in the model of its parent organization announcing beheadings to enforce religious Shariah law, assassinations, the kidnappings of 21 Christian ""crusaders"" and the Corinthia Hotel attack. But to date the Libyan affiliate has not commanded the spotlight the way core-ISIS has in Iraq and Syria.

However, in the foreseeable future Libya has the ""most potential"" for ISIS to duplicate its success in Iraq, Zelin said.

""They're trying to build up their capability in Libya and then they'll probably go after insurgent factions there like they did in Syria,"" he added. From there, ISIS will try to make its disturbing map of an expanded “caliphate” a reality.

Zelin argued that as ISIS has expanded its reach outside its traditional areas of control, it has avoided the past mistakes of al Qaeda, which anointed franchises to assist in its goal of attacking the west.

That plan faltered with its onetime Iraqi affiliate headed by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, who led the predecessor organization of ISIS and started a sectarian war -- which core-al Qaeda didn't desire -- between Iraq's Sunni and Shi'a Muslims. Instead, ISIS has opted to enlarge its self-proclaimed Muslim caliphate while putting attacking the west as a much lower strategic priority.

“It's all very ambitious. But the impossible hasn't stopped them in the past,"" Zelin said."
1zG4lXr,2015-03-04 00:00:00,'Free Range' Parents Found Responsible for Child Neglect After Allowing Kids to Walk Home Alone - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/free-range-parents-found-responsible-child-neglect-allowing/story?id=29363859,"A Maryland couple who was being investigated for allowing their two children to walk home alone from a neighborhood park have been ""found responsible for unsubstantiated child neglect"" by the state's Child Protective Services.

Maryland Child Protective Services began investigating Danielle and Alexander Meitiv of Silver Spring, Maryland, for practicing so-called “free-range parenting,” a philosophy that encourages children to have some independence.

In the Meitivs' case, this means they allow their two children, Rafi and Dvora, ages 10 and 6, to play outside and walk home by themselves.

The couple told “Nightline” in an email today that they found out the results of the CPS investigation last week.

“We are shocked and outraged that we have been deemed negligent for granting our children the simple freedom to play outdoors. We fully intend to appeal,” Danielle Meitiv said via email. “We also have no intention of changing our parenting approach.”

The Meitivs told “Nightline” in an interview that aired in January that they trust their children and want to give them the freedom to make mistakes, away from the parental safety net.

“I'm just parenting the way I was parented and the way that almost every adult I know was parented,” Danielle told “Nightline” at the time.

But that all changed after the Montgomery County Police stopped the kids in December as they were walking home from a park without an adult and gave them a stern warning.

Maryland Child Protective Services then accused the Meitivs of neglect, saying unless they committed to a safety plan, the kids would have to go into foster homes. In Silver Spring, leaving anyone under age 18 unsupervised constitutes neglect.

Suddenly this middle-class suburban family found themselves smack in the middle of a national parenting debate.

When asked for comment, Maryland Child Protective Services referred the case to the Maryland State Department of Human Resources.

A Maryland State Department of Human Resources spokeswoman said that confidentiality laws prohibits them from commenting on any specific case, and would only say that the ruling would serve as ""a point of reference that will be used in any future decision.""

No criminal charges have been filed.

The Meitivs stand by their belief that they are the best ones to judge if their kids are ready, and if their neighborhood is safe enough, for them to be on their own, not the government.

“Frankly I think that raising independent children and responsible children and giving them the freedom that i enjoyed is a risk worth taking,” Danielle Meitiv told “Nightline” in a previous interview. “In the end it's our decision as parents.”"

Mardjono SiswoSumarno, chief investigator at the National Transportation Safety Committee, said the cockpit voice recording indicated that the co-pilot, French national Remi Emmanuel Plesel, was flying the plane while Indonesian Capt. Iriyanto was monitoring.

Iriyanto, who uses one name, was a former fighter pilot with more than 20,500 flying hours, while the less-experienced Plesel had about 6,000 hours.

Radar data showed the plane was climbing at an abnormally high rate -- 3,000 feet in 30 seconds -- prior to the crash, before stalling and plunging into the Java Sea, authorities have said.

More than 70 victims’ bodies have been recovered from the wreckage of AirAsia Flight 8501. Earlier this week, Indonesia’s military halted its recovery efforts, including attempts to locate more bodies and raise the fuselage from the sea.

The Indonesian Search and Rescue Agency, however, is continuing to look for victims with its own ships and helicopters.

A spokesperson for the U.S. attorney’s office and the FBI declined to comment and authorities said no decision has been made on whether to eventually bring charges while prosecutors concentrate on the trial of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, Russell’s brother-in-law.

Katherine Russell, who was married to Tamerlan Tsarnaev, is suspected of being the woman who accompanied Tsarnaev to a Macy’s in Boston two months before the April 2013 attack where he bought five pressure cookers – two of which were allegedly used to make the bombs placed at the marathon finish line. In an affidavit to search the Tsarnaev’s home, FBI agents said they were looking for clothing consistent with those seen on a security video at Macy’s.

A few weeks earlier Tamerlan Tsarnaev had gone to a fireworks store in New Hampshire and bought 48 mortar shells, also used in the bombs. At the fireworks store, Tamerlan had asked for the “biggest and loudest” fireworks available and spent roughly $200, according to court documents.

“To live in a small apartment and buy five pressure cookers and have all those explosives obviously just does not make sense – something other than cooking was going on,” said former FBI special agent and ABC News consultant Brad Garrett.

Lawyers for Russell and federal prosecutors initially declined to answer ABC News questions about Russell’s status, but a senior law enforcement official said she could face charges of misprision of a felony, or failing to notify authorities of a crime about to happen.

Following Tuesday’s ABC News report on Russell, an attorney for Russell, Joshua Dratel, said in a written statement to ABC News, “There is no video of Ms. Russell at a Macy’s in connection with the purchase of pressure cookers, and any claim that there is such a video, or any claim remotely approaching that, is false. Also false is any allegation that Ms. Russell was involved in the purchase of any pressure cookers, or that she accompanied her late husband with respect to any such purchase by him.”

Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed in a police shootout three days after prosecutors say he and his younger brother, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, detonated twin bombs near the finish line of the Boston Marathon, killing three people – including an eight-year-old boy – and injuring some 260 others.

Days after Tamerlan was identified as one of the suspected bombers, another of Russell’s attorneys at the time, released a statement saying Russell was assisting the investigation into the bombing and was not aware of the plot beforehand.

“As a mother, a sister, a daughter, a wife, Katie deeply mourns the pain and loss to innocent victims, students, law enforcement officers, families and our community,” the attorney, Miriam Weizenbaum, said then.

Shortly after the bombing, Russell left her family and moved to New Jersey to live with Tsarnaev’s two sisters. She later moved out of her sister-in-law’s apartment and was last seen in a transitional housing facility for the homeless in New Jersey, according to authorities briefed on the investigation. Authorities told ABC News the FBI put Russell under surveillance during last year’s Boston Marathon race.

Opening statements in the murder trial of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev are set to begin Wednesday morning. Russell is not expected to be called as a witness for the government.

But money isn't on his mind.

He wants to make sure it never happens again.

""Mentally challenged individuals have just as many rights as other people,"" Joseph Camacho, 79, told ABC News. ""Most of the time, they [hospitals] just seem to ignore them and treat them like prisoners instead of a patient.""

His son, Dean Camacho, who was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, was attacked at Pacifica Hospital of the Valley in Sun Valley, California, by his roommate, Jerry Romansky in 2011, according to court documents. The hospital put the two men in the same room of the hospital's behavioral health unit despite Romansky's violent history, and didn't check on them every 15 minutes as they were supposed to, according to the plaintiff's trial brief. Romansky was hearing voices that told him to ""kill himself and others,"" according to the brief, and he had tried to strangle a previous roommate at Pacifica with a towel, it said.

Though rooms throughout the hospital were equipped with emergency buzzers, they had been disabled in the mental health wing, according to Joseph Camacho's lawyer, John Marcin.

Romansky, whose father testified against the hospital as well, stabbed Camacho with a metal bracket that he broke off from a toilet in the room, severing one of Camacho's arteries and causing him to bleed to death, Marcin said.

He said the hospital's deficiencies had mostly not changed in the more than three years since the murder.

""I think that's why the jury became so angry,"" Marcin said. ""I asked the jury for $2 million in punitive damages, and they came back and awarded 3 [million dollars], they were so angry.""

The jury awarded $5.2 million in damages in all.

""It gives you a good feeling that you're all on the same page,"" Camacho said. ""The hospital wasn't.""

Joseph Camacho and Romansky's father had a connection in a way because they each lost a son, Joseph Camacho said. Dean Camacho died, and Romansky is serving a prison sentence as a result of Camacho's murder. They'd both been wronged by the hospital, he said.

Pacifica Hospital of the Valley did not respond to ABC News' request for comment.

The hospital's lawyer, Vincent D'Angelo, told ABC News that the hospital has not yet decided whether to appeal, but that hospital officials are sorry for Camacho's loss.

Another lawyer for one of the doctors who settled out of court argued that the doctor had no knowledge Romansky would become violent and kill Camacho, and that the two men did not have any prior conflict, according to the defense brief."

Danish police shot and killed the 22-year-old man early today in a shootout with police in the Noerrebro district of Copenhagen, Danish investigator Joergen Skov told The Associated Press.

He was believed to be responsible for shootings at a free speech event and a synagogue in Copenhagen that officials said were likely inspired by last month's terror attacks in Paris.

According to Copenhagen police, at about 5 a.m., the suspect was returning to an address that was under police surveillance. When officers tried to make contact with the suspect, he shot at them. The officers returned fire, killing him.

Police said they had found an automatic weapon that may have been the one used in the attack at the free speech event, according to the AP.

""Nothing at this point suggests there were other perpetrators"" in the Saturday shootings, Skov said. Police officials said at a news conference Sunday that they knew who the suspect was but have not yet released his identity, only saying he was from Copenhagen.

The first shooting happened about 4 p.m. Saturday at an event titled ""Art, Blasphemy and Freedom of Expression,"" organized by Swedish artist Lars Vilks, who has faced several threats after caricaturing the Prophet Muhammad.

Vilks told Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet that he ""heard some shots. They sounded weak so I didn't think they sounded as gun shots. It was very surreal.""

""I'm not sure how many shots but I'd say about 20 or 30 shots,"" Dennis Myhoff-Brink, who witnessed the attack, told BBC News. ""People panicked of course and ran to the doors. Other people were hiding behind tables they had turned over.""

The 55-year-old victim in that shooting has been identified as filmmaker Finn Noergaard, a man who produced and directed documentaries for Danish television, according to the AP.

Vilks, 68, who was not injured in the shooting, said he believes he was the intended target.

""What other motive could there be? It's possible it was inspired by Charlie Hebdo,"" he told the AP.

""This is not unexpected ... not going to be the last time either,"" Vilks told Swedish newspaper ""Aftonbladet."" ""It could have been a massacre, what if the suspect would have gotten inside the venue... Of course this is a tragedy but it was expected. It would have happened sooner or later.""

""Denmark has been hit by terror,"" Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt said, according to the AP. ""We do not know the motive for the alleged perpetrator's actions, but we know that there are forces that want to hurt Denmark. They want to rebuke our freedom of speech.""

The shooting happened a month after gunmen opened fire on the Charlie Hebdo satirical magazine in Paris, killing 12 people. The magazine had published cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad, angering many Muslims.

In the days that followed, a police officer was killed and four others slain at a kosher grocery store inside the French capital.

Hours after the shooting at the cafe, police said Dan Uzan, a 37-year-old member of Copenhagen's Jewish community, was killed and two police officers were wounded in a shooting outside a synagogue.

Uzan was standing near the entrance when he was shot, acting as a security guard for a Bat Mitzvah party that was taking place inside, according to Copenhagen's main synagogue.

""It is a very sad morning where we all think of the victims and their relatives,"" Thornin-Schmidt said. ""Two innocent people have lost their lives because of a cynical terror action against Denmark.""

House Intelligence Committee ranking member Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., told ABC News that it's ""too early to tell"" if the shootings in Copenhagen were tied to ISIS or al Qaeda.

""We still don't know. Obviously they [the intelligence community] are working with Danish authorities to try to get to the bottom of -- was there an affiliation with al Qaeda or ISIS? Was this self-radicalization? Was this a copycat of what happened in Paris?"" Schiff said. ""It's still too early to tell.""

“In this deadly 'Game of Thrones,' there is no place for America or for Israel. No place for Christians, Jews or Muslims,"" he said. ""So when it comes to Iran or ISIS the enemy of your enemy is your enemy.""

Netanyahu thanked lawmakers for decades of support and said Israelis were protected last summer from Hamas rocket attacks ""because this Capitol Dome helped build our Iron Dome.""

He then turned to Iran, warning that ""Iran's regime poses a great threat not only to Israel but also to the peace of the entire world.""

""Iran's regime is as radical as ever,"" Netanyahu said. ""This regime will always be an enemy of America.""

Netanyahu warned that if the Iran nuclear deal is accepted ""that deal will not prevent Iran from getting nuclear weapons,"" but ""it will guarantee"" Iran gets the bomb.

The Israeli prime minister heavily criticized a nuclear deal under negotiations between the United States, Iran and the other so-called P5+1 world powers.

""It doesn't block Iran's path to the bomb. It paves Iran's path to the bomb,"" he said.

Netanyahu called on Congress not to lift restrictions on Iran until Iran stops its aggression against its neighbors in the Middle East, stop supporting terrorism around the world, and stop threatening to annihilate Israel.

""For over a year we've been told that no deal is better than a bad deal,"" he said. ""Well this is a bad deal. A very bad deal. We're better off without it.""

Netanyahu said Israel can defend itself and promised to act unilaterally against Iran if necessary, though he believes the U.S. would stand with Israel.

""As prime minister of Israel, I can promise you more than one thing: even if Israel has to stand alone, Israel will stand,"" he said. ""I know that Israel does not stand alone! I know that America stands with Israel!"" he said. ""My friends, may Israel and America always stand together, strong and resolute. May we neither fear nor dread the challenges ahead. May we face the future with confidence, strength and hope.""

Dozens of Democrats skipped the address, although every seat on the floor and gallery was filled with more than 1,100 people listening to the prime minister in the chamber.

“I was near tears throughout the Prime Minister’s speech – saddened by the insult to the intelligence of the United States as part of the P5 +1 nations, and saddened by the condescension toward our knowledge of the threat posed by Iran and our broader commitment to preventing nuclear proliferation,” House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California, noted. “We have all said that a bad deal is worse than no deal, and stopping the spread of nuclear weapons is the bedrock of our foreign policy and national security.”

During his speech, Netanyahu acknowledged his speech has been ""subject of great controversy,"" but he said it was ""never my intention"" in accepting the invitation.

House Speaker John Boehner invited Netanyahu to address Congress without consulting the White House or Congressional Democrats shortly after the president delivered his State of the Union address.

Some Democrats had complained that the invitation was inappropriate given the Israeli elections just two weeks away, and a deadline to strike a nuclear deal with Iran that looms at the end of the month. Republicans however, contended that the invitation comes at a critical juncture in foreign policy.

“The Prime Minister’s address coincides with an increasingly aggressive Iranian campaign to expand its sphere of influence across the Middle East,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, said today. “It represents a threat to both our countries. It represents a threat to moderate Sunni allies, and it represents a threat to the international community at large. That’s why Prime Minister Netanyahu is here today.”"

“They don’t talk to us, we don’t talk to them,” he said.

“There is no dialogue. There is, let’s say, information but not dialogue,” Assad said.

By carrying out missions in the skies over Syria, Assad said, “they easily trample over international law.”

Assad appeared confident and defiant during the half-hour interview. He dismissed video evidence and widespread accusations by human rights groups that his military has dropped “barrel bombs” – canisters packed with explosives – on civilian populations.

“We have bombs, missiles and bullets. No indiscriminate weapons,” Assad said. “There are no barrel bombs, we don’t have barrels.

“When you shoot you aim, and when you shoot, when you aim, you aim at terrorists in order to protect civilians,” he added. “You cannot have war without casualties.""

Those bombs, Human Rights Watch reported last year, contain cylinders of chlorine gas. Syria agreed to hand over its entire chemical weapons arsenal for destruction but has still faced accusations that it continues to use chlorine gas, another charge Assad denied.

The president danced around questions about personal mistakes he has made during the now almost four-year war in Syria, saying simply, “everybody makes mistakes.”

He also called it a “fantasy” that the early protests against his government – long before ISIS and al Qaeda had a foothold in Syria – were peaceful, pointing to police who were “not killed by sound waves.”

From the beginning, the Assad government has claimed that it was battling terrorists, that there was no moderate rebel movement. Assad still claims that he has popular support. Otherwise, he said, “how could I stay in power?”

Assad’s confidence didn’t waver during the interview, even when asked at the end what keeps him up at night.

“Many reasons that could affect any human,” he answered. “Could be your job, could be personal. Like any other human.”"

“I still love my nephew, no matter what he did,” Sundae Hughes told ABC News in an exclusive interview.

Hughes said she helped raise Routh, but the two lost touch during his military service. She talks to her nephew from jail every week, she said.

The trial of Routh -- accused in the fatal 2013 shootings of Kyle and friend Chad Littlefield -- continues today. Routh’s defense team says he has post-traumatic stress disorder and was temporarily insane at the time of the shootings.

Routh admits that he shot Kyle and Littlefield multiple times in the back. His motive remains a mystery.

Sheriff’s Deputy Gene Cole testified in court Friday that he overheard Routh discussing the shooting.

“I shot them because they wouldn’t talk to me,” Routh said, according to Cole. “I was just riding in the back seat of the truck and nobody would talk to me ... I’m sure they have forgiven me.”

During opening statements, defense attorneys revealed the two victims secretly exchanged text messages about Routh.

""This dude is straight-up nuts,"" Kyle texted to Littlefield, the defense claimed.

Texas Ranger David Armstrong testified Friday that various drug-related objects were found in Routh’s home -- including ceramic pipes, a bong, a drug grinder and marijuana."

Helle Merete Brix, one of the organizers of the meeting Saturday titled ""Art, Blasphemy and Freedom of Expression,"" where one person was killed and three police officers wounded after a gunman opened fire, called the experience ""surreal.""

When the gunfire started, she said, the Swedish state security guards and Danish intelligence officers there ""reacted very quickly.""

""They were in the lobby and if they hadn't shot back, he could have shot his way through and something like Charlie Hebdo could have happened,"" she said, referring to the attack on the office of the satirical Paris newspaper last month in which 12c people were killed.

When the shooting started she said, in an interview with ABC News' Terry Moran, no one quite knew for a moment what was happening.

""I was conducting the meeting,"" she said. ""I was talking about freedom of speech. We heard all this noise. The next thing that happened the security guys told everybody to run out as fast as you can.

""I had this surreal experience, what was going on, when the security guard started shouting I thought my god this is an attack,"" she said.

The guards told them all to go into a storage room, where she said they dove under a table.

""We held hands and told bad jokes,"" she said. ""There was a lot of beer.""

Like Swedish artist Lars Vilks, one of the co-hosts of the event who has faced numerous death threats after drawing a cartoon of the Prophet Muhammad in 2007, she said she knew there was danger.

""Even though we knew there was a risk, we didn't expect anything like this to happen -- then this horror and death,"" she said.

She said it is too important to stand up for the value of free speech.

""We're fighting a battle, but freedom of speech is the core value of western society,"" she said. ""Without freedom of speech, other values aren't worth much. You can discuss and disagree in a civilized matter.""

Hours after the shooting at the cafe, a gunman -- believed by police to be the same man -- opened fire near a synagogue in the city, killing one man and wounding two police.

Officers later confronted the suspect in the Noerrebro district of the city, and he was killed in a shootout, police said.

""I don't feel responsible, but I feel a lot of sorrow that this happened,"" she said. ""There's only one person to blame and that's the guy who fired the shots."""

But while research suggests it does work, there are some caveats. Tod Cooperman, MD, president of the independent testing group ConsumerLab.com, provides the scoop:

Popping zinc within 24 hours of the start of symptoms helps shorten your sniffle, according to a 2013 Cochrane review. The authors say significant effects were seen at doses of at least 75 mg (the equivalent of three or four lozenges) per day, taken as long as your cold lasts. How does it work? The theory, according to the Mayo Clinic, is that zinc may keep cold viruses from multiplying and taking up residence in your nose and throat. But don’t bother taking it just to take it; there’s no evidence it’ll actually prevent a cold.

Best and Worst Foods to Eat When You’re Sick

Back in 2009, the U.S. Food & Drug Administration warned against using zinc gel sprays and nasal swabs after receiving more than 130 reports of people losing their sense of smell after using these products. (The manufacturer pulled the products from store shelves, though they claim no link has been established.)
Though you can no longer buy zinc nasal spray, it’s still available as a throat spray, which might be problematic, according to Dr. Cooperman. “If you spray it into your throat it can still go up your nose,” Dr. Cooperman says.
The best way to go is still the good old lozenge. Just make sure you suck—not crunch—it: “It needs to dissolve slowly to be effective so it can coat your throat,” explains Dr. Cooperman.

Best and Worst Exercises to Do When You Have a Cold

In order for a lozenge to provide enough zinc to be effective, it needs to contain between 13 and 23 milligrams, Dr. Cooperman says. Yet only two of the four lozenges Consumer Lab tested—Cold-Eeze Homeopathic Cold Remedy and Nature’s Way Zinc—provided enough. (There are other brands of zinc they didn’t test.)

The safe upper limit for zinc in adults is 40 milligrams per day, as determined by the Institute of Medicine. While it’s okay to exceed that 40mg limit for three to five days (or roughly the length of a cold), you still don’t want to down the lozenges like crazy. At most, only take one every three hours if you’re sick, and limit yourself to one a day if you’re healthy: “Too much zinc can actually depress your immune system,” explains Dr. Cooperman.

Earlier, officials including Mexico City Mayor Miguel Angel Mancera and Fausto Lugo, the head of Mexico City Civil Protection, reported that seven people had been killed. They later revised the number down to two dead in the explosion and aftermath.

The explosion led to the collapse of 30 percent of the hospital building and the injuries to at least 54 people, including 22 children, according to Mancera.

Not all the injuries were serious, Mancera said, adding that many of those injured were hit with flying glass after the explosion.

Ismael Garcia, 27, told the AP he ran towards the hospital after hearing the blast.

""Fortunately, we were able to get eight babies out,"" he said.

Borough chief Adrian Rubalcava posted dramatic photographs of the scene on Twitter just after the explosion and called for more ambulances to help transport the injured to other hospitals.

Rubalcava also posted pictures that appeared to show rescue teams with dogs arriving at the site of the explosion.

The explosion happened after gas leaked out of a fuel truck during a delivery to the hospital's kitchen, the AP reported.

""The hose broke. The two gas workers tried to stop it, but they were very nervous. They yelled for people to get out,"" said Laura Diaz Pacheco, a laboratory technician, according to the AP.

""Everyone's initial reaction was to go inside, away from the gas,"" she added. ""Maybe as many as 10 of us were able to get out ... The rest stayed inside.""

An evacuation of the hospital began amid calls for firefighters when the explosion occurred, witnesses said, according to the AP.

On Sunday, core-ISIS officially anointed its Libyan affiliate by releasing a savage new video of camouflage-clad jihadis dramatically slicing the necks of 21 Coptic Christians from Egypt who were abducted in Libya.

The video had similar graphics and cinematic flourishes to ISIS' other major pieces of propaganda from Syria and Iraq, including track and crane camera moves as the victims in orange jumpsuits compliantly knelt in the wet sand of a Mediterranean beach for their final living moments as stars of the Libyan ISIS affiliate's debut.

While ISIS has increasingly been publicizing its presence in Libya -- and worrying many U.S. counter-terrorism officials, who say Western leaders have been too distracted by such hostage execution videos themselves -- the group's expansion is meeting resistance from the clearly dominant jihadi groups there with ties to core-al Qaeda, experts say.

""Because ISIS is so brazen in what they do and their propaganda machine is so prolific with videos like this, it's easy to see where their fighters are and what they're doing,"" Thomas Joscelyn, an ISIS expert and senior fellow at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, told ABC News. ""Al Qaeda and their allies try to hide what they're up to. They don't advertise it with videos.""

Al Qaeda's experienced operatives, whether currently in the group or with experience fighting with them, are plentiful in Libya. Several groups with clear links to al Qaeda in Pakistan were involved with overrunning two U.S. diplomatic and intelligence compounds in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012, which killed four Americans including the ambassador. ISIS is directly challenging them in Libya, Afghanistan, Pakistan, the Sinai and in Yemen.

""The whole Islamic State strategy is to peel away the most extreme among the extremists, the most hardened, violent part of the jihadist world,"" Joscelyn said. ""Al Qaeda, on the other hand, is trying to control and rein in the violence. It's two different models.""

Video Draws Deadly Retaliation

Egypt struck back Monday after ISIS released the video showing the beheading of the 21 Egyptian Coptic Christians. Claiming to target ISIS arms depots and training camps in the east of the country, state TV said Egypt launched airstrikes at dawn in “response to criminal acts of terrorism elements and organizations.”

A spokesperson for Libyan Prime Minister Abdullah al–Thinni, who holds tenuous control over Libya’s internationally recognized government, told the BBC that the Egyptian strikes were part of a coordinated effort with Libya to strike the eastern city of Derna, home to extremists loyal to the Islamic State.

It’s the first attack inside Libya that Egypt has publicly acknowledged -- in spite of accusations from Islamists in Libya that Egypt has carried out strikes on jihadists on behalf of Libya’s air force.

""Eight strikes have been conducted so far. The plan is to target all IS [ISIS] locations in the country wherever they are,"" said Mohamed Bzazh, a Libyan government spokesman.

Libyan Air force commander Saqer al-Joroushi told Reuters that Libyan planes had targeted Sirte and Bin Jawad, and on Egyptian state TV, Joroushi said the strikes had killed “not less than 40 or 50” people.

""What happened now is not the first crime, and it's a clear proof and confirmation of the increasing threat of terrorism in Libya,” Bzazah said.

In the nearly four years since longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi was killed in Libya, the country has been plagued by instability giving birth to opportunist militant groups nationwide and two rival governments, one led by the Libya Dawn movement in Tripoli and the second, headed by al-Thinni, operated out of Bayda and Tobruk.

Libya 'Ripe' for ISIS

Over the last year, the combination of Libya’s civil war breaking out and the rapid rise of ISIS in Syria and Iraq means Libya was “a really ripe opportunity for ISIS seeking to expand,” said Christopher Chivvis, associate director of the International Security and Defense Policy Center and a senior political scientist with the Rand Corporation.

Analysts said jihadis loyal to ISIS began to gain a foothold in the country last fall but burst into the limelight at the end of January when five foreigners, including an American, were killed at Tripoli’s Corinthia Hotel by attackers pledging allegiance to the group led by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

Chivvis said there’s no doubt a relationship exists between the Libyan Islamists and to the core ISIS group, which released the weekend video, “but I would be surprised if it was one of direct command and control -- if these groups were taking orders on specific operations directly.”

“More likely,” he said, ""they’re inspired by the idea of what appears to be the most popular and most gruesome jihadists organization today. ... And it’s clear that ISIS is actively trying to encourage them.”

Last month, ISIS spokesman Abu Muhammad al-Adnani challenged al Qaeda on its home turf by welcoming in an audio speech the pledges of fealty made by some Taliban commanders.

""The factions will assemble against you and the rifles and bayonets will multiply against you. But you are up to it, with Allah’s permission. So unsheathe your swords and take out your spears,"" al-Adnani advised them."

The CSX train had 109 cars - 25 of which derailed around 1:17 p.m., and about half of those cars caught fire or are leaking oil. Several of the cars spilled into the Kanawha River, officials said.

About 200 people are in shelters, according to Fayette County Emergency Services.

The fire is expected to burn until early Tuesday morning, according to Robert Jelacic at the WV Division of Homeland Security And Emergency Services.

""There is no evidence upon which prosecutors can rely to disprove Wilson's stated subjective belief that he feared for his safety,"" the DOJ criminal report said.

According to the report, Wilson ""saw Brown reach his right hand under his t-shirt into what appeared to be his waistband.""

Accounts that Brown put his hands up are ""inaccurate because they are inconsistent with the physical and forensic evidence,"" the report says.

Witness accounts were ""inconsistent"" and ""changed over time,"" it also said.

""The promise I made when I went to Ferguson and at the time that we launched our investigation was not that we would arrive at a particular outcome, but rather that we would pursue the facts, wherever they led,"" said US Attorney General Eric Holder. ""Our investigation has been both fair and rigorous from the start. It has proceeded independently of the local investigation that concluded in November. And it has been thorough: as part of a wide-ranging examination of the evidence, federal investigators interviewed and re-interviewed eyewitnesses and other individuals claiming to have relevant information and independently canvassed more than 300 residences to locate and interview additional witnesses.""

Holder added, ""This conclusion represents the sound, considered, and independent judgment of the expert career prosecutors within the Department of Justice. I have been personally briefed on multiple occasions about these findings. I concur with the investigative team’s judgment and the determination about our inability to meet the required federal standard.""

The Justice Department also released its investigation of the Ferguson police, which found a pattern and practice of discriminatory policing.

The report includes seven racist emails sent by Ferguson officers. In its review, the Justice Department found 161 use of force complaints against the Ferguson police from 2010 to 2014. Only one case was founded and no officer was disciplined.

Those conclusions came nearly seven months after a confrontation with Wilson that left Brown dead. In the wake of the controversial slaying of unarmed teenager Trayvon Martin, Brown’s death reignited a national debate over race in America and sparked protests across the country.

With its findings now public, the Justice Department is likely to seek agreement from the Ferguson police department to implement serious changes to its practices. But if negotiations fail, then the Justice Department would likely file a civil lawsuit against the police force, hoping a federal judge will force the police department to enact appropriate changes.

In a news conference late today, Ferguson Mayor James Knowles said the city has cooperated with the DOJ, received the results of the investigation and has already acted on changes, including diversity training for police and African-American hires. The city immediately placed three employees who allegedly sent racially-charged emails on administrative leave. One of the three has been fired and the fate of the others awaits the results of an internal investigation. ""That type of behavior will not be tolerated,"" Knowles said. ""We must do better not only as a city but as a state and country.""

Aaron Schock Resigns After Offensive Facebook Posts Come to Light - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/senior-aide-rep-aaron-schock-resigns-offensive-facebook-posts/story?id=28756347,"A senior advisor to Illinois Republican Rep. Aaron Schock has resigned in disgrace hours after racially insensitive posts he wrote on Facebook came to light today.

Benjamin Cole, who joined Schock’s office as senior advisor for policy and communications in March 2014, confirmed in a text message to ABC News that he resigned.

""I am extremely disappointed by the inexcusable and offensive online comments made by a member of my staff,"" Schock wrote in a statement released by his office. ""I would expect better from any member of my team. Upon learning about them I met with Mr. Cole and he offered his resignation which I have accepted.”

Cole’s racist posts were first reported by ThinkProgress and Buzzfeed.

Before joining Schock’s office, Cole posted a series of videos and comments on October 13, 2013 mocking two African-Americans outside his apartment in Washington, DC, comparing them to zoo animals. About two months later, Cole took to Facebook to report witnessing a shooting of “one of the hood rats on my street” by “another hood rat.”

Buzzfeed also found a post from August 16, 2010 where Cole suggested that a mosque be built on the White House grounds to give President Obama a ‘house of worship.’

“I just think it would be nice for the President to have his own house of worship, since he’s not been able to find one suitable in DC since 2004 when he moved here,” Cole wrote.

The posts have since been deleted.

Cole previously held positions in the House of Representatives from 2009 to 2011."

1zLICx1,2015-02-17 00:00:00,"Despite Horror in Libya, Experts Warn Against Military Action - ABC News",http://abcnews.go.com/International/International/horror-libya-experts-warn-military-action/story?id=29022752,"As Egypt’s Coptic Christian community mourned the 21 Egyptians beheaded by the Libyan affiliates of ISIS, Egypt’s president called for a U.N. resolution mandating an international intervention in Libya -- a move experts argue may plunge Libya deeper into crisis.

""We will not allow them to cut off the heads of our children,” Egyptian President Abdel Fatah el-Sisi told France’s Europe 1 Radio today. ""There is no other choice,” he added. ""We have to work together to defeat terrorism.""

Sisi referred to the 2011 NATO campaign which launched airstrikes directed at former dictator Moamar Gadhafi’s troops and imposed a no-fly zone over parts of the country, as an “unfinished mission” that ""abandoned the Libyan people as prisoners to extremist militias.""

In the nearly four years since longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi was killed in Libya, the country has been plagued by instability giving birth to those opportunistic militant groups nationwide and two rival governments locked in an escalating -– and increasingly complicated civil war.

""The options going forward -- from a U.S. and NATO perspective -- are all bad,"" said Chris Chivvis, Associate Director, International Security and Defense Policy Center and a Senior Political Scientist at the Rand Corporation.

The U.N.-backed international intervention Sisi called for today doesn’t appear to have the support of Libya, nor its neighbors across the Mediterranean.

""This is the job of the Libyan armed forces currently, what we need now is support from other countries, including arms support,” Libyan military spokesperson Col. Ahmed Al-Mosmari told Ahram Online today, lobbying for an end to an arms embargo. Part of the internationally recognized government based out of Tobruk, Libya, Al-Mosmari stopped short of asking for foreign boots on the ground, but said all options were on the table as Libya plots its next move.

Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzo played down talk of Italian involvement in a military operation, after initially warning his European allies to “stop sleeping” as the extremists grow stronger just 500 miles south from Italy’s southern tip.

""We've been saying at every level that Libya is out of control for three years and we'll keep doing so,” Renzi told Mediaset.

Adding today, after a meeting with his top ministers: ""There was renewed Italian commitment for strong diplomatic action within the framework of the U.N. and support for an urgent initiative at the Security Council to promote stability and peace in Libya.”

Italian and European reticence to commit to any kind of international intervention is a combination of both politics and economics, explained Frederic Wehrey, Senior Associate, Middle East Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

""Libya is bad, but they also have Ukraine to worry about,” he said, questioning the details of the unlikely UN-backed force, where it would deploy and who would foot the bill.

“It is not for today to consider any contribution of the European Union to any sort of military action,"" EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Federica Mogherini made clear to reporters in Madrid. ""Daesh is a threat to the entire country, to all Libyans and that will require a joint action to face the threat in Libya,"" she added, saying she would discuss possibilities with both the United States and Egypt later this week.

But regardless of leadership, any kind of military action aimed at ISIS, Wehrey said, would likely add oil to the domestic fire already blazing –- not help extinguish it. For example, each side could use the threat to take advantage, expanding the target set to include political opponents.

Experts say the key is to establish a ceasefire and a unity government but the means to those ends remain murky as the battlefield lines continue to blur. Though cautious, Wehrey puts his money on the U.N.-brokered peace talks that kicked off in Geneva last month but success depends on keeping pragmatic players from all sides at the table.

“Ending the civil war must be first and foremost -- but the question is how do you solve the terrorism problem without stressing existing political fissures? You don’t want to empower the militias –- you don’t want to take sides because that could derail the democratic transition.”

He added, “the risk of failure [of an international military intervention] is very, very high."""

Michael Wagner greeted his daughter Phuoc with, ""Hey mon belle,"" or, ""Hey, my beauty,” in a video posted to the family’s Facebook page. The reunion occurred just five days after he donated part of his liver to the child.

Wagner was brought to tears as he sat down on his adoptive daughter's bed and asked her how she felt in French.

Wagner underwent a lengthy surgery on Feb. 10 to donate a portion of his liver to Phouc. Both Phouc and her twin sister, Binh, needed liver transplants after suffering liver damage because of a genetic condition called Alagille syndrome.

While Wagner was a match for both girls, he can only undergo the procedure to be a living donor once. Doctors picked Phuoc for the first donation because of her more advanced need.

Today, Wagner's wife, Johanne Wagner, gave an update on Phuoc and her husband, saying both were still recovering.

“So hard to believe we are hitting the one week mark: it seems like a blurr,” wrote Johanne Wagner on Facebook. “Michael still in hospital, Phuoc still on morphine, and mommy holding on on coffee. Still a fair amount of discomfort for Michael but he managed to visit his little girl two days in a row.”

While Phuoc remains in recovery, the twins’ medical team and the Wagners have continued to search for a liver donor for Binh. The family has started a campaign on social media asking for the public’s help.

Last week, doctors at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto said that they have received 400 submissions from people offering to be a living donor for Binh, according to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.

Dr. Gary Levy, the director of the living donor liver program at Toronto General Hospital, said the medical team hoped to find a donor for Binh within the next few days to weeks, and told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation at a news conference that the medical team expects they “will define several individuals who can step forward and be a donor for Binh.”

Phuoc and Binh were adopted by the Wagners in 2012 from Vietnam. The couple also has seven other children."

The oldest man in Australia spends his time knitting tiny wool sweaters for tiny, injured penguins.

The prolific knitter told Australia's Channel Nine News that when Phillip Island’s Penguin Foundation requested the tiny sweaters following a massive oil spill that injured hundreds of Little Penguins, a species only found in southern Australia and New Zealand, he couldn’t refuse.

""The girls who used to work for me, they'll tell you I'm a sucker. I can't say no,” Date told Nine News.

""It's a good way of getting along in life. You make friends all the time but you don't make a fool of yourself either,” he added.

Date has been knitting for more than 80 years, but this was his first foray into bird knitwear. The Penguin Foundation stresses to eager knitters that “this is not a fashion statement"" -- the sweaters actually prevent the injured penguins from preening and swallowing the toxic oil.

The foundation dubbed Date their “most senior little penguin jumper knitter,"" but they didn’t realize Date was also the most senior Australian citizen.

""It's amazing and we feel quite privileged to have him dedicating his time and effort to the Penguin Foundation,” a spokesperson told Nine News.

But settle down young knitters, according to the Foundation’s website, they ""have plenty of penguin jumpers at this time donated by generous knitters across the globe… and do not need any further donations at this time.”"

Biel told ""Good Morning America"" back in 2012 that taking on the role of a mom in ""Playing for Keeps"" definitely made her think about having a child one day.

""Yeah sure, especially because the kid Noah that played my son is literally the coolest kid I've ever met,"" she said, adding that the best part of being married to Timberlake was, ""it feels like nothing's changed, yet everything has changed. It's kind of that intangible thing. But I guess the idea of having sort of a partner in crime and I guess the word 'husband.' is pretty amazing.""

The couple just celebrated their two-year anniversary earlier this month by vacationing in New Zealand.

Timberlake posted a picture of him and his bride to Instagram two weeks ago with the caption, ""'Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.' --Ferris.""

This will be the first child for both the ""20/20 Experience"" singer and the ""7th Heaven"" actress."

The 42-year-old former defensive tackle for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and the Oakland Raiders, who now works for the NFL Network, was arrested at a local hotel on Monday morning on one count of solicitation of a prostitute and two counts of assault,  according to ABC 15.

Police told the local ABC affiliate that Sapp allegedly met two women in his hotel then went up to his room, where an altercation took place over money.

Sapp is a seven-time Pro Bowl selection, Super Bowl champion and was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2013. He was in Phoenix covering Super Bowl XLIX, which ended in a 28-24 victory for the New England Patriots.

According to police, he has denied assaulting the women, but allegedly admitted to the act of soliciting prostitution."

James Jones, Jr., 21, a junior studying chemistry, had responded to an ad in Craigslist to buy the phone on Monday night in Marietta, Georgia, about 20 miles north from his school.

""It was an illegitimate ad he was responding to and he did not know the sellers,"" Marietta Police officer David Baldwin told ABC News, adding that the posting appeared to be real. ""The ad was posted in the hopes to lure somebody in, but obviously the victim didn't know that.""

Three men were in custody by noon on Tuesday: Jordan Baker, 18; Jonathon Myles, 19; and Kaylnn Ruthenberg, 21. They were charged with felony murder, armed robbery and aggravated assault and were booked into the Cobb County adult detention center, according to police. A judge at Cobb County Magistrate court denied their bond at their first appearance today. They have not yet entered a plea.

A court clerk told ABC News she was not aware if the defendants have hired attorneys.

Jones’ brother called him a “bright young man” who wanted to be a doctor.

“My mother lost her son. My sister lost her brother. I lost my brother. So I don’t think we can put that into words. There was a lot of heartache,” Jones’ brother Samuel Heath said.

Jones was shot and killed while he was sitting in his car, Baldwin said.

""After he was shot, the car went forward, hit another car and a tree,"" Baldwin said.

Police were originally dispatched to the area with a report of a motor vehicle accident.

""Through the course of the investigation, they discovered that he was going to that area in response to a Craigslist ad,"" Baldwin said.

Jones was a native of Daytona Beach, Florida, and maintained a cumulative 3.08 GPA, according to Clark Atlanta University.

""This is a devastating loss for the Clark Atlanta University family,"" a statement from the university read. ""Mr. Jones was a serious scholar and a kind, engaging spirit whose work and comportment spoke well of the university's core values and those instilled long ago by those contributing to his upbringing. In addition to his studies, he was a UPS scholar at Fickett Elementary School and a science mentor for the HBCU Rising Cares Mentoring program at Brown Middle School. He also was an amateur athlete.""

Baldwin said police ""didn’t stop until all three were arrested.""

""It was a heck of an undertaking and investigation but it helps to bring closure to the family. We hope to give them peace to know that everyone involved in this senseless murder will be held accountable,"" Baldwin said.

Craigslist did not immediately respond to ABC News’ request for comment.

A private memorial service will be held on Thursday at noon for the university community and family."

Rand Paul said he's heard of cases where vaccines lead to “mental disorders” and argued that parents should be the ones to choose whether they vaccinate their children, not the government. Paul is a former ophthalmologist.

“I’ve heard of many tragic cases of walking, talking normal children who wound up with profound mental disorders after vaccines,” Paul, R-Ky., said in an interview with CNBC anchor Kelly Evans.

“I’m not arguing vaccines are a bad idea. I think they’re a good thing, but I think the parents should have some input,"" he added. ""The state doesn’t own your children. Parents own the children and it is an issue of freedom.”

Earlier in the day, Paul told Laura Ingraham that most vaccines “ought to be voluntary.”

Vaccinations have emerged as a political topic this week after President Obama urged Americans to vaccinate their children amid a measles outbreak.

""You should get your kids vaccinated,” the president said in an interview with NBC on Sunday.

In London today, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie offered an opposing view to the president's, saying that families should have a “measure of choice” in whether they should vaccinate their children.

""There has to be a balance and it depends on what the vaccine is, what the disease type is, and all the rest,"" Christie said, according to the Washington Post. ""Not every vaccine is created equal and not every disease type is as great a public health threat as others.""

However, the American Academy of Pediatrics affirmed today the importance of vaccines along with their relatively low risk of harm. In a statement, the group stressed that the MMR vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella is one of the safest and most effective vaccines given, and strongly urged parents to stick to the vaccine schedule recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."

Knight, 49, is scheduled to be arraigned Tuesday in Compton at the Los Angeles County Superior Court, authorities said. He is being held without bail.

Following an altercation on Thursday outside a Compton restaurant, Knight allegedly was driving his truck when he ran over two men standing in the parking lot. One man was injured and the second man, Terry Carter, 55, died. The driver of the pickup fled the scene.

Knight, who was out on bail in a separate robbery case, is charged with one count of murder, one count of attempted murder, two counts of hit-and-run with an allegation that he committed a serious and violent felony while out on bail in another pending case.

The complaint includes use of a deadly weapon and causing great bodily injury allegations and that Knight has prior convictions, making this a third strike case.

If convicted, Knight faces up to life in state prison. The case remains under investigation by the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department.

Knight has a long history as a rap pioneer, as well as a long history of trouble.

The ex-head of Death Row Records has been in the spotlight on and off since the early 1990s, supporting iconic artists on his former label such as Snoop Dogg and Tupac Shakur.

But there's more to Knight's story than his influence as a hip-hop mogul, or even his reported connection with an East Coast-West Coast rap feud that may have led to the deaths of Shakur and Bad Boy Records rapper Biggie Smalls.

The 6-foot-4 Knight also acquired a reputation as a dangerous and physically imposing man. In 1996, for instance, rapper Vanilla Ice told ABC News' Brian Ross that Knight dangled him off the balcony of a hotel in the early 1990s during an argument over money from the song ""Ice Ice Baby.""

""I needed to wear a diaper on that day,"" Vanilla Ice said. ""I was very scared.""

Knight denied the claim.

Knight was born in Compton, California and, after high school, he played football in college for UNLV before leaving in 1987, according to the Los Angeles Times.

Around the early 1990s, Knight went to work as a bodyguard in the music industry, which led to a stint as a talent manager.

Knight opened Death Row Records in 1992 with partner Dr. Dre, whose album ""The Chronic"" put the label on the map. The label really started to dominate the rap industry and bring so-called ""gansta rap"" to the forefront when Snoop Dogg followed Dre with his classic album ""Doggystyle"" in 1993. That album earned four- and five-star reviews from the likes of Rolling Stone and The Source. It went quadruple platinum.

In 1996, Shakur, who had just joined Death Row, released ""All Eyez on Me,"" a double album, which eventually racked up $10 million in sales, according to The Source.

The entire time Death Row was dominating the music industry, Knight seemed to be the publicity catalyst.

But there was also trouble.

In 1995, Knight famously attended the Source Awards and insulted Bad Boy frontman Sean Combs, now known as Diddy, about performing on his artists' songs.

""Anyone out there who wanna be a recording artist and wanna stay a star, but don't have to worry about the executive producer trying to be all in the videos, all on the records, dancing, come to Death Row,"" he said.

Some have speculated that was the point where the reported beef between Bad Boy (East Coast-based) and Death Row (West Coast-based) began.

After Shakur joined Death Row, the reported feud seemed to get worse. Shakur insulted Bad Boy's legendary rapper, The Notorious B.I.G., a.k.a. Christopher Wallace, on records such as ""Hit 'Em Up,"" which even talked about Walace's wife.

Other artists were attracted to Knight and his empire in the mid-1990s -- even M.C. Hammer, who signed with the label in 1995 in an apparent effort to shed his clean-cut image.

In 1996, Knight was behind the wheel of the car with Shakur in the passenger seat when Shakur was shot and killed in Las Vegas at age 25.

Wallace was shot and killed months later in 1997 at age 24 in Los Angeles.

Unrelated to the murders of the two rap stars, Knight did jail time from the late 1990s to 2001 for violating probation on a 1992 assault and weapons case. In 2003, he went to prison again for the same offense.

It was around that time that Knight's Death Row records began to falter. Dre left in 1996 and, that same year, one of his bodyguards was shot during a dispute and later fired, according to the Times.

After Snoop Dogg left the label, as well, Knight filed for bankruptcy years later in the mid-2000s, according to LegalZoom.

In 2005, Knight was shot in 2005 at a VMA's party hosted by Kanye West.

Death Row was sold in 2008.

Before last week's arrest, Knight was arrested in Las Vegas in 2012 and was given three years' probation for driving without a license.

He was shot yet again in 2014 at a pre-VMAs Party hosted by Chris Brown. That shooting happened at 1:36 a.m. at 10ak in West Hollywood, where Brown was having an album release party, a source told ABC News at the time. His multiple gunshot wounds required surgery.

Knight also has another active case against him. He was charged with robbery late in 2014 over a claim that he stole a photographer's camera and expected back in court later this month. He pleaded not guilty to the charge.

1zoG64l,2015-02-07 00:00:00,Parents of American ISIS Hostage Kayla Mueller Plead for Response from Terror Group - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/International/parents-american-isis-hostage-kayla-mueller-plead-response/story?id=28776563,"The parents of an American woman held hostage by ISIS revealed they had privately communicated with the terror group before it claimed she was killed a recent Jordanian airstrike.

A statement that circulated Twitter on Friday said an airstrike outside Raqqa, Syria, killed Kayla Mueller. The statement used her full name, which had not been public.

The claim could not be immediately confirmed and ISIS did not provide photographic evidence of Mueller’s death, as the group has in the past with other hostages and its own fighters.

In a statement released Friday night, Mueller's parents said, ""This leaves us concerned, yet, we are still hopeful that Kayla is alive.""

Addressing Kayla's captors directly, Carl and Marsha Mueller also requested that the terror group respond to their private communications.

""Kayla's mother and I have been doing everything we can to get her released safely. At this time we ask you, who are holding Kayla, to contact us privately,"" the statement said.

A spokesperson for the White House National Security Council said they have “not at this time seen any evidence that corroborates ISIL’s claim,” using an alternate acronym for the terror group.

A Jordanian official told ABC News ISIS's claim was ""illogical"" and was part of the terror group's public relations campaign. ""We need to be very careful not to fall in their trap,"" the official said.

Jordan's Foreign Minister Nasser Judeh, called ISIS's claim ""an old and sick trick.""

""So they behead innocent #US #UK & Japan hostages & BURN a brave #jordan pilot ALIVE & now a hostage is killed by an airstrike? Sure! Sick!"" Judeh said on Twitter, referring to previous atrocities apparently committed on camera by ISIS fighters.

The ISIS statement appeared to contain some discrepancies, including Thursday’s date on accompanying pictures purportedly showing the building that was struck, while the statement claimed the strikes occurred during Friday prayers. ISIS also claimed Mueller, 26, was the only person killed in that particular airstrike, with none of its fighters injured or killed.

Officials believe ISIS has misled the public before about the fate of hostages. The Jordanian government said ISIS killed a Jordanian pilot the terror group was holding a month ago, even though the terror group pretended he was alive during hostages negotiations last week.

In August, ABC News reported ISIS had demanded $6.6 million for Mueller's release.

“We are pouring through information right now,” one U.S. official said, “but there is no hard evidence” that Mueller has been killed. Another official said that U.S. intelligence had reason to believe Mueller was alive as of a few weeks ago.

Mueller, from Prescott, Ariz., was kidnapped Aug. 4, 2013 after leaving a Spanish Doctors Without Borders hospital in Aleppo, Syria, according to information provided by a family spokesperson.

She had graduated from Northern Arizona University in 2009 and “has devoted her career to helping those in need in countries around the world,” the family spokesperson said."

The statement said the alleged assailant, Kim Ki-jong, 55, gave “a knife-attack shower of justice” to Mark Lippert, who police said was slashed on the face and wrist with a 10-inch fruit knife.

The assailant shouted, ""No to war training"" before attacking Lippert, the Yonhap news agency reported. The man was reportedly later tackled and arrested.

The suspect’s reported comments touch on a deep political divide in South Korea over the still-fresh legacy of the 1950-53 Korean War, which is still technically ongoing because it ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty. Some South Koreans blame the presence of 28,500 U.S. troops stationed in the South as a deterrent to the North for the continuing split of the Korean Peninsula along the world's most heavily armed border – a view North Korea's propaganda machine regularly pushes in state media.

The U.S. State Department condemned the attack, which happened at a performing arts center in downtown Seoul as the ambassador was preparing for a lecture about prospects for peace on the divided Korean Peninsula.

In a televised briefing, Chung Nam-sik of the Severance Hospital said the knife penetrated through Lippert's left arm and damaged the nerves connected to his pinkie and tendons connected to his thumb. Lippert will need to be treated at the hospital for the next three or four days and might experience sensory problems in his left hand for several months, Chung said.

President Obama called Lippert to tell him ""he and his wife Robyn are in his thoughts and prayers, and to wish him the very best for a speedy recovery,” according to National Security Council spokeswoman Bernadette Meehan.

Lippert previously held positions at the Department of Defense from May 2012 until September 2014, according to the embassy website.

The police officer in question, whose name has not been released, cited Cobb County's distracted driver law.

Cobb County Solicitor General Barry Morgan said in a written statement Friday that his office submitted a dismissal of the case against Madison Turner, and a judge signed it. Morgan said the state didn't believe it had the evidence to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt, given the facts and circumstances his office investigated, according to the AP.

""Maybe I was enjoying the burger too much. I needed to tone it down,” driver Madison Turner told ABC News affiliate WSB-TV last month. “I was certainly willing to do so but I didn’t expect to be fined or punished.”

Turner's attorney earlier said he expected the ticket to be overturned because many drivers, himself included, eat and drive.

""I’ve only seen something like this charge when there’s an accident,” attorney William Head said to WSB-TV. “There was no accident here, so the fact that this man was charged with eating and driving is a first for me.”"

Police revealed this week that Tammy Meyers and her armed son got in a car to look for the driver with whom she had a dispute last Thursday. She had been teaching her 15-year old daughter how to drive in the parking lot of a nearby school.

The fundraising page's original post read, ""The suspects followed Tammy and her daughter home and opened fire."" The campaign had raised about $6,000.

But police revised the timeline to say that Meyers drove home and asked her daughter to tell her son Brandon Meyers, 22, to come to the car. When the mother and son returned home, police said, the suspect's car pulled up. Gunfire erupted and Meyers was fatally wounded. She died Saturday at the University Medical Center of Southern Nevada.

Disgruntled donors criticized the fundraising page for not revealing that the mother and son had sought out the other car. Police are still looking for that driver.

""I'm reporting it to GoFundMe,"" one GoFundMe user had posted. ""So many lies from the family.""

The GoFundMe page is no longer available.

The victim's family Wednesday confirmed to ABC affiliate station KTNV in Las Vegas that Meyers' husband posted a Facebook statement that read in part, ""At this time I have shut down the GoFundMe account that I didn't start, a friend did. Everyone will get donations returned. I never said anything different than told. If all you people think I was a fraud and lied about facts, I'm truly sorry. I only ever said what was told to me."""

Bill Richard was talking about his son, Martin, who died when one of the two bombs detonated near the finish line of the Boston Marathon April 15, 2013. Two other people, 29-year-old Krystle Campbell and 23-year-old Lingzi Lu, were also killed, and another 260 were injured in the attack.

Bill Richard addressed the court in a clear, calm voice, describing the day that he and his family went to watch the runners. First, they ducked in to a Ben and Jerry’s for ice cream – Bill still remembers the flavor of ice cream that Martin got – and then found a spot to watch the runners near the finish line.

There is a photograph showing the Richard family as they watch the race. Martin had climbed on the metal crowd barrier a bit to get a better look. His family didn’t know that just then, seen in the same photograph just an arm’s length away, was then 19-year-old Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, allegedly dropping a backpack with a bomb inside.

When the bomb went off a few minutes later, Bill Richard’s daughter Jane lost her leg and Martin was killed.

“I saw a little boy who had his body severely damaged by an explosion,” Bill Richard told the jury flatly. “I just knew from what I saw that there was no chance.”

At the very end of his testimony, the last for the week, prosecutors asked Richard how old his boy was when he was killed.

“He was eight years old,” Richard said.

Tsarnaev’s defense said in opening statements they’re not going to contest the fact that their client, along with his late older brother Tamerlan, was responsible for detonating the two bombs that day.

Legal experts told ABC News the defense is likely focusing only on trying to avoid the death penalty for Tsarnaev in the penalty phase of the case."
1zR78NI,2015-03-05 00:00:00,"Recreational Marijuana: Prosecutors, County Sheriffs Challenge Amendement 64 - ABC News",http://abcnews.go.com/US/recreational-marijuana-prosecutors-county-sheriffs-challenge-amendement-64/story?id=29416431,"County sheriffs and prosecutors from three states launched a court challenge today against Colorado’s legalized marijuana, claiming that huge amounts of weed crossing state lines is placing an “undue burden” on the resources of small departments.

Colorado voters passed Amendment 64 legalizing recreational marijuana in November 2012. Retail stores began selling weed January 1, 2014, but pot is still considered illegal by the federal government.

""Amendment 64 is preempted by federal law and therefore violates the Supremacy Clause (Article VI) of the United States Constitution,” according to the lawsuit, filed today in federal court.

The plaintiffs—six Colorado sheriffs, four Nebraska sheriffs along with two county attorneys from Nebraska and Kansas— want the relevant sections of the Colorado constitution declared “invalid, null, and void.”

Speaking at the National Press Club in Washington D.C. today, Sheriff Mark Overman of Scott’s Bluff County, Nebraska says Colorado’s marijuana is a burden on taxpayers in his jurisdiction.

“Colorado’s legalization of marijuana has completely changed the landscape involving the marijuana that we encounter,” he said. ""Because of Amendment 64, our jails are full, our court dockets are full. There are increased costs for overtime, for incarceration.”

Overman also claims his deputies are busting more kids for pot.

“We are seeing a marked increase in the numbers of children as young as 13 that we are finding in possession of marijuana. We don’t want what Colorado has,"" he said.

Larimer County Colorado Sheriff Justin Smith also said legalized marijuana in his state has created a “constitutional showdown” for law enforcement.

“In Colorado every elected official, sheriffs included, are required under the state constitution to take an oath of office,” Smith said. “And that oath of office requires that they swear to defend the Constitution of the United States and the state of Colorado. Amendment 64 puts a conflict in those two parts of the oath of office.”

The Justice Department has said it will not take legal action against states that have approved recreational marijuana use.

Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper is named as the defendant in the lawsuit filed today.

Hickenlooper has not been formally served with the lawsuit, said his spokeswoman Kathy Green.

However, Green told ABC News, “We will continue to defend the will of the voters while prioritizing public safety.”

Marijuana advocates say the lawsuit is frivolous.

""These guys need to get over it,” said Mason Tvert with the Marijuana Policy Project.

""These law enforcement officers are trying to force marijuana cultivation and sales back into the underground market. Colorado adopted these laws in order to start controlling marijuana, and it's working,” Tvert told ABC News.

Recreational marijuana is now legal in Alaska, Colorado, Washington state and Washington, D.C."

Sea snails, known as limpets, have microscopic teeth that rival the strength of steel and bulletproof vests, according to a study published in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface.

Known for their conical umbrella-like shells, limpets use their strong teeth, which are fortified with a hard mineral called goethite, to scrape food off of rocks.

While slugs may not seem like the most exciting creatures, Asa Barber, a researcher who worked on the study, said scientists could use the knowledge to create a similar material that could be used on everything from aircraft and boats to dental fillings.

""These teeth are made up of very small fibers, put together in a particular way,"" he told the BBC. ""We should be thinking about making our own structures following the same design principles.""

In what may be the most exciting year ever in science for sea snails, scientists at the University of Utah last month released a study based on sea snails that sheds new light on insulin.

Cone snails have a have a unique high level of insulin in their venom that allow them to render small schools of fish sluggish by either shooting the potent venom into the water or via a harpoon-like sting.

The insulin has just 43 amino acid building blocks, making it shorter than any other known insulin, researchers said, noting that when the insulin mixes with venom, it creates a cocktail that is able to quickly slow down schools of fish and put them in hypoglycemic shock.

Aside from the ick and cool factors of the discovery, researchers said it could also be used to help them better understand how energy is metabolized in humans."

Sacks, a professor of neurology at New York University School of Medicine, said in a New York Times article that cancer had been found in his liver nine years after he was first diagnosed with a rare ocular tumor.

The doctor wrote that the initial treatment for the tumor in his eye left him partially blind and noted that most tumors of this kind do not metastasize.

""I am among the unlucky 2 percent,"" he wrote for the New York Times. ""I feel grateful that I have been granted nine years of good health and productivity since the original diagnosis, but now I am face to face with dying.""

Sacks, 81, is best known for his writing on neurological case histories including ""The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat"" and an ""An Anthropologist on Mars."" His book ""Awakenings,"" based on his work in the 1960s with patients who were unable to initiate movement, was turned into an Oscar-nominated movie of the same name starring Robin Williams and Robert De Niro.

Sacks, whose biography will be released this spring, wrote that he feels ""intensely alive"" after his diagnosis.

""Over the last few days, I have been able to see my life as from a great altitude, as a sort of landscape, and with a deepening sense of the connection of all its parts,"" he wrote. ""This does not mean I am finished with life.""

Two days after Egypt launched its first publicly acknowledged air strikes on what Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi claimed were weapons depots and Islamic State training camps, militants claiming loyalty to ISIS tore through the streets of the coastal city of Sirte in a public show of strength.

Men in camouflage gear and balaclavas waved Islamic State flags and drove what appeared to be brand new Toyotas.

In the nearly four years since longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi was killed in Sirte, the country has been plagued by instability giving birth to opportunist militant groups nationwide and two rival governments, one led by the Libya Dawn movement in Tripoli and the second, headed by the internationally recognized Prime Minister al-Thinni, operated out of Bayda and Tobruk.

Al-Thinni's government supports Operation Dignity, headed by General Khalifa Hifter, a group of eastern tribes, militias, federalists and Gadhafi-era career military officers. Since last summer, the two sides have been locked in an escalating civil war which has made it increasingly complicated to isolate the fight on terrorism, including that against ISIS.

U.S. officials believe there are a ""couple hundred"" militants in Islamic State training camps in eastern Libya but as Christopher Chivvis, associate director of the International Security and Defense Policy Center and a senior political scientist with the Rand Corporation, told ABC News this week these fighters are not necessarily taking orders from ISIS core.

“More likely,” he said, ""they’re inspired by the idea of what appears to be the most popular and most gruesome jihadists organization today. ... And it’s clear that ISIS is actively trying to encourage them.”

ISIS are relative newcomers on the ground in Libya, and analysts said jihadis loyal to ISIS began to gain a foothold in the country last fall but burst onto the international stage at the end of January when five foreigners, including an American, were killed at Tripoli’s Corinthia Hotel by attackers pledging allegiance to the group led by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

""But if they say they're [ISIS], then my view is, they are,"" Chivvis said."

The Oscar-nominated film brought in $31.9 million over the past two days -- the most a movie has ever earned during Super Bowl weekend -- according to the Associated Press.

But the records don't stop there.

The Iraq war film has now taken in $248.9 million in six weeks, the AP reports, making it the top-grossing war-themed movie ever, not accounting for inflation. This was a record previously held by ""Saving Private Ryan.""

""American Sniper"" stars Bradley Cooper as Chris Kyle, a former Navy SEAL who was killed at a Texas gun range in 2013, allegedly by a former Marine he was trying to help. Kyle, who served four tours in Iraq, was considered the deadliest sniper in U.S. military history. Kyle also helped found a veterans organization and wrote a best-selling autobiography.

""American Sniper"" is up for six Academy Awards, including best picture and best actor.

“Make-Up Time,” she tweeted. Then “Hair Time Now.”

The pictures showed a young woman with a sweet, round face and big eyes, known for her role in “American Horror Story.”

Hair Time Now by @NYIBeauty @carriehammer #RoleModelsNotRunwayModels #NYFashionWeek pic.twitter.com/cvigZMG97S

On TV, Brewer said she had conquered many fears, including “a drowning scene, attack of zombies, getting hit by a car ... in the first season, being dead and being dragged.”

But Thursday she was doing something she never thought she’d do. She was about to make history as the first model with Down Syndrome to walk the Fashion Week runway.

From Activist to Actress

Brewer was one of a dozen women carefully selected by designer Carrie Hammer to shatter model stereotypes. Billed as “Role Models Not Runway Models,” the show featured CEOs and marketing executives, philanthropists and bankers, computer coders and even a senior vice president whose job title at an ad agency was “Global Chief Creativity Catalyst.”

But of all the women at the top of their game, the star was Jamie Brewer.

“Jamie is an incredible actress and also an activist, an artist and a writer who just happens to have Down syndrome ... but that doesn’t define her,” Hammer said. “She’s an incredible role model for many, many people.”

In addition to being a successful actress, Hammer is also an advocate for people with intellectual disabilities. At 19 she was elected to the State of Texas ARC Board, and she also worked with the Governmental Affairs Committee for the State of Texas, as the only member with a disability.

”I’m a huge advocate for individuals with disabilities,” Brewer said. “Changing the minds of individuals [so they] get a better understanding of individuals that do have disabilities.”

“If you work at it, you can achieve it”

The activist turned actress prepared Thursday for her turn as a fashion model. “If you work at it, you can achieve it,” she said simply.

“We’re all really, really excited,” said designer Carrie Hammer. “I’m not nervous at all ‘cause everyone’s awesome.”

As the music swelled the models walked the catwalk one by one, posing at the end for pictures, then walking back. Poised and confident – some slightly nervous - they were dressed in stylish, classy clothes designed specifically for them.

The last to walk was Brewer. Wearing a black, V-neck dress cinched at the waist inspired by “American Horror Story,” she bounded onto the stage with a big smile and unbridled energy. In a blur of perpetual motion, she twirled, pointed her finger at the audience, shimmied and shook - all signature dance moves she said she created in honor of her costars."

Rob Ring, chief science officer of Autism Speaks, released a statement today stressing that vaccines do not cause autism, and parents should vaccinate.

""Over the last two decades, extensive research has asked whether there is any link between childhood vaccinations and autism,"" he said in the statement. ""The results of this research are clear: Vaccines do not cause autism. We urge that all children be fully vaccinated.""

The myth began with a now-debunked 1998 study linking the MMR vaccine -- which protects against measles, mumps and rubella -- to autism. The British Medical Journal retracted the study in February 2010, and study author Andrew Wakefield lost his medical license.

An editorial published in the British Medical Journal following the retraction called Wakefield's study ""fraudulent."" Wakefield stood to gain money from his findings because he was involved in a lawsuit against the MMR vaccine, according to the journal. He denied any wrongdoing.

Another study purporting to show a link between the MMR vaccine and autism was published in a much smaller journal over the summer, spurring the #CDCwhistleblower hashtag and conversation. But it, too, was retracted. The journal said in a statement that the study author had ""undeclared competing interests"" and that the journal had ""concerns"" over the author's methods, analysis and conclusion."

The Chinese e-commerce company said on its blog that it has began a three day drone delivery test to deliver a special type of tea purchased through its Taobao division. Customers must live within a one-hour quadcopter flight of Alibaba's warehouses in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou.

Some 450 customers are expected to be treated to drone delivery during the pilot, which ends Friday.

A video posted online shows the tea-carrying drones flying high above the busy city until landing outside a residential building where the package can be collected by a customer.

Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has for years shared his plan for Amazon to implement a drone delivery service, saying that one day the flying vehicles may be as common as seeing a mail truck.

Despite Amazon's tremendous push ahead in testing the drones, the company has been limited to private testing due to FAA restrictions on commercial drones."

Matthews, 25, was key for Seattle in the first half against the New England Patriots this evening during Super Bowl XLIV at University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Arizona.

ESPN reported that Matthews wasn't on Seattle's roster as far as two months ago -- but against the Patriots he showed how essential he can be to the team. He made four catches and was a MVP candidate until the Patriots won the game.

Cut by the Cleveland Browns in 2011, Matthews all but gave up on the NFL, and ended up playing in Canada before trying to make a living by working at Foot Locker and as a security guard.

Matthews recalled in an interview in the recent issue of Sports Illustrated how the Seahawks signed him. He got a phone call last year from a Seahawks official asking him to fly out that very evening for a tryout.

""I don't get off of work until 9 p.m. I don't know if I'll make it,"" he told the caller, according to Sports Illustrated.

""All right,"" the caller said. ""We'll let you know.""

Minutes later, Matthews' agent called him, according to the magazine.

""What are you thinking! Get yourself home, pack up and go. Are you out of your mind?!"" his agent said.

Matthews made the flight and the team's practice squad -- and the rest is history."

The birds were seen on a webcam at Codorus State Park set up by the Pennsylvania Game Commission.

As snow piled up on the birds’ nest, one of the eagles placed its body over the eggs.

Naturalist Jack Hubley told LancasterOnline.com that the layers of the bird’s feathers help to provide insulation to the bird and eggs tucked underneath.

The Pennsylvania Game Commission tweeted on Thursday that the eagles stay warm through winter by eating and fluffing their feathers for insulation.

Their eggs are kept warm underneath a “brooding patch.”

As spring continues to draw closer, eyes will once again be trained on the webcam as those eggs get ready to hatch."

Yasir Moore and his mother told ABC News station WTVD-TV in Durham, North Carolina, they credit exemplary Target employees Cathy Scott and Dennis Roberts with helping Moore pass the first round for his job interview at Chick-fil-A.

Chris Christie's Administration Facing New Criminal Investigation - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/jersey-gov-chris-christie-criminal-investigation/story?id=28753740,"Federal authorities have launched a criminal investigation into New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, as well as members of his administration, a man at the center of the investigation told ABC News.

The U.S. attorney’s office in New Jersey has interviewed former Hunterdon County Assistant Prosecutor Bennett Barlyn, who claims he was fired because he objected to Christie officials dismissing indictments against political allies of the governor. Barlyn confirmed the investigation to ABC News. It was first reported by the International Business Times.

“It is true,” Barlyn told ABC News, saying he was interviewed by federal authorities at his Pennsylvania home this week. “I also provided the investigators with names of people I thought could furnish firsthand information.”

Barlyn said he was not sure whether others have been questioned for the investigation.

Barlyn was dismissed from the Hunterdon County Prosecutor’s Office in September 2010 and later brought a whistleblower case against the Christie administration that currently is in the discovery phase. He has consistently said he was fired for objecting to the quashing of indictments against the county’s sheriff and two subordinates -- all political supporters of Christie’s.

The governor’s office previously has dismissed the accusations as being “conspiratorial nonsense.”

State officials have repeatedly denied Barlyn’s accusations and, in court filings, they said that the decision to dismiss the indictment was within the discretion of New Jersey’s top law-enforcement officials. They have argued Barlyn has no case and doesn’t even have the right to sue under state law.

The federal prosecutor's probe centers on why Christie’s then-attorney general, Paula Dow, dismissed the indictments.

Dow has rejected Barlyn's accusations, saying the indictment was flawed and Barlyn was fired for “legitimate business reasons,” according to NJ.com.

In a February 2014 interview, Barlyn outlined some of his grievances. He told ABC News' Jim Avila that all the evidence his former office obtained during its “two-year investigation was suddenly shipped back to [the state capital] Trenton. ... physically taken out of our office and taken to the attorney general's office.”

He called it “highly unusual,” adding, “The head of our special investigations unit who was heading the investigation was very abruptly taken off the case two weeks before the dismissal.”

Barlyn called the relationships between those being investigated and Christie “compelling,” adding “there’s simply photographic evidence” showing Christie “associating with these individuals.”

In the interview, Barlyn claimed he was fired for “political reasons.” He said the state attorney general gave him no explanation for his dismissal.

“I asked for one and was told that I wasn't entitled to an explanation,” Barlyn said. “I gave up my access to the building. I returned home again completely in the dark although I had a feeling of what precipitated the dismissal. My Internet connection to the office was cut off. And three weeks later I received a one-page faxed dismissal letter from the director of the Division of Criminal Justice. Again, no reason was given of why I was terminated after 18 years of being ... a state and county prosecutor with a pretty good rep.”

Barlyn added that he feels like he was “treated in a way that sent a message to my colleagues that if you complain, if you protest, if you see something wrong and speak out about it, you're going to punished. There's really no other explanation. I was afforded less due process than the criminals I prosecute for the most minor offenses. I wasn't allowed to give my side of the story. I wasn't allowed to justify what I did. I was simply hung out to dry in a very public fashion.”

Barlyn’s new meeting with investigators follows an April letter Barlyn wrote to New Jersey's U.S. attorney, Paul Fishman, telling him “we have no recourse left at the state level to expose this administration’s serious breach of the public trust.” Barlyn then asked Fishman to “open an investigation to explore any potential violations of the federal criminal code that may have occurred in connection with the Hunterdon matter,” adding he had “amassed a substantial body of documentation that corroborates the allegations of criminal wrongdoing by the state.”

In June, Fishman wrote to Barlyn asking him to be in touch with his office about the case, Barlyn said.

Fishman’s office will not comment on the case and Christie’s office did not immediately respond to request for comment, but the potential 2016 presidential candidate has long denied involvement in Barlyn’s termination.

Sources tell ABC News this new investigation is still in the early stages.

New Jersey’s U.S. attorney is also investigating the George Washington Bridge lane closures scandal that has jeopardized the governor’s political future. The Christie administration is also being investigated by the Manhattan District Attorney’s office, the Port Authority inspector general and a state legislative committee that is part of the Democratic-controlled New Jersey State Legislature.

But rather than face razor-sharp claws and teeth, the zookeepers faced a fellow employee acting out the part of the snow leopard in a suit. This isn't the first time the zoo has used an employee for an escaped animal drill, according to the AFP news agency.

In past years, the zoo has had to deal with an escaped ""zebra"" and ""gorilla,"" according to reports.

He declined to say whether Jackie Robinson West, the first all-African-American team to win the championship, could be stripped of its title, as one of its rivals has called for.

""All I can tell you ... is we are meeting [Tuesday] morning with our Charter Committee to discuss this and the findings from our review, which included meetings a week ago with neighboring leagues in Chicago,"" Keener said Monday night by email. ""[I'm] not prepared at this time to commit to anything further. We'll have a statement on the outcome at the appropriate time.""

Jackie Robinson West drew significant attention as it advanced to the tournament's title game, where it fell to Seoul, South Korea. In a sport that increasingly struggles to attract African-Americans, the team representing Chicago's South Side emerged as a force, beating Las Vegas 7-5 in the U.S. title game. The Chicago players were lauded for not just their prowess on the field but also for their sportsmanship, and they later were honored by President Barack Obama at the White House.

But, with reporting from Chicago website DNAinfo.com, the squad has been accused of using players from outside its local area by recruiting players from neighboring Little League districts to build what amounts to a superteam.

Little League embraces policies designed to preserve traditional community-based leagues in which classmates play with classmates, friends with friends. But in 2014, Jackie Robinson West officials reportedly expanded their territory to overlap with neighboring leagues.

Kristi Black, who was president of Nevada's Mountain Ridge Little League when it lost in the U.S. championship game, has asked that Little League to strip Jackie Robinson West of its title. She told ESPN that she is not asking that Las Vegas be declared champions, though.

""It's not a matter of changing the name on the title or the championship,"" Black said. ""The outcome of the game is what it is, and the kids have moved on. For us, it's more of an ethics thing, a matter of doing what's right. Our intention is to not have the next 27 kids put in this position.""

Black said that Little League officials last week requested the boundaries for her local league as well, which she said she provided.

Officials and coaches with Jackie Robinson West have denied any wrongdoing."

Malala and her father have become international advocates for education, after she survived a Taliban attack two years ago. She and Kailash Satyarthi won the 2014 Nobel Peace Prize ""for their struggle against the suppression of children and young people and for the right of all children to education.""

Ziauddin Yousafzai released the letter on the eve of the 300th day of the Nigerian girls' abduction.

Open Letter from Ziauddin Yousafzai to the Parents of Abducted Chibok Girls

Dear parents of the kidnapped schoolgirls of Chibok,

It was this past July when Malala and I sat with you as you shared stories of your brave daughters, shed tears with you, and prayed with you for their safe return. We challenged President Goodluck Jonathan to meet with you, acknowledge your pain, acknowledge the sacrifice your daughters made to achieve an education, and promise his support.

Malala's Mission: 'Bring Back Our Girls, Now and Alive'

How to Help in Effort to Bring Back Kidnapped Nigerian Girls

Malala Yousafzai Describes Moment She Was Shot Point-Blank by Taliban

Seven months later, I say not enough has been done. The world may turn their attention away, but my daughter Malala and I will not forget you nor your children. Like Malala, your children were targeted simply for being girls who love to learn.

Today, Malala and I call on President Goodluck Jonathan to take resolute action and increase the Nigerian government's efforts to bring your daughters home safe and alive. It is his duty and responsibility to ensure the welfare of all Nigerian citizens.

It is up to all of Nigeria and the global community to raise their voices louder and demand your girls be brought home safely.

Education is a pathway to opportunity but every day women and girls face unspeakable challenges in their journeys to a better life. This is why through the Malala Fund, our family has continued to give its funding to support teenage girls in Northern Nigeria to allow them to pursue their education despite the many challenges they face.

When Malala was attacked by extremists for her commitment to education, I struggled to understand such a devastating act of violence. Sadly, these threats are an everyday reality for millions of girls and boys around the world, with the recent attack on a school in my nation of Pakistan being yet another tragic reminder of the risks faced by students and teachers. A school is a sacred place, an institution of growth and learning where no child should ever fear violence or retribution.

The pictures say it all.

There she was, standing side-by-side with her husband as he stepped off Air Force One in Riyadh today, where, during a brief visit, the president offered condolences for the recent death of King Abdullah and met with his successor, King Salman.

The first lady accompanied the president throughout the stay, embodying some of the reforms that her husband is pushing the country to adopt.

Asked about the country's poor human rights record before his trip, Obama told CNN his administration will continue to apply ""steady, consistent pressure.""

""They're going to have to change how they do business,"" he said.

Wearing pants and her head uncovered, Mrs. Obama stood dutifully beside her husband as he shook hands with the Saudi delegation on the airport tarmac this morning and again at Erga Palace on the outskirts of Riyadh.

At times she reached out to shake an occasional hand, but mostly she stood back and offered just a smile.

According to reporters traveling with the president, due to the cultural constraints, the first lady purposely stood slightly behind her husband and waited for a gesture to be made to her by the men in the receiving line. If one of the men initiated a handshake she returned, if not then she simply smiled or nodded politely."

Trey Gowdy, chairman of the House Select Committee on Benghazi, said Tuesday he still intended to summon former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to testify as part of the investigation into the 2012 attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Libya that killed four Americans.

“Every witness who has relevant information needs to be talked to,” Gowdy told reporters after a committee meeting Tuesday.

If he didn’t call Clinton before the committee, Gowdy said, it would be “an incomplete investigation.”

The House Select Committee on Benghazi is charged with delivering the final word on the attack, which has been the subject of an intense political battle.

Several previous Congressional investigations into the attack have found no wrongdoing by U.S. officials, but that has done little to cool the partisan acrimony surrounding the incident on whether the State Department under Clinton’s direction did enough to prevent the attack.

Clinton, who is believed to be moving closer to announcing her bid for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination, has said she would testify. But Democrats believe she should have been already been called and worry that a delay could interfere with her presidential campaign.

Her testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in January 2013 has become a soundtrack for Republican opposition to her candidacy. Her supporters fear another round of testimony would only inflame the partisan debate over the Benghazi attack.

Gowdy told reporters Tuesday that he has been unable to get documents from the State Department pertaining to the attack, which has delayed his call for Clinton to testify. He said the government has been dragging its feet in release emails and other documents.

“I am willing to do it sooner rather than later,” said Gowdy, a South Carolina Republican. “What I am not willing to do is do it in a vacuum where I don’t have access to the documents.”

Rep. Elijah Cummings, the ranking Democrat on the committee, downplayed the criticism over the release of documents. He said Clinton has been willing to testify.

“If the committee wants her to come she is willing to come,” Cummings, D-Md., told reporters. “So if the excuse is that the State Department documents haven’t gotten there, it makes no sense.”"

Boston received a total of 16.2 inches of snow, bringing their seasonal total to 95.7 inches. Currently this winter remains the third snowiest on record for the city to date.

According to Flightaware, more than 400 flights had been cancelled out of Boston Logan International Airport alone. All MBTA services and Amtrak services between the city and Brunswick, Maine, were also suspended.

Boston Mayor Marty Walsh said today he realizes the snow is ""frustrating for everyone.""

""It's getting frustrating for myself,"" he said. ""There's no place to put the snow. Everyone's getting aggravated being in the house. But I ask you to stay calm and stay focused.""

Walsh said the city has spent $32 million so far on this winter's storms -- way over its budget -- with the latest snowfall costing another $7 million.

Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker warned that freezing temperatures and gusty winds will make roads icy and dangerous for travelers during the Presidents Day weekend.

""It's just going to be a very bad day to be on the roads and we would urge everybody to do everything they can to stay off,"" he said.

Baker added that coastal communities were expected to get the worst of the storm.

""The high tide, while it certainly presents minor and moderate flooding issues, is not quite as severe as people anticipated it might be,"" he said. ""The wind gusts along the coast tend to be in the 60 mile-an-hour range at this point, and that does cause us some concern with respect to power outages.""

The storm will clear out Sunday night, but bitter cold temperatures will remain. By early Monday morning, major cities in the Northeast will feel like they are in the -10s and -20s and freezing temperatures will settle in all the way down to the Southeast.

Some of the major cities in the Northeast may see their lowest temperatures in more than a decade.

Another major winter storm will be developing Sunday night and begin to impact parts of the South. Winter Storm Warnings, Watches, and Advisories are in effect from the southern Plains to the mid-Atlantic for this next winter storm on the way.

By Monday morning, dangerous icy conditions are expected from Little Rock, Arkansas, to Memphis, Tennessee, with the storm pushing east from the Tennessee Valley to mid-Atlantic region by Monday evening.

Snowfall accumulations will range from 6 to 12 inches from parts of Missouri to the Delmarva Peninsula. Current forecasts pinpoint eastern Kentucky and parts of the central Appalachians as the area where the highest amounts could fall. Snowfall totals will be in excess of a foot in these locations.

Accumulating ice is a major concern as well, with Interstate 40 in the bulls-eye through Monday night for icy conditions and treacherous travel.

Heading into Tuesday morning, this system will turn north and impact several major cities along interstate 95 including Philadelphia and New York City. At this time, snowfall accumulations have the potential to reach 6 inches through New York City and possibly even southern New England.

Behind this system will come yet another major arctic blast for the second half of the week."

Danish police shot and killed the 22-year-old man early today in a shootout with police in the Noerrebro district of Copenhagen, Danish investigator Joergen Skov told The Associated Press.

He was believed to be responsible for shootings at a free speech event and a synagogue in Copenhagen that officials said were likely inspired by last month's terror attacks in Paris.

According to Copenhagen police, at about 5 a.m., the suspect was returning to an address that was under police surveillance. When officers tried to make contact with the suspect, he shot at them. The officers returned fire, killing him.

Police said they had found an automatic weapon that may have been the one used in the attack at the free speech event, according to the AP.

""Nothing at this point suggests there were other perpetrators"" in the Saturday shootings, Skov said. Police officials said at a news conference Sunday that they knew who the suspect was but have not yet released his identity, only saying he was from Copenhagen.

The first shooting happened about 4 p.m. Saturday at an event titled ""Art, Blasphemy and Freedom of Expression,"" organized by Swedish artist Lars Vilks, who has faced several threats after caricaturing the Prophet Muhammad.

Vilks told Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet that he ""heard some shots. They sounded weak so I didn't think they sounded as gun shots. It was very surreal.""

""I'm not sure how many shots but I'd say about 20 or 30 shots,"" Dennis Myhoff-Brink, who witnessed the attack, told BBC News. ""People panicked of course and ran to the doors. Other people were hiding behind tables they had turned over.""

The 55-year-old victim in that shooting has been identified as filmmaker Finn Noergaard, a man who produced and directed documentaries for Danish television, according to the AP.

Vilks, 68, who was not injured in the shooting, said he believes he was the intended target.

""What other motive could there be? It's possible it was inspired by Charlie Hebdo,"" he told the AP.

""This is not unexpected ... not going to be the last time either,"" Vilks told Swedish newspaper ""Aftonbladet."" ""It could have been a massacre, what if the suspect would have gotten inside the venue... Of course this is a tragedy but it was expected. It would have happened sooner or later.""

""Denmark has been hit by terror,"" Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt said, according to the AP. ""We do not know the motive for the alleged perpetrator's actions, but we know that there are forces that want to hurt Denmark. They want to rebuke our freedom of speech.""

The shooting happened a month after gunmen opened fire on the Charlie Hebdo satirical magazine in Paris, killing 12 people. The magazine had published cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad, angering many Muslims.

In the days that followed, a police officer was killed and four others slain at a kosher grocery store inside the French capital.

Hours after the shooting at the cafe, police said Dan Uzan, a 37-year-old member of Copenhagen's Jewish community, was killed and two police officers were wounded in a shooting outside a synagogue.

Uzan was standing near the entrance when he was shot, acting as a security guard for a Bat Mitzvah party that was taking place inside, according to Copenhagen's main synagogue.

""It is a very sad morning where we all think of the victims and their relatives,"" Thornin-Schmidt said. ""Two innocent people have lost their lives because of a cynical terror action against Denmark.""

House Intelligence Committee ranking member Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., told ABC News that it's ""too early to tell"" if the shootings in Copenhagen were tied to ISIS or al Qaeda.

""We still don't know. Obviously they [the intelligence community] are working with Danish authorities to try to get to the bottom of -- was there an affiliation with al Qaeda or ISIS? Was this self-radicalization? Was this a copycat of what happened in Paris?"" Schiff said. ""It's still too early to tell.""

1zwgvSi,2015-02-11 00:00:00,FAQ About the Authorization for the Use of Military Force to Fight ISIS - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/faq-authorization-military-force-fight-isis/story?id=28894024,"Over the next couple of months, Congress will be debating a new Authorization for the Use of Military Force against ISIS. But unless you are a national security wonk, the odds are that you will not be familiar with the term or its acronym, AUMF.

WHAT IS THE AUMF?

AUMF is the acronym for Authorization for the Use of Military Force. The specific AUMF that Congress will debate will provide the legal authorization for the U.S. military to fight ISIS.

HOW DO YOU PRONOUNCE IT?

You pronounce every letter in the acronym, unlike other acronyms like NASA.

WHY DO YOU NEED AN AUMF?

The War Powers Resolution of 1973 requires the president to notify Congress within 48 hours of ordering U.S. armed forces for a military operation overseas. Those forces cannot operate in a deployed status for more than 60 days. Combat military operations lasting longer than that time frame require a congressional declaration of war or an authorized use of military force. American airstrikes against ISIS began on Aug. 8 and an airstrike campaign in Syria began on Sept. 22. Since then the U.S. has launched 1,900 of the 2,360 coalition airstrikes in both Iraq and Syria.

WHY DO YOU NEED AN AUMF AGAINST ISIS?

Since the start of the airstrike campaign against ISIS, the Obama administration has relied on the AUMF’s from 2001 and 2002 as the legal justification for its airstrikes against ISIS.

The 2001 AUMF passed by Congress in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks authorized “appropriate force” against terrorists who “planned, authorized, committed or aided"" the attacks. That AUMF has been used as the legal justification for American military action against al-Qaeda terrorists anywhere in the world. The 2002 AUMF authorized the use of military force against Saddam Hussein’s Iraq. It is ironic that the administration is relying partially on the 2001 AUMF since in 2013 President Obama said he favored refining the AUMF and ultimately repealing the “AUMF’s mandate.”

WHAT IS IN THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION’S PROPOSED AUMF?

For months there has been bipartisan congressional support for an ISIS-specific AUMF. However, some key members of Congress have wanted the Obama administration to take the lead in proposing what should be in a new AUMF.

The AUMF proposed by the Obama administration contains several main points. It would authorize military operations against ISIS for three years, allow for the limited use of ground troops by not authorizing ""enduring offensive ground combat operations."" It would also repeal the 2002 AUMF that authorized the ground invasion in Iraq, and provide reports every six months on the pace of operations.

The draft language authorizes President Obama ""to use the Armed Forces of the United States as the President determines to be necessary and appropriate against ISIL or associated persons or forces."" It also describes ISIL, also known as ISIS, as a terrorist organization that poses a ""grave threat"" to the U.S. and its allies in the Middle East.

AREN’T THERE ALREADY US TROOPS IN IRAQ?

There are currently 2,630 U.S. military personnel in Iraq. Last summer, the Obama administration sent American troops to Baghdad to augment security at the U.S. embassy as well as a small number of advisers to help the Iraqi military halt ISIS’s advance towards the Iraqi capital.

Since then the White House has authorized the presence in Iraq of as many as 3,100 U.S. military personnel to provide security to American facilities and launch a training and advise mission for the Iraqi military. The Obama administration has repeatedly stated that U.S. personnel sent to Iraq are not combat “boots on the ground” because they will not see frontline combat with Iraqi units. However, senior military commanders have said publicly that Joint Terminal Air Controllers (JTAC’s) may end up paired with Iraqi units to call in airstrikes in complex military operations. The proposed AUMF would enable this limited use of ground forces.

WHY FOR ONLY THREE YEARS?

The proposed AUMF would last only three years. U.S. military officials have projected that the fight against ISIS could take several years, a minimum of three years. This is how long it would take to retrain the Iraqi military so it can defeat ISIS in Iraq as well as train a force of Syrian moderate opposition fighters who could take the fight to ISIS in Syria.

But there is also a political component too as there has been congressional and administration criticism that the 2001 AUMF was too open-ended. Renewing the AUMF three years from now would allow a public debate on how much longer the fight against ISIS should last.

WHAT HAS BEEN THE EARLY REACTION ON CAPITOL HILL?
President Obama’s request is being met with early resistance on Capitol Hill, with critical questions and deep concern from Democrats and Republicans alike. No surprise, given the fierce partisan divide and the hangover of more than a decade of war. Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia and other Democrats say they are troubled by the “breadth and vagueness” of the language involving ground troops. Kaine and others believe there is too much room for mission creep and say they would not support the proposal as it is now. Sen. John McCain and other Republicans say the president’s proposal has the opposite problem: It constricts the commander-in-chief’s flexibility. McCain, Sen. Lindsey Graham and others say they would not support the proposal as it is now. At issue is the interpretation of these five words, which would be prohibited in the AUMF: “enduring offensive ground combat operations.”

HOW LONG WILL THE CONGRESSIONAL DEBATE LAST?
It will certainly last weeks, but could stretch into months.

SO, WHAT’S THE BOTTOM LINE – WILL THE AUMF PASS OR FAIL?
It’s far too early to suggest the authorization will fail. But if it does, the White House has a backup plan: The proposal only seeks to repeal the 2002 AUMF, the original one passed by Congress in 2001 targeting Al Qaeda is still in place and is the basis for the fight already underway against ISIS.

The verdict came after a 19-month-long trial in which Schettino, who had been accused of causing the Jan. 13, 2012 shipwreck near the Italian island of Giglio, was charged with multiple counts of manslaughter and abandoning ship before all 4,200 passengers could be safely evacuated.

As part of the sentence, Schettino will not be allowed to command a ship for five years.

Investigators had harshly criticized Schettino's handling of the crash before and during the trial -- accusing him of bringing the vessel too close to shore when it struck rocks off the Tuscan island, tearing a hole in its side and causing the death of 32 people.

Prosecutors had requested for the maximum sentence of 26 years, but instead got 16 years and one month by the three-judge panel in the city of Grosetto, where the trial took place.

Schettino, 54, did not appear in court as a judge read the verdict.

Lawyers for many of the survivors and victims' families have attached civil suits to the criminal trial as a way to press the court to order Costa Crociere, the Italian cruise company that operated the ship, to pay hefty damages.

The judge did say Schettino and the cruise company had to pay damages and legal fees as part of the guilty, but did not go into specifics.

While insisting Schettino deserves to be convicted, the plaintiffs' lawyers have lamented to the court that no one from the cruise company's upper echelons was put on trial.

Prosecutors had insisted Schettino was a ""reckless idiot"" and asked the judges to convict him and sentence him to 26 years and three months in prison.

Four Concordia crew members and the boat's land-based crisis coordinator were allowed to plea bargain. None is serving prison time.

Hiram Jimenez was seeking damages from an incident that took place at an Applebee’s in Westampton, New Jersey, on March 4, 2010.

According to the ruling by the Superior Court of New Jersey, Jimenez says his steak fajita was served to him in a “sizzling skillet” which was placed “right in front of [him]” by a waitress.

While praying with his brother, Jimenez said he bowed his head “[c]lose to the table” -- then heard a loud sizzling noise, “a pop of noise,” then felt a burning sensation in his left eye and face.

In a panic, Jimenez also “knocked his plate onto his lap” and “pulled something in his right arm” when he tried pushing himself away from the table.

In an incident report with Applebee’s, Jimenez said that he received “several burns to the face, neck, and arms.”

The lawsuit was dismissed by a trial judge because he found that the restaurant “had no duty to war against a danger that is open and obvious.”

Jimenez appealed, but the two New Jersey judges came to the same conclusion.

Jimenez’s attorney, Richard Wiener, could not be reached for comment."

""It's been an incredible opportunity to pilot this wonderful franchise,"" Stewart said at the end of last night's episode. ""Seventeen years is the longest I have ever in my life held a job, by 16 years and five months. ... In my heart, I know it is time for someone else to have that opportunity.""

However, the Comedy Central show wasn't just a starring vehicle for Stewart -- it also launched the careers of many actors and comedians who are household names today.

A few of those people are below:

1. Stephen Colbert: Colbert worked steadily as a TV comedy writer for years before landing at ""The Daily Show With Jon Stewart,"" but it was at that show, where he worked from 1997-2008, that he really made his mark. In 2005, he launched his spin-off show, ""The Colbert Report,"" where he worked until last year. Later this year, he'll take over hosting duties for David Letterman, and launch ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.""

2. Steve Carell: Now an Oscar nominee for his role in ""Foxcatcher,"" Carell began working as a writer and correspondent for ""The Daily Show"" back in 1999. And while he left the show in 2005 for his star-making role in ""The Office,"" he regularly made guest appearances as himself afterward.

3. John Oliver: In 2007, Oliver began writing for ""The Daily Show,"" where he worked until 2013. So, why did he leave? Why, to host his HBO series, ""Last Week Tonight with John Oliver,"" of course.

4. Larry Wilmore: Wilmore began his career by writing for shows including ""In Living Color,"" but worked behind the scenes too, co-creating ""The PJs"" with Eddie Murphy and ""The Bernie Mac Show,"" with the late Bernie Mac.

However, he became a household name as the ""Senior Black Correspondent"" for ""The Daily Show,"" and even landed his own Comedy Central series, ""The Nightly Show,"" which debuted earlier this year.

5. Olivia Munn: Prior to beginning her yearlong stint as a correspondent for ""The Daily Show"" in 2010, Munn acted in shows including ""Greek"" and ""Beyond the Break."" However, bigger roles followed, including an arc on ""New Girl,"" and a starring role in ""The Newsroom.""

6. Ed Helms: From 2002-2009, Helms worked as a correspondent on ""The Daily Show,"" and in 2006, joined Carell in ""The Office."" Soon, he began getting parts in big movies, including a starring role in ""The Hangover"" franchise.

7. Rob Corddry: A correspondent on ""The Daily Show"" for a decade, Corddry went on to score roles in TV series including ""Happy Endings"" and ""Children's Hospital"" and movies including ""Sex Tape"" and ""Hot Tub Time Machine."""

Wilfrido Cardenas Hoffman, 31, faces up to five years in prison after federal prosecutors said he used a voice over IP app to place more than 90 phone calls from his home in Venezuela to 47 telephone numbers in Newtown.

According to court records Hoffman invoked the name of the gunman.

""This is Adam Lanza. I'm gonna [expletive] kill you. You're dead. You're dead. You hear me? You're dead."" In another phone call, Hoffman said: ""This is Adam Lanza. I'm gonna kill you. You're dead. With my machine gun. You're dead [expletive].""

In one instance, court records show Hoffman's call was answered by a 15-year-old high school student, who described Hoffman to investigators as ""creepy and young"" and stated that she was terrified by the threats.

""These threatening calls, just two days after the tragedy, compounded the collective suffering of all of the citizens of Newtown and needlessly stressed law enforcement resources at a critical time,"" US Attorney Deirdre Daly said. ""It is reprehensible criminal conduct.""

Hoffman has been detained for seven months since his arrest at Miami International Airport as he was en route from Mexico to his home country. The defense argued he should be sentenced to time served because he is mentally ill.

""At the time he made the phone calls at issue in this case, there is no question that Mr. Hoffman was suffering from the symptoms of schizophrenia and unmedicated,"" his defense attorney argued in court papers.

That's the question many had when a photo of #TheDress ""broke the Internet"" last week, dividing the majority of users into those who saw white and gold and those who saw black and blue.

But today, the Salvation Army in South Africa is using the question on a new photo Twitter PSA fighting against domestic violence and abuse against women.

The PSA shows a model wearing a gold-and-white edited version of #TheDress. More controversial than #TheDress, though, are the black and blue bruises and cuts covering her body.

Is it so hard 2 see black & blue? 1 in 6 women are victims.

The ad then challenges victim-blaming, saying, ""The only illusion is if you think it was her choice.""

""One in six women are victims of abuse,"" the text continues. ""Stop abuse against women.""

The powerful ad was produced by South African creative agency Ireland/Davenport as a charity piece for the Salvation Army just Thursday.

""We wanted to take advantage of the hype of the meme to spread awareness for something important,"" Ireland/Davenport creative director Wihan Meerhloz told ABC News today. ""Our creative team brainstormed ways to send a greater message about overlooked abuse against women using the dress.""

Meerhloz said he credits team members Caitlyn Goldring and Werner Cloete as the people behind the project literally done in less than a day.

""We thought of the idea, produced it and offered it completely free to the Salvation Army in less than 24 hours,"" he said. ""We hope it takes off on the Internet like the original dress did.""

The PSA had over 1,200 retweets as of this morning, with dozens of positive feedback from Twitter users.

@SalvationArmySA Brilliant campaign. Let's hope it helps stop abuse blindness

@SalvationArmySA @garyadcock Wow. Turned that one around. Powerful re-use of social media.

""Everybody on the Internet, thank you for retweeting, resending and sharing this strong message,"" Meerhloz said. ""Let's keep on going!""

Deah Barakat, 23, a second-year student in UNC's School of Dentistry, married Yusor Mohammad, 21, in December, and Mohammad planned to begin her dental studies in the fall, authorities said. Her sister, Razan Mohammad Abu-Salha, was a sophomore at North Carolina State University.

Gunshots were reported after 5 p.m. in the Finley Forest condominiums in Chapel Hill, east of the University of North Carolina campus, police said.

Namee Barakat, father of victim Deah Barakat, told ABC News from his home in Raleigh that his son was ""always smiling."" He described his son and daughter-in-law, who met as undergrads at N.C. State, as ""bright, intelligent, thoughtful, generous and loving.""

He said Abu-Salah, from Raleigh, was visiting her sister.

A spokesman from the North Carolina State University said Abu-Salha was majoring in design and on the dean's list for the fall 2014 semester. The university spokesman said Barakat and Mohammad were alumnae of the school.

I just saw this photo of the couple killed in the #ChapelHillShooting...heartbreaking pic.twitter.com/2cE4Dh9opV

""It is with great sadness I share with you the news that the three victims of a shooting yesterday evening near the UNC Chapel Hill campus include a current and two former NC State students,"" NC State Chancellor Randy Woodson said in a statement.

Barakat graduated magna cum laude with a B.S. in business administration in May 2013. Yusor Mohammad graduated cum laude with a B.S. in biological sciences in December 2014, school officials said.

Barakat and ten local dentists and faculty from UNC School of Dentistry were planning a trip this summer to Rihaniya, Turkey, to provide dental care to students there, according to his fundraising page. Barakat was featured in a fundraising video to raise money for the trip.

""Deah and Yusor were exemplary students and activists who believed in humanity and helping people in need,"" Dr. Zaher Sahloul, the president of the Syrian American Medical Society, said in a statement. ""Deah and Yusor felt that they had to do their part to help the Syrian people suffering, and fight the apathy of rest of the world. Their remarkable work and lives will never be forgotten.""

The engineer, Steven Smalls, recounted the ill-fated train's final minutes, and how he helped as many as seven people to safety from the burning train, when investigators interviewed him Friday, NTSB vice chairman Robert Sumwalt told reporters.

Smalls told investigators that he made all of the necessary checks before leaving Grand Central Station Tuesday on the evening route, which was his fourth and final run of the day, Sumwalt said.

As the train approached the scene of the crash that was to kill six people and injure at least a dozen, Smalls said he saw what he thought was a reflection at the crossing gate before realizing it was the “front end of a vehicle that was on the edge of the track,” which prompted him to “immediately” pull the emergency brake, Sumwalt added.

When the train hit the car, it was moving at 49 miles per hour, Sumwalt said. Smalls felt the collision and saw the car disappear underneath the front of the train.

He called in the crash on his radio, saying, “Emergency, emergency, emergency!” according to Sumwalt.

Smoke started flowing into the engineer’s compartment and Smalls told investigators he went into the first cabin of the train, helping five or six passengers out before getting out of the car.

""When smoke got too dense he exited the train,"" Sumwalt said.

After exiting, Sumwalt added, Smalls recounted seeing another passenger who was unable to walk crawling towards the door, so Small scooped him out “in a fireman’s pose.”

Additionally, the NSTB investigators met with the train’s conductor today, who was in the sixth car of the eight-car train at the time of the crash. The conductor felt the collision and, after hearing Smalls’ emergency call, made an announcement to passengers over the public address system to confirm the train had hit a car.

Sumwalt detailed the emergency evacuation procedure and told how 12 pieces of 39-foot sections of the third rail piled up in the first cabin of the train after the crash.

Five passengers from inside the train's front cabin died in the crash, as did the driver of the Mercedes SUV that was on the train tracks."
1zXIdrr,2015-02-23 00:00:00,Five Stories You'll Care About in Politics This Week - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/stories-care-politics-week/story?id=29115645,"So, Jeb Bush is his own man, though he loves talking to his dad’s and his brother’s men. Joe Biden loves all men -- and women, of course, too -- particularly those in early-voting states. Whether Elizabeth Warren and Hillary Clinton learn to love each other might be the biggest question of 2016. Rudy Giuliani thinks he knows what the president loves. And Chris Christie is learning more than he wanted about whom Republican donors love.

Here’s a glimpse at some of the stories the ABC News political team will be tracking in the week ahead:

The annual conservative carnival known as CPAC will come together outside Washington and draw the brightest prospects of the Republican Party, along with servings of Donald Trump and Sarah Palin. The Conservative Political Action Conference has historically been an outlet for presidential contenders to show off their stump speeches and burnish their conservative credentials, and all the major 2016ers will be there. CPAC will be the first multi-candidate showcase to feature former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, whose declaration of independence from the Presidents Bush doesn’t change the fact that his brother’s administration isn’t so fondly remembered by some in the conservative movement. Will Bush dare to mention immigration or education, and risk early boos in his quest for 2016?

Wait -- it’s the end of February already? Those comfy two months Republicans carved for themselves to deal with Homeland Security funding have gone by fast, with no real progress in crafting a bill that can actually pass Congress. Republicans calculated that this deadline was the best way to roll back President Obama’s executive order on immigration. But Democrats are standing their ground, and polls suggest Republicans are more likely to shoulder the blame for a partial departmental shutdown. While the consequences wouldn’t necessarily be dire, since so many DHS employees are considered essential, Homeland Security is kind of a bad department to not fund. A federal judge put a stop to the immigration order this past week, potentially giving Republicans an off-ramp from a confrontation they’re not entirely comfortable with. But word that the White House is plotting to get that ruling reversed scrambles even that calculation. Somebody will have to blink, or somebody will have to cut a deal, and fast.

Rudy Giuliani isn’t running for anything, and hasn’t won an election since 1997. But he still knows how to win/lose a news cycle. “I do not believe that the president loves America,” the former New York City mayor declared, prompting days’ worth of sparring with Democrats, and partial walk-backs that may have made things worse for Giuliani. The dust-up evokes memories of the early, birther-infused days of the Obama presidency, and invites uncomfortable questions for 2016ers. The current context is important, too: President Obama is pointedly refusing to call terrorists “Islamic” or “Muslim,” in a semantic decision his critics fear has policy implications. And Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is readying a Washington trip that will expose deep divisions between the U.S. and one of its closest allies on the issue of Iran.

Joe Biden is flirting ... with something. Or else his schedulers are really good at making us think he is -- how else to read a third early-voting-state visit by the vice president in as many weeks? Next on Biden’s tour is a trip Wednesday to New Hampshire to tout the economy, following up on trips to South Carolina and Iowa. It was in Iowa that Biden said Democrats running for president should be “sticking with what works” -- in essence, he said, running for a “third term” of the Obama administration. Biden himself has said he won’t make up his mind on running until summer, but Democrats continue to be restless about the Hillary-or-bust shape their nominating process seems to be taking. While Hillary Clinton herself still stays away from early states, former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley will hit South Carolina on Friday.

Mayor Rahm Emanuel has gone a long way toward righting his own political ship in advance of Tuesday’s mayoral election in Chicago. But his best bet at guaranteeing himself a second term would come by securing an outright majority in this first round of voting, thereby avoiding an April runoff. Polls suggest 50 percent is within reach but by no means guaranteed for Emanuel, despite a tumultuous first term marked by a spike in violence and tensions over schools and pensions. The general thinking is that one of Emanuel’s lesser-known rivals could consolidate frustration with the mayor, given a one-on-one shot in a runoff. President Obama recorded a radio ad for his former chief of staff, and dropped by the mayor’s campaign headquarters this past week with the knowledge that Emanuel doesn’t want to face six more weeks of campaigning."

He's also the son of the iconic Dave Schultz, who won an Olympic Gold Medal in wrestling and was one of the main subjects of the Oscar-nominated film ""Foxcatcher."" On Jan. 26, 1996, Dave Schultz was shot and killed by John du Pont. Mark Ruffalo plays Dave Schultz in the movie, Channing Tatum plays Dave Schultz's brother, Mark Schultz, and Steve Carell stars as du Pont. Alexander Schultz, 28, has used what he learned from his father to inspire others and pave his own path in life. Both Ruffalo and Carell were nominated for an Oscar for their work in this film. This is Alex Schultz's story, as told to ABC News.

Seeing 'Foxcatcher'

That poor sound guy.

I've probably seen ""Foxcatcher"" too many times -- five in all -- but I still remember the first time. They were finalizing the sound on the film and I was there with the editing team and the producers in Los Angeles. And the poor sound guy, I sat right next to him and I was just balling. So, I'm sure he got nothing out of that session. It was a rough watch, but for only the last 10 to 15 minutes.

The first hour and half, I just thought I was watching a really good taping. When it changes to winter, I had to snap back into it. Then I knew the movie was winding down and what was coming -- the murder scene. It's the worst feeling. It was like going back in a time machine, but you can't do anything. You just have to watch. You really feel powerless.

I had spoken about the story so much that I thought I'd be somewhat numb to it. This is probably just an ode to Ruffalo and Carell and their acting, 'cause it was just like a time machine. Ruffalo does an insane job of playing my dad. It's amazing.

You know, it's always hard to make a biopic, but ""Foxcatcher"" is incredibly well done. It's emotional for me, but Bennett Miller did a really good job of getting in all the key aspects of my dad and the story. If you ask who my dad was -- gregarious, kind to everyone, an incredibly talented guy in more than just wrestling, an amazing father -- that was Ruffalo in this movie.

The Right Cast for the Right Movie

Ruffalo, Channing and Carell all just nailed it, and not just onscreen.

First, physically, everyone really put their heart and soul into this. They nailed even the way my dad and uncle walked and their work ethic was just ridiculous. That's something I won't ever forget. Like, Channing is this guy who gets up at 4 a.m., works out, then films for 12 hours and catches another workout. Plus, he was training with world-class wrestlers, so it must have been incredibly intense and humbling. But he's down to wake up and do that everyday.

You have to remember that Channing became the megastar he is today while filming ""Foxcatcher."" I think around that time, he had three movies that all blew up -- ""21 Jump Street,"" ""The Vow"" and ""Magic Mike."" He just got so famous. Still, even with that level of fame, he always made time for me and never changed. He's just a good guy and a real one.

Now, Mark Ruffalo is literally the nicest guy on the planet. He's just only doing good things. He's saving the world one day at a time and helping people. I mean it when I say Ruffalo could have just played himself in ""The Avengers."" Ruffalo and I still talk and email from time to time, and that's just the kind of guy he is.

You can understand why people want to work with these guys. They are just genuine, down-to-earth guys who just happen to be extremely talented actors. If you asked me to form a perfect cast -- on and off the screen -- if it's not ""Foxcacther,"" I don't know what is.

What the Movie Wasn't Able to Show

It must be hard for someone like Bennett Miller to cut someone's story down to 120 minutes. Like my father, Uncle Mark or even du Pont could each have their own movie centered around them. There's three dynamic people there. It was probably tough to decide who to highlight more or whose eyes to show the movie through.

What they weren't able to show in the time frame was how close my father and du Pont were. I remember almost everything from that era. My father loved everyone and always tried to make sure they felt involved. For that reason, I remember DuPont being around a lot. We'd go to his house a bunch and he would come over.

That's one thing not shown in the movie. No negative to the film at all, I mean it. But after Uncle Mark left, it was just my dad and the team. My dad was really John's best friend. They showed him as having this dynamic where my dad would push him away a bit, and he would do that, but only because he was honest with John. He treated him like an adult and not a billionaire. He also was the one guy who would call John over if someone was throwing a barbecue or something.

Instead of just sitting in the corner, my dad would make sure John was good. Other guys were nice to him, but they wouldn't reach out and invite him over.

I think the movie does a really good job of showing why the Schultz family has never been overly mad at du Pont. He's a pretty sympathetic figure. He's just sad. Not rooted in aggressiveness or evil, just a terribly insecure guy who had no friends. Then you throw in a drug problem with an unlimited bank roll and people taking advantage of him. You just end up with a weird, misguided guy with mental health problems.

My Father

My father and I were really close. He may have died when I was 9 years old, but he didn't have a traditional job and that meant he was home a lot when I was a kid. I got to hang out with him and watch him, and I really believe that made me the man I am today. He would go train till 3 p.m. and be home when I got home from school. Me and him were really, really close.

My dad was famous for learning from everyone. He’d go to an event in Russia and talk to everyone about what was working for them, even the janitor. He didn't look down on anyone and he knew some of these other people would see things from a different angle or perspective than he could.

He would always say, ""You can just get gold from anyone,"" no matter of their background.

He was also famous for meeting people, hanging out with them for 30 minutes and they would never know he was an Olympic champion or who he was. He just loved people. He would just talk to them about their job and their life, and he actually cared. There was no facade at all. He was actually interested in you and, because of this, by the end of his life he had all these cool hobbies. He was really good at learning from others. He just opened those doors.

I mean, rock climber, shooting with the national shooting team, he would try anything. He went through his life as a student. That’s always been something I tried to mimic.

My dad’s gone and I’m his representative. That definitely drove me to shoot high. My reasoning, and I think this comes from my dad, is if you aim high, even if you miss by 50 percent, you are probably really in a good place. That drives me to take on big challenges.

I’m driven by what he was able to accomplish. I don’t feel it’s pressure, it’s the right way to live. I saw how happy he was with his life. He’d go after things in a big way. That’s being alive.

My Life Today and Complete App

With that said, I think a lot of my father's ideals are in the Complete app.

We have a billion people on these social networks and it's primarily being used for entertainment value. The interaction is just one-way online. I wanted a community where they didn't just ""like"" something you already accomplished. I wanted support for things you wanted or needed to get done. Everything that happens before you post the news on Facebook.

Like, I needed to get comfortable dress shoes and if it wasn't for friends and people in Complete, I would never have known that Cole Haan had a collaboration with Nike and, apparently, the shoes are super comfortable. Not a plug for Nike or anything, but it's the community through Complete that made this happen, that shared this knowledge with me. Now, I have comfortable dress shoes.

There are three main reasons people stop short of finishing things they want to do -- time and information gathering, need for accountability and support and connection (wanting to hire someone, but also wanting a recommendation first).

1zXrLLp,2015-02-12 00:00:00,President Obama Requests War Powers for Global Fight Against ISIS - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/president-obama-requests-war-powers-global-fight-isis/story?id=28889033,"President Obama formally unveiled his request for legal authorization to fight ISIS in Iraq and Syria, declaring that the ongoing military campaign will succeed in destroying the extremist group.

""Make no mistake this is a difficult mission, and it will remain difficult for some time,"" Obama said in a televised statement from the White House, ""but our coalition is on the offensive and ISIL is on the defensive.""

""ISIL is going to lose,"" he said, flanked by Vice President Joe Biden, Secretary of State John Kerry and outgoing Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel.

Obama said the draft war-powers request would ""strike the necessary balance"" and give him ""flexibility"" to defeat the militants. But he sought to reassure Americans ""it is not the authorization of another ground war like Afghanistan or Iraq.""

While the U.S.-led war against ISIS, also referred to as ISIL, has been underway since August, Obama has sought formal endorsement from Congress to “show the world we are united in our resolve.”

The three-page draft war powers resolution sent to Capitol Hill today declares ISIS a “grave threat” to the national security of the U.S. and its allies. It notes the terror group’s intention to conduct attacks around the globe and a record of “despicable acts of violence,” including the murder of four U.S. citizens -- James Foley, Steven Sotloff, Peter Kassig and Kayla Mueller.

Obama proposes that Congress authorize a military campaign against ISIS for three years, without restrictions on geographic scope. He also wants potential future deployment of U.S. ground combat forces to remain on the table, though the resolution would rule out “enduring offensive ground combat operations.”

In a letter to lawmakers, Obama explained that he wants to retain “flexibility” in the fight, even as he publicly pledges no long-term, large-scale ground war as the U.S. led in Iraq and Afghanistan.

He cited rescue operations, special operations raids, intelligence collection and the need for ground controllers to help guide airstrikes as the limited scenarios that could require U.S. military personnel.

The president also requested cancellation of the 2002 measure authorizing the Iraq War, but does not address the 2001 authorization for the campaign in Afghanistan.

Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle reacted cautiously to terms of the president’s request. Many Democrats have expressed concern that the authorization is too broad, while many Republicans have complained it may be too narrow.

“The delivery of this authorization is the beginning of a legislative process that will involve hearings, markups and I’m sure changes as we go through this process,” House Speaker John Boehner said at a news conference. “I believe that if we’re going to authorize the use of military force, the president should have all the tools necessary to win the fight that we’re in.”

House Democratic leader Rep. Nancy Pelosi stopped short of endorsing Obama’s proposal, saying in a statement that lawmakers should ensure that whatever is voted upon should be “narrowly tailored” to the fight against ISIS.

If and when Congress will vote on a compromise resolution remains unclear. It would be the first war vote in Congress in 13 years, with major implications for coming political campaigns.

Maxxzandra Ford's newborn son, Avery, is the heaviest infant to ever be born at St. Joseph's Women's Hospital in Tampa, Florida, according to the hospital.

Ford, who already has a 1-year-old son and 6-year-old daughter, didn't realize at first she was pregnant, according to St. Joseph's Hospitals spokeswoman Nancy Gay and ABC News affiliate WFTS-TV in Tampa.

Ford's husband recommended she take a pregnancy test after she started to gain weight in the fall, and the test confirmed the pregnancy.

""She knew she gained a lot of weight and thought she might be having twins because she was a twin,"" Gay said.

A doctor figured out that the mother of two was actually 35 weeks along in her pregnancy.

Ford's doctors estimated based on ultrasounds that her son would weigh a hefty 10 pounds, so everyone was surprised when she gave birth to a 14.1-pound baby.

""When I felt his head come out, I knew he was bigger than 10 pounds,"" Ford told WFTS-TV.

Avery was born on Jan. 29 and is expected to get out of the hospital in the next few days. Both mother and son are healthy and doing well, Gay said.

The hefty newborn is still a bit smaller than the largest baby ever born, according to Guinness World Records. In 1879, Ann Bates of Canada gave birth to a newborn who weighed in at a whopping 23 pounds, 12 ounces."
1zy6Uhu,2015-02-03 00:00:00,Why Obama’s Budget Cuts $50 Million From National Vaccine Program - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/obamas-budget-cuts-50-million-national-vaccine-program/story?id=28689193,"President Obama has proposed a $50-million cut to a federal immunization program, citing diminished need for government-funded vaccinations thanks to the Affordable Care Act.

The funding reduction, included in Obama's 2016  budget blueprint released Monday, comes amid a measles outbreak nationwide and growing debate over vaccinations.

The government budgeted $611 million in 2015 for the federal purchase and distribution of vaccines for uninsured children and adults, which is authorized by Section 317 of the Public Health Service Act.

The proposed cut for 2016 is relatively modest, but would reduce the number of immunizations provided free of charge at local, state and national levels.

In an interview Sunday, Obama called on all parents to vaccinate their kids, warning that allowing a segment of the population to remain unvaccinated threatens the safety of everyone.

The White House says the president's proposal to cut immunization funding would not undermine administration and public health efforts nationwide.

""The health insurance expansion will further increase access to immunizations and decrease the number of uninsured and underinsured individuals in need of Section 317 vaccine for routine immunizations,"" explained Melanie Roussell, a spokeswoman for the Office of Management and Budget.

While there are no concrete estimates for how many children have gained coverage under Medicaid or CHIP -- the Children's Health Insurance Program – specifically as a result of the Affordable Care Act, experts say the law has significantly expanded access to the programs for the uninsured and their families.

The rate of uninsured children in America has been cut in half in the past 15 years, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, which estimates 8 percent of U.S. children between the ages of 1 and 18 have no health insurance."

Snow began falling across parts of the Northeast on Sunday morning and became more widespread and heavier throughout the day.

This new storm has the city of Boston in the bulls-eye once again with another set of records on slate to be broken.

So far this season Boston has received more than 55 inches of snow, already above the city's seasonal average of a little more than 40 inches. Just a couple weeks ago, Boston experienced its snowiest week on record, setting the stage for increasing concerns for what to do with all the snow.

Boston Mayor Marty Walsh said the city is running out of places to put all the snow.

""We've never seen this type of snow here in the city of Boston, any other time in the history of our city,"" he said.

As of early Sunday evening, more than a half foot of snow was already reported in parts of Vermont with snow falling from Buffalo to the coast of Maine.

Parts of nine states across the Northeast are currently under Winter Storm Warnings and Advisories, with the snow expected to continue through Sunday night. Throughout the night, a wintry mix will develop for locations along the Pennsylvania and New York state line east to the southern New England Coast.

By Monday morning, areas of freezing rain will lead to icy roads closer to Interstate 80 and the heavy snow will continue for areas farther north.

However, throughout the day, colder air will be moving south, likely changing the wintry mix to all snow across the region.

The highest snow amounts are forecast to fall from central New York State to New England with Boston and the surrounding area expected to see the biggest snow totals once again. By Monday night, areas farther south will see some light snow accumulations as well, as the wintry mix changes over to snow even briefly as far south as Philadelphia.

The storm is expected to wrap up by early Tuesday morning with quieter weather expected for the middle of the week."

The report delivered strong criticism of the way Defense Department installations in Afghanistan managed their waste disposal systems -- mistakes which were both expensive and may have exposed U.S. military personnel to significant health risks.

“DOD did not adequately plan for and manage disposal of solid waste at its installations in Afghanistan,” the report reads, calling the approach to waste disposal “haphazard and reactive.”

Throughout its engagement in Afghanistan, U.S. military personnel in the country generated hundreds of tons of solid waste per day, including plastics, food waste, electronic equipment and other products. For years, without proper policies or procedures in place, simple open-air burn pits remained the military’s preferred method for disposing of solid waste.

But the toxic smoke of those open-air burn pits, often contaminated with lead and mercury, posed serious health risks of service members and civilians in their immediate area, SIGAR said. U.S. military personnel returning from Afghanistan complained of health problems, which they said stemmed from exposure to the burn pits on installations.

By August 2010, 251 of these open-air burn pits were in operation on U.S. military bases, according to the SIGAR report.

New regulations from U.S. Central Command ordered long-term military bases to install alternative methods, such as incinerators, to provide a safer way of disposing of waste. The military spent over $81 million to install 23 incinerator systems at nine military installations in Afghanistan.

But the SIGAR report said four military bases—FOB Salerno, FOB Sharana, FOB Ghazni and FOB Maywand—never used their eight incinerators, which cost $20.1 million to build. At one of those bases, FOB Sharana, a design error left the loading area too narrow to even allow forklifts to deposit waste in the 40-ton capacity incinerator. FOB Sharana officials decided to continue using open-air burn pits.

“Given the fact that DOD has been aware for many years of the significant health risks associated with open-air burn pits, it is indefensible that U.S. military personnel, who are already at risk of serious injury and death when fighting the enemy, were put at further risk from the potentially harmful emissions from the use of open-air burn pits,” said John F. Sopko, the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction in an introductory letter to the report.

The report also strongly criticized the management of contracts for the construction and maintenance of the incinerators.

“[W]e found occasions where contractors were paid the full contract amount, even though they failed to perform in accordance with contract requirements,” the report reads.

The report found that incinerators at FOB Salerno and FOB Sharana had major deficiencies when they were transferred to the bases. The report states that in both of those cases, the Defense Department paid the contractors the full amount, approximately $10.4 million, without the deficiencies being corrected."

Binh and Phuoc Wagner, 3, of Ontario, Canada, both need liver transplants because of a genetic condition called Alagille syndrome, which can affect bile ducts in the liver and lead to severe liver damage.

The twins were adopted in from Vietnam in 2012 by Johanne and Michael Wagner, who were aware the girls’ livers were in trouble during the adoption.

“We knew they were very ill,” Johanne Wagner said. “Those girls knocked on our doors and they were supposed to be with us, and it just took a different path. As soon as we heard about them, we knew they were they were part of our family.”

Wagner can only give liver tissue to one child because of the way the liver regenerates. Doctors will determine which girl is sicker and she will undergo the procedure.

“We found ourselves to be very lucky that we qualified right away,” said Johanne Wager of her husband being a match. “[We’re] relieved but we need one more donor.”

The family has now turned to social media and public outreach in the hope that a stranger could be a match and also be willing to undergo a rigorous medical procedures and an operation in order to save their daughter’s life.

After starting a Facebook page to draw attention to the twins' story, Johanne Wagner said hundreds of people started flooding her Facebook page offering to be a living donor. Wagner is directing anyone interested to the Toronto General Hospital Living Donor Assessment Office to see if they fit the profile.

Dr. Les Lilly, the medical director of liver transplant at Toronto General Hospital, estimated that anonymous living donors account for a fraction of liver donations, but that with social media the practice could become more commonplace.

“We do have people who step forward and want to help out, and they’re considered anonymous donors,” said Lilly. “I think there’s a greater awareness,” of being a living donor through social media.

Lilly cautioned that becoming a living donor is not easy. A person’s blood type must be compatible with the recipient and they must pass a battery of tests to ensure they are healthy enough to donate. After the operation, they have to be out of work for weeks as they recover.

Lilly said hospital officials go slowly with tests so that donors are not overwhelmed and feel they still can change their minds.

“We’re very, very conscious of donor safety,” said Lilly. “We realize some people might go into process very enthusiastically,” but later decide it is not right for them.

Billie Potkonjak, director of health promotion and patient services at the Canadian Liver Foundation, said they’re seeing more and more anonymous living liver donor cases.

“Certainly, the proliferation of social media makes it easier for people to go public with their situation and to talk about it publicly,” said Potkonjak. “It definitely highlights the need for organ donation.”

Johanne Wagner said it’s likely her husband will donate his liver to one of the girls within the next few weeks.

In spite of the difficulties they’re facing, Johanne Wagner said they’re staying positive and thankful for the public’s support.

“We would travel this road all over again,” she said."

Simmons Opens Up About His Sentimental Acceptance Speech - ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/oscars-2015-jk-simmons-opens-sentimental-acceptance-speech/story?id=29149737,"J.K. Simmons started the Oscars off on a sentimental note by thanking his family during his acceptance speech for Best Supporting Actor.

The ""Whiplash"" star told reporters backstage that he didn't expect his words to make such an impression.

""I was somewhat taken aback by the response from people that I don't know,"" he said. ""I said most of what I wanted to say. ... I never go up there scripted really, so most of it came out.""

Simmons, 60, opened up about his career, admitting that the ""lean times were a wonderful and beautiful part of my life,"" and reflected that he looks back on doing regional theater for little money with ""great fondness."" However, winning an Oscar was also pretty great.

""Maybe more people saw me tonight than see me in the [insurance] commercials for the first time!"" he said. ""This is the cherry on top of this extraordinary experience that 'Whiplash' has been for me."""

Kinder Morgan (KMI) said Wednesday that it will buy Hamm's company Hiland, which owns gas and oil pipelines and plants primarily in North Dakota's Baaken oil field. It expects to finalize the sale in the next three months.
Hamm has lost nearly half his wealth in the past six months, thanks to the dramatic drop in oil prices that crushed the value of his other oil company, Continental Resources, Inc (CLR). That brings his net worth down to $9.3 billion, according to Wealth-X, a wealth tracking company.

His wallet has also been hit by a very public and expensive divorce that is costing him another $1 billion. His ex, Sue Ann Arnall, has already cashed his check for the full amount, but is appealing the judge's ruling. She says she's entitled to more.
Hamm has also appealed, claiming that he can no longer afford the $1 billion settlement because of the declining value of his company. He recently secured a personal loan, using shares of Continental Resources as collateral. It's unclear how much the loan is for.
Hamm's lawyer would not comment for this story.

It's a phone scam.
In fact, it tops the IRS ""Dirty Dozen"" list of tax scams this year, and it's been surging in recent months, the agency said Thursday.
The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA), which oversees the IRS, has received reports of 290,000 scam calls since October 2013 and said nearly 3,000 victims have been swindled out of $14 million so far.
By altering their caller ID number to make it look like they're calling from an IRS office, these scammers often threaten vulnerable people like the elderly and new immigrants with things like arrest, deportation or the loss of their driver's license if they don't pay immediately for money purportedly owed.

Often leaving messages that say it's ""urgent"" you call them back, the scammers use common names and sometimes say they are from the IRS Criminal Division. They may even claim to know the last four digits of your Social Security number and send follow-up emails that appear to be from the IRS, TIGTA said.
They often demand that payments be made by prepaid debit card.
Once they make their threats, the scammers have been known to call back and again disguise their caller ID so it appears they are calling from the police department or the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV).
Or sometimes when they call, they may say you have a refund due and ask you to provide personal information so you can claim it.
The real IRS will usually contact you by regular mail first, if it needs to contact you at all. And the agency never demands immediate payment by phone or asks for credit card or debit numbers if they do call. It also never asks for personal or financial information by email, text or social media.
If you get what you suspect is a scam call, report it to TIGTA through its Web site or call 800-366-4484.

2015-02-01 07:21:24,"Super Bowl advertisers 'are on trial' - Feb. 1, 2015 ",http://money.cnn.com/2015/02/01/media/super-bowl-ad-review/index.html,"Defying a stereotype of beer-soaked, sex-saturated ads, this year's crop of Super Bowl commercials were by turns triumphant and thoughtful, and at times even downright somber.
There were babies, dads, dogs, celebrities, athletes, and more babies. But there was also a minute-long message about domestic violence and a dead child who ""couldn't grow up.""
The provocative messages were meant to stand out from the dozens of other spots competing for attention. They might have made for a few awkward moments at viewing parties, but there were still plenty of ads that elicited smiles.
Well-received spots included Budweiser's ""Lost Dog"" commercial; BMW's humorous ad with Katie Couric and Bryant Gumbel; and a serious Coca Cola ad rebuking Internet ""haters."" Other hits included a throw-back Snickers ad starring Danny Trejo and Steve Buscemi and an almost universally praised Dodge ad featuring senior citizens.

For the companies, Sunday was a $4.5 million moment. Months of planning and weeks of promotion culminated in 15 to 60 seconds in front of more than 100 million viewers -- and those viewers instantly delivered their verdicts via the Internet.
""Advertisers are on trial via social media,"" said media strategist Shari Anne Brill.
Companies facing negative reviews on Sunday night -- but still lots of chatter about their ads -- included Nationwide Insurance, T-Mobile and GoDaddy.
Nationwide's ad showed a boy speaking about the life he would have lived, had he not been killed in an accident.
""I'll never learn how to ride a bike. Or get cooties!"" the character said.
""That Nationwide ad just knocked me off my chair,"" CNNMoney's Frank Pallotta tweeted.
As criticism mounted on Sunday night, Nationwide felt compelled to issue a statement: ""The sole purpose of this message was to start a conversation, not sell insurance.""
The conversation Nationwide wanted to start was about how ""preventable injuries around the home are the leading cause of childhood deaths in America.""
Instead, the boy became a meme even before halftime.
""The second I see a kid in one of these commercials I immediately assume they're going to die. Thanks, Nationwide!"" comedian Patton Oswalt tweeted.

Paying an average of $4.5 million for 30 seconds of air time, advertisers during the four quarters of the Super Bowl faced extraordinarily high stakes. (And that's just the price paid to NBC -- companies pay huge amounts of money to get the ads produced.)
""There were a lot of tear-jerkers during the game, including Budweiser's puppy ad, Microsoft (boy with prosthetics) and Nationwide (childhood deaths),"" said Sean Muller, the CEO of iSpot.tv, which tracked online reaction to the ads.
""This had a lot of people begging for more funny ads, which seemed to be more absent this year -- though FiatUSA, Doritos, Skittles and Avocados of Mexico (yes, avocados!) were hits among funny ads.""
One ad right before kickoff that drew immediate commentary: a spot by Chevrolet about the wireless Internet capabilities of its Colorado trucks. ""Chevy trucks advertising 4G LTE instead of driving through gratuitous mud. The world has truly gone tech,"" Mashable chief strategy officer Adam Ostrow wrote on Twitter.
There were also two commercials for mobile games, and for the first time, Snapchat showed up in an ad.
The all-important first ad position after kick-off belonged to Toyota, (TM) which had a feel-good spot starring Paralympic athlete Amy Purdy.
Some advertisers tried to capitalize on their multi-million-dollar investment by releasing their ads days ahead of time -- prompting speculation that this reduced game day anticipation.
Muller said ""the volume of pre-releases/teasers"" was definitely different this year.
Some advertisers, he said, used Facebook's relatively new video features to get attention, ""driving up viewing and social activity significantly.""
But ""the volume of views and activity on Facebook appears to be an additive, meaning it's not taking away from activity on other platforms,"" like YouTube, Muller said. ""And secondly, some brands aren't utilizing it yet -- I suspect that will change next year.""
A high number of ads had social messages, including Procter & Gamble's ""Like A Girl"" ad that challenged gender norms, and Coca Cola's ad encouraging happy Internet communications.
""We can't solve negativity on the Internet, but we can use the world's biggest advertising stage to ask people to think twice before posting negative messages and images,"" Jennifer Healan, the company's group director of integrated marketing content, said in a statement. ""We hoped to inspire Americans to help make the Internet a more inclusive, happier place.""
Perhaps the most thought-provoking ad of the game was the one commissioned by the NFL for its ""No More"" initiative, intended to stop domestic violence and sexual assault.
""The spot, which features a woman calling 911 and pretending to order a pizza because her husband is in the room, is based on a real 911 call,"" said the ad blog Spot Bowl, which called it a ""game-changer.""
It said the NFL was giving over ""some of the airtime it normally reserves for light-hearted self promos"" for the PSA.
Brill, a former executive at the ad agency Carat, noted that the NFL says it is contributing $5 million per year for the next five years to the National Domestic Violence hotline.
""It's about time,"" she said."

Move to Arkansas. The bar is much lower there.
It only takes $228,298 to get into the upper echelon in Arkansas, according to a report from the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute.
But in Connecticut, which has the highest threshold, it takes $677,608 to make it into that elite group. Researchers looked at IRS data for 2012 tax returns by state.
The Top 1% has been pulling away from the rest of the country as their incomes skyrocket. The trend is even more pronounced in certain states.
In 16 states, they captured all the income growth between 2009 and 2012. In another 22 states, more than half the income gains went to those highest on the income ladder.
Only West Virginia saw the income of the Top 1% decline, while that of the Bottom 99% increased.
Connecticut has the widest spread between the average income for the Top 1% and the average income for the rest of the state. They make 51 times that of the rest of their neighbors ($2.7 million vs. $52,600). On the flip side, Hawaii has the narrowest spread at only 14.6.
The Northeast generally has the biggest gap between the Top 1% and everyone else, thanks to the prominence of the financial industry in the New York metro area. The Midwest, meanwhile, has long had a smaller differential, possibly due to the strength of unions in the manufacturing industries there.

The Seahawks head to the Super Bowl for the second year in a row. This year they face off against the New England Patriots which are owned by Robert Kraft, who has a net worth of $4 billion, making him the sixth richest owner in the NFL.

Allen helped Bill Gates start Microsoft when both were students at Harvard, and left the company with a chunk of its then privately-held stock in 1983 which translated in to the bulk of his wealth. Allen also made about $2 billion from the appreciation in value of the Seahawks and the NBA's Portland Trail Blazers, both of which he bought decades ago.

By contrast, Patriots owner Robert Kraft made most of his $4 billion fortune in football. He bought his team for a reported $172 million in 1994, and today it's worth an estimated $2.6 billion.

The workers had been paid $19.28 an hour, which is roughly $9 an hour less than what veteran autoworkers receive.
The United Auto Workers union agreed to the entry-level wage for new hires as part of the 2007 labor negotiations, when Ford (F), General Motors (GM) and Chrysler Group were all losing money.
The Detroit automakers were having trouble competing with lower paid nonunion U.S. plants of foreign automakers such as Toyota (TM) and Honda (HMC).
The two-tier wage structure let the union give the companies some relief without requiring existing members to take pay cuts.
At first there were few workers at the lower wage since the automakers were cutting jobs rather than hiring. But after the federal bailouts and bankruptcy reorganization of GM and Chrysler in 2009, things started to turn around in the industry as car sales rebounded.
A 2011 labor deal kept the two tiers but capped the number of workers at the lower wages. Ford has been adding jobs since then and now has more than 14,000 workers at the entry level wage, according to a report on a UAW's Web site.
With normal attrition and plans announced Tuesday to hire an additional 1,550 workers to meet demand for the new F-150 pickup truck, Ford said it will be raising the pay of 300 to 500 workers at some time in the first quarter.
This will be the first group of entry-level workers promoted to the traditional wage.
Ford said the two-tier wages enabled the automaker to invest more than $6.2 billion in its U.S. manufacturing facilities in the last three years and hire more than 15,000 workers.
The contracts between the UAW and the Detroit automakers are due to expire later this year and the UAW officials are already on record as saying they will seek to eliminate the two-tier wage structure in the next labor deal, bringing all the entry level workers up to the veteran pay scale.
Even Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCAM) CEO Sergio Marchionne said he believes the entry level tier should be eliminated.
""There can't be two classes for people who do the same work,"" Marchionne told reporters at the Detroit auto show last month, according to numerous reports. ""It's impossible. It's almost offensive."""

The information stolen from the insurance giant includes names, birthdays, medical IDs, social security numbers, street addresses, e-mail addresses and employment information, including income data.
Anthem said there is no evidence that credit card or medical information was compromised. While damage is still being assessed, the compromised database contained up to 80 million customer records.
Formerly known as Wellpoint, Anthem (ANTM) is the second-largest health insurer in the United States. The company operates plans including Anthem Blue Cross, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield Amerigroup and Healthlink.
Related: What hackers know about you
Although some news reports have linked the hack to the Chinese government, law enforcement sources and private security firms told CNN it's too early to tell.
Anthem pledged to individually notify current and former customers if their data has been stolen, and by late Wednesday evening, some members reported receiving e-mails from the insurer informing them of the breach. Anthem will offer free credit monitoring and identity protection services to affected customers.
""Anthem's own associates' personal information -- including my own -- was accessed during this security breach. We join you in your concern and frustration, and I assure you that we are working around the clock to do everything we can to further secure your data,"" CEO Joseph Swedish said in a letter to customers.
Anthem said the breach resulted from a ""very sophisticated external cyber attack,"" and that law enforcement agencies were still working to identify the perpetrator. The company has retained Mandiant, a leading cybersecurity firm, to help in the investigation.
The insurer is the latest in a series of companies to suffer severe data breaches. Last year, hackers obtained credit card data for 40 million Target shoppers, as well as personal information -- including names, addresses, phone numbers and e-mail addresses -- for 70 million customers.
Records have also been stolen from Neiman Marcus, JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Experian, eBay (EBAY, Tech30) and Home Depot (HD).
Related: Why should we trust the Sony PlayStation Network ever again?
The Federal Bureau of investigation said that it was aware of the intrusion, and it's investigating the matter. The agency also praised Anthem's decision to quickly address the breach.
""Anthem's initial response in promptly notifying the FBI after observing suspicious network activity is a model for other companies and organizations facing similar circumstances,"" the FBI said. ""Speed matters when notifying law enforcement of an intrusion.""
What to do if you're a customer: If you have Anthem insurance, there's not much you can do but sit tight for now. Anthem has set up a website, anthemfacts.com, with information about the hack.
In the next few weeks, Anthem will inform you by mail if your information was compromised. All impacted Anthem customers will receive some form of identity fraud protection, the company said.
E-mail addresses might have been stolen, but Anthem has not indicated that passwords were taken as part of the hack. You might want to consider changing your Anthem password, just to be safe. If you are concerned that your Anthem e-mail and password combination could have also been used to login to another service, you should change those passwords as well.
All Anthem customers should be on alert for scams. Hackers can use the information stolen from your account to impersonate you or your friends and family.

Anonymous declared war against Islamic extremists last month, saying in a YouTube video that they would track down their websites and social media networks and take them down.
In a new video posted Friday, Anonymous sent another warning to ISIS: ""You will be treated like a virus, and we are the cure. We own the Internet.""
Checks by CNNMoney found the vast majority of Twitter accounts mentioned by Anonymous were displaying a message saying they had been suspended or were not available.
Both Twitter and Facebook are known to take down accounts and content that are associated with terrorism, but it can be difficult to keep track of their millions of users. They often rely on complaints from others before making a move.

Zuckerberg's lawyers are calling it extortion.
Mircea Voskerician, a real estate developer who had owned the rights to property adjoining Zuckerberg's backyard in 2012, had planned to start construction on a new mansion, according to court documents. Instead, Voskerician offered to sell his interest in the land so the Facebook (FB, Tech30) CEO could gain more privacy.
Zuckerberg opted to buy the rights, offering about $250,000. Voskerician rejected that deal. After receiving a $4.3 million offer from another developer, Voskerician met with Zuckerberg's financial advisors.
That's when things got messy. At the meeting, Voskerician says he offered Zuckerberg a discount, in exchange for introducing him to his Silicon Valley network of friends and associates and providing referrals to help boost his business.
In the end, Voskerician says he agreed to sell for $1.7 million ""plus [Mr. Zuckerberg's] promises of personal referrals and business promotion activities"" -- promises Voskerician claims Zuckerberg hasn't kept.
Zuckerberg's attorneys say there were never any concrete promises made, and Voskerician is using ""extortive"" measures, according to a Bloomberg report.
If the agreement was made, one could say that a vote of confidence from one of the world's biggest tech leaders is worth almost $3 million.
A trial date in a California state court is scheduled to be set next month. Facebook and an attorney representing Voskerican did not respond to requests for comment.
Clarification: An earlier version of this story said that the developer had sold the property to Mark Zuckerberg. In fact, he had sold his rights to buy that property.

They buy gold because they believe disaster is imminent.
These investors are convinced gold will spike to $10,000 an ounce (it's currently around $1,225) when the U.S. government implodes, said Peter Hug, an executive at metals retailer Kitco.
Hug calls these people ""crazies"" and says they form a substantial amount of the U.S. physical gold market -- at least 25%.
It's no secret that gold has long been viewed as a form of insurance against disaster. The thinking is that even if the financial or political system collapses, gold will still hold value.
The yellow metal is also widely seen as a hedge against inflation and the collapse of the dollar. Those are two things gold bugs have been deeply worried about given the massive amount of money printing the Federal Reserve has done since the Great Recession.
Related: Winklevoss twins say Bitcoin is better than gold
The end-of-the-world trade: Hug's comments at the Inside ETF Conference last month may raise some eyebrows because he is an executive at one of the largest online retailers of precious metals in North America.
These so-called crazy gold provide lots of business for Kitco. He said their influence is most obvious in the market for smaller units of physical gold between one and 32 ounces.
""These investors buy the metal and it just disappears. It goes under their mattress. They want to use it when the world ends,"" Hug told CNNMoney.
Related: Tim Geithner says Europe may be in worse spot than Japan
Irrational fears or smart safeguards? Peter Schiff, an outspoken gold investors for years, said this characterization of gold buyers is unfair.
""The fears of an economic collapse in the United States are not irrational. I think it's more irrational when people are complacent that nothing can go wrong,"" Schiff told CNNMoney.
It's tough to second guess those who bet on gold before the meltdown of Lehman Brothers in September 2008. Prices spiked from around $800 an ounce in late 2007 to more than $1,800 in 2011 as central bankers raced to stabilize the financial system and get out of the Great Recession.
Where's the hyperinflation? Yet inflation remains nonexistent. Heck, deflation is more of a concern right now in many parts of the world. That's partially why gold has dipped to under $1,250 an ounce today.
Schiff concedes that some people are so paranoid that they own nothing but physical gold.
""That is being too fearful and maybe obsessed with it. But is that any less rational than the person who owns no gold whatsoever?"" he asked.
Schiff said his brokerage firm, which sells physical gold for delivery, recommends people have 5% to 15% of their investment portfolio in physical gold.
Related: Gold is sexy again
Playing the fear card: Hug, a Canadian, said the fear trade is far more common in the U.S. than it is north of the border. This could partially be because Canada's financial system is viewed as less risky than Wall Street and experienced far less stress in 2008.
""You can't play the fear card if you're a dealer or a speaker as well in Canada as you can in the United States,"" he said.

2015-02-06 06:42:53,"The 3 places where Facebook censors you the most - Feb. 6, 2015 ",http://money.cnn.com/2015/02/06/technology/facebook-censorship/index.html,"In certain countries, Facebook is faced with a draconian dilemma: censor your posts or the company gets banned.
Consistently, it decides to censor.
This isn't about your photos or public messages violating Facebook's own rules, like posting pornography. This is Facebook (FB, Tech30) acting as a government censor on that country's behalf.
It's worst in India, Turkey and Pakistan, where thousands of pages and photos get pulled down every year for ""blasphemy,"" criticizing the government or posting something that's religiously offensive.
In the first half of last year, Facebook blocked nearly 5,000 ""pieces of content"" in India. There were nearly 2,000 taken down in Turkey and close to the same number in Pakistan.
You can still see those photos and comments outside of those countries. But they're nonexistent back home. It's selective blocking.
This information comes from Facebook itself, which keeps a running record on its public ""Government Requests Report"" website.
A recent incident in Turkey serves as an example of how this works. Following court orders in Turkey last week, Facebook blocked pages depicting the Muslim religious figure Mohammed.
It's not just developing nations that request Facebook to block access to posts. The list of places in which Facebook engages in this type of censorship includes nations typically viewed as more progressive: France, Germany and the United Kingdom.
Facebook generally portrays itself as a company that defends a user's ability to speak freely. In 2012, CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote to investors that the social media platform will help people's voices ""increase in number and volume"" and pressure political leaders to side with free speech.
And he specifically addressed the topic of Facebook playing government censor at a public question-and-answer session in BogotÃ¡, Colombia last month.
""We want to give as many people as possible the ability to express as much as possible,"" Zuckerberg asserted -- but its free speech crusade only goes so far.
Zuckerberg said that when Facebook faces an ultimatum, it usually decides to abide by laws, even if they're oppressive. But it doesn't bow easily. Facebook's lawyers will fight and review every government demand carefully -- dragging their feet, and only narrowly abiding by a government's specific order.
For example, take the Russian government's arrest of Kremlin critic Alexey Navalny. The government demanded that Facebook take down an event page for a massive rally for Navalny. Facebook pushed back and eventually took it down -- but it kept up all the other copycat rally event pages.
""It becomes a very tricky calculus,"" Zuckerberg said. ""I can't think of many examples in history where a company not operating or shutting down in a country in protest of a law like that who's actually changed the law.""
Instead, Facebook wants to play the long game. The way Zuckerberg framed it: If it has to censor a little, but Facebook still increases communication over all, there's a net win. It's the same argument that's made when people say more liberal nations -- like the United States -- should do business with Cuba and China rather than shun them. Sure, more trade supports an oppressive regime, but there's hope that democracy and capitalism will spill over and help them in the long run.
But is Facebook just choosing money over morals?
In BogotÃ¡, Zuckerberg asserted that ""this is really about our mission and our philosophy, not... some short-term business decision.""
But the company's message to investors says otherwise. In company filings with the Security and Exchange Commission last year, Facebook notes that it abides by local laws because the alternative -- getting banned outright -- ""could substantially harm our business and financial results."" If Facebook disappears in that country, a competitor will just swoop in and take its place.
And the pressure is on. In quarterly reports, India is repeatedly referred to as one of the ""key sources of mobile growth."" Facebook is only used by 10% of that country's 1.2 billion people. The space to grow is equivalent to three whole United States of America.
Why not take a stand? If you look at the number of Facebook users by country, nearly half of Turkey's 81 million people use it. Does Facebook really think the Turkish government can ban a service used by 38 million people and get away with it?
Actually, yes. Facebook pointed out to CNNMoney that Turkey already blocked Twitter and YouTube earlier this year. The threat is real.
So, until something changes, at a government's request Facebook will continue to silence Turks if they make fun of the nation's founder, Mustafa Kemal AtatÃ¼rk. And if Pakistanis point out the cozy relationship between the politicians and militant Islamist groups. And if Indians criticize a religion or the government.

2015-02-12 05:41:53,"Recreational pot delivers $53 million in tax revenue to Colorado - Feb. 12, 2015 ",http://money.cnn.com/2015/02/12/news/economy/colorado-marijuana-tax-revenue/index.html,"It's been a year since Colorado became the first state in the nation to allow people to sell and buy pot legally in January 2014.
And the state took in $53 million in tax revenue as a result.
Colorado made pot legal for everyone, not just medical patients, but it also slapped a 28% tax rate on sales.
While $53 million isn't anything to sniff at, it's not as much of a windfall as everyone was hoping for.
""It's definitely lower than expected,"" said Phyllis Resnick, an economist at Colorado State University.
Most projections were made for the state's full fiscal year, which runs from July through June. When voters approved the legalization of pot, the state estimated it would bring in more than $70 million from July 2014 to June 2015. But it's currently on track to be less than that.
The projections were off for several reasons.
Related: New bank could save the pot industry
Economists overestimated the number of people who would stop buying pot on the black market. The sticking point: Legal pot costs a lot more than illegal pot -- mostly because of taxes and fees. That made fewer inclined to go legit.
They also overestimated the number of medical patients that would switch to recreational marijuana, which is less of a hassle. But medical weed is taxed at a much lower rate -- just 2.9%, which makes it more appealing. Those taxes brought in $16 million for the state in the past year on top of the $53 million from recreational.
Medical marijuana cards expire every year, and not everyone will have theirs renewed, says Resnick. That could push more people into the recreational market.
Even if tax revenue meets the $70 million projection come July, that's still just a drop in the bucket when considering the state's total budget of $27 billion."
2015-02-11 04:11:43,"Powerball's $500 million? An exaggeration - Feb. 11, 2015 ",http://money.cnn.com/2015/02/11/news/companies/powerball-lottery-prize/index.html,"The likelihood of someone winning $500 million in Powerball lottery tonight is very slim.
And that's not just because of the odds of winning are 175 million to one.
It's because the jackpot is actually $338 million for any winner who decides to take a lump sum payment. That's the amount before taxes. And almost all winners opt for the lump sum.
The jackpot would be $500 million only if the winner opts for a 29-year payout.
(The winnings numbers were 11-13-25-39-54. The Powerball was 19 and the Power Play was 3. A lottery official said three winning tickets were sold in Texas, North Carolina and Puerto Rico.)
Related: Shark attacks and asteroid strikes - better odds than winning the lottery
The larger price amount includes the interest that accumulates from the prize money that is invested over the payout period of 29 years.
However, the lotteries always advertise the larger amount.
Terry Rich, president of the North American Association of State and Provincial Lotteries, says it would confuse people if they were to advertise both the amounts.
He also disputes that sales would be hurt if the smaller cash prize were advertised.
Related: The lottery game that's bigger than Powerball
Rich himself admits he wouldn't take the annuity payment, given today's low interest rates.
When interest rates are higher payouts are larger. In 2006, when rates were a lot higher, Wednesday's $500 million Powerball jackpot would have been worth $765 million, a record.
Vinh Nguyen, who bought a winning Powerball ticket in September in San Mateo, Calif., did take the $228 million annuity prize. But he was one of the rare ones to choose that option.
Out of the hundreds of winners, there have been only five Powerball or MegaMillions winners in the last seven years to chose the larger, but deferred, jackpot.
There is one argument for choosing annuity payments -- you can't blow all the winnings as fast.
There have been numerous stories of lottery winners who blew through their winnings only to end up paupers just a few years later.
There was one widely reported story of Andrew ""Jack"" Whittaker of West Virginia, who took a $170 million lump sum in 2002. But he was robbed often, including one time when he had a brief case full of cash stolen from him at a strip club. Today he is 68 years old and still having to work, and says he wishes he had taken the annuity payments.

2015-02-17 08:33:34,"Jose Antonio Vargas partners with Los Angeles Times - Feb. 17, 2015 ",http://money.cnn.com/2015/02/17/media/jose-antonio-vargas-los-angeles-times/index.html,"Jose Antonio Vargas, a journalist and undocumented immigrant, is joining forces with the Los Angeles Times to create a new section of the Times web site devoted to race, immigration and multiculturalism.
The partnership will be called #EmergingUS and, in an unusual arrangement for a newspaper, it will be shared between the Times and Vargas.
Austin Beutner, the publisher and CEO of the Times, said #EmergingUS is the first of several ""verticals"" of news coverage the newspaper will establish in the months to come.
He cited the New York Times' DealBook section of mergers and acquisitions coverage and Politico's coverage of Washington as two examples of the approach he'd like to take.
The name of the venture announced on Tuesday can be read two ways: as ""Emerging Us"" or ""Emerging U.S."" for the United States.
Vargas said it is ""a multimedia platform that, through articles, original videos, shareable data and graphics, will focus on the intersection of race, immigration and identity and the complexities of multiculturalism.""
Race isn't just about white and black, he and Beutner said, and immigration isn't just about the border. The new venture will try to capture those complexities.
#EmergingUS will exist primarily on the web, but some of the work will eventually appear in the newspaper as well. The venture will produce videos and hold events.
Since being appointed the publisher last August, Beutner, a former investment banker, has spoken of ""unburdening"" his journalists from print formats.
The Times' web traffic shows ""really high engagement"" at the 100-word level and the 1,000-to-2,000-plus-word level, he said.
""You find the dead zone in the middle, 500-700 words. That form factor, which exists in many newspapers, doesn't exist because Steve Coll and the Columbia Journalism School thinks 500-700 words is the best form factor. It's because five of those stories fit on a printed page. So we're unburdening our journalists from that format.""
Journalist is a key word. While Vargas has been an immigrant activist for several years, he has been a writer and reporter for more than a decade, and he said #EmergingUS ""utilizes every skill I have"" from those jobs.
In 2008, while at The Washington Post, he was part of a team that won a Pulitzer Prize for breaking news reporting.
Vargas moved to The Huffington Post in 2009. After he revealed his undocumented status in a 2011 essay for The New York Times Magazine, he created a nonprofit group called Define American aimed at ""elevating the conversation"" about immigration.
The group sought to share stories from contributors who are undocumented, thereby attaching sympathetic faces to the fractious immigration debate.
Related: Jose Antonio Vargas: Why I made 'Documented'
Vargas also directed and starred in a documentary about his experience, ""Documented,"" which was televised by CNN last year. He is now working on another documentary, this one for MTV, about whiteness.
Stephen Friedman, the president of MTV, said it will premiere sometime this spring or summer.
""Jose has been very open about being undocumented and being -- both as a person of color, a person who's openly gay -- constantly questioned on his status and what it means,"" Friedman said.
Because Vargas lacks citizenship, ""it has been a unique challenge to figure out, legally, how we all make it work,"" Friedman acknowledged.
He said MTV looked to CNN as a model. (CNN, which is the parent of this web site, acquired ""Documented"" from Vargas's production company.)
Similarly, The Los Angeles Times can't hire Vargas directly, ""but we can become a business partner with him,"" Beutner said. ""So that's what we've chosen to do.""
#EmergingUS will include other staff members, some of whom may work directly for Vargas's production company.
Vargas declined to comment on the ownership structure of the venture, but said ""if #EmergingUS does well, then I do well.""
Beutner emphasized that Vargas is coming on board as a journalist, not an activist.
""The point of view"" of the venture, he said, ""is that this is an important topic to be talked about. It's not meant to be advocacy, and it won't be advocacy. But the mere fact that we're telling more stories will change, we think, the way people view the topic."""

In Apple's next update of emoji icons, a number of the tiny cartoon people are now available in six different skin tones.
The male and female faces, as well as thumbs up/thumbs down icons, will be available in the different colors. Other people emoji, such as princesses and construction workers, will also get more diverse options. Tapping and holding on an emoji person will bring up the new skin-tone variations.
Black emojis are coming
The diverse people are just some of the 300 new emojis included in the latest developer version of iOS 8.3. The new icons won't be available to the public until the update is released later this year.
Apple (AAPL, Tech30) pledged to increase the diversity in its emoji keyboard last March, after a public outcry over the limited options for people of color. A petition at DoSomething.org collected thousands of signatures. Miley Cyrus even tweeted about it, helping it to go viral on Twitter.
The current illustrated icons include same-sex couples but no black characters. There is an Asian man wearing a traditional Chinese cap and an Indian man in a turban, but the rest of the emoji population is light-skinned.
Taco Bell: Emoji unfairly biased towards hamburger and pizza lovers
Creating a more diverse emoji selection wasn't as easy as releasing a new iOS update. The keyboard of illustrated icons is based on Unicode, the standard for text, numbers and emojis across all platforms. Emoji originated in Japan and were added to the Unicode Standard in 2010. Apple first included them natively in iOS in 2011.
""Apple supports and cares deeply about diversity, and is working with The Unicode Consortium to update the standard so that it better represents diversity for all of us,"" said an Apple spokesperson.
To come up with the expanded palette of skin tones, Unicode used the Fitzpatrick scale, which was originally developed by dermatologists to classify different types of skin.
Apple is also adding 32 new country flags and an expanded selection of family icons that include more same-sex couples.

Now it's getting weird.
Samsung and LG are going toe-to-toe in a dispute that involves lawyers, criminal complaints and washing machines.
Wait -- washing machines? Yes, this skirmish is over four damaged washing machines with a total value of around $11,000.
Samsung alleges that Jo Seong-jin, the CEO of LG's home appliance division, vandalized four high-end Samsung washing machines last year during a visit to a store in Germany showcasing Samsung products.
Jo denies the charges, and insists that he was merely testing the hinges on the machine doors.
After simmering for months, the dispute flared to life last week when South Korean prosecutors indicted Jo on vandalism charges.
Related: Samsung's latest WTF phone
LG responded by publishing closed-circuit television footage of the incident it had gotten from German authorities.
The LG video runs nearly nine minutes, and includes several slow-motion shots of Jo examining Samsung products. Surrounded by men in suits in the middle of a bustling shop, he opens and closes various washing machine doors.
LG suggested that the footage exonerates Jo.
In response, Samsung accused LG of ""arbitrarily editing"" the footage. ""We seriously considered revealing the full footage to the media but after careful consideration, we decided not to,"" Samsung said in a statement.
Samsung also doesn't buy the idea that Jo was ""testing"" their products.
""No electronics companies in the world test their competitor's product that is being displayed in foreign market,"" Samsung said. ""The displayed products are for consumers. It is a standard procedure for them to purchase the product and test it in a lab.""
Dustups between Samsung and LG are nothing new.
Previously, refrigerators have been the main point of contention. In 2012, Samsung targeted LG with a video of its own -- this one was called ""The Inconvenient Truth About Refrigerator Capacity.""

From week to week, these workers aren't scheduled for the same hours on the same days. Only when the schedule is posted do they really find out when they are working and when they are off.
""It's hard to plan your life around,"" said Fatmata Jabbie, a 21-year-old single mom of two who works at a Walmart store in Virginia.
Jabbie often works five days a week, but it can be four or six.
""Sometimes I try to look for some other work on the side, but it's really hard when the schedule is always different,"" Jabbie said.
That will change at Walmart, at least partly, starting in 2016. A new policy will offer some workers, most likely those with the most experience, the same shifts on the same days, the company said Thursday.
Related: 24 hours with a minimum wage worker
The schedule change came along with the company's announcement that it will raise pay well above the minimum wage.
But a consistent schedule may be just as important for some hourly workers. It could mean the difference between holding down a second job or going to school.
It's especially important for workers who have fewer resources to handle disruptions that come up in life, said Claire McKenna, a policy analyst at the National Employment Law Project.
A sudden change in schedule, for example, could leave a parent with little in the way of child care options.

Nearly 60% of all American workers are paid hourly, and complaints about erratic scheduling aren't new.
Workers and labor groups have advocated for fairer scheduling for years.
Starbucks (SBUX) said it would revise its own scheduling policy last year. The change came after a New York Times article chronicled the daily life of single mom who was struggling to care for her son while working sporadic hours as a barista.
Starbucks said it would update its scheduling software to provide ""stability and consistency"" for its workers, as well as post schedules at least one week in advance. It also eliminated ""clopening"" shifts that required an employee to work the closing and opening shifts back-to-back.

The company was just granted a patent for a design that would make electronic ""components within a computing device"" water resistant. The application doesn't specify which Apple products the plans pertain to.
By protecting parts on the inside, a phone may have a better chance of surviving a dip in the pool.
Since the waterproofing is internal, that would set it apart from other waterproof smartphones already on the market, which often come with a more durable casing than non-waterproof models.
The Samsung Galaxy S5, for example, is water resistant because it has a more protective case that doesn't let water get inside. But Samsung is losing the plastic shell for its next model, the Galaxy S6. The new frame will be aluminum -- which means this new model won't be water resistant.
Apple (AAPL, Tech30) did not respond to a request for comment. But execs there seem to think that their new design would be more effective than a waterproof encasing.
""While bulky cases have had a certain amount of success at mitigating water entry ... a protective case is of little or no value once water has entered a device housing,"" it wrote in its patent application.

President Obama wants Congress to pass legislation that would allow employees to earn up to seven days of paid sick leave a year.
While federal law currently does not require sick leave, it's a common benefit for government workers and full-time employees at big corporations.
But nearly 43 million private-sector workers don't get paid sick leave, according to the White House.
So who are these workers?
They're usually part time: About 74% of full-time workers get paid sick leave, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics, while around 24% of part-time workers get the perk.

They work for small businesses: Smaller companies are more likely not to offer paid sick leave, largely because of cost. Around half of firms with 50 or fewer workers offer the benefit while 81% of those with 500-plus employees have it, according to Paul Harrington, director of the Center for Labor Markets and Policy at Drexel University.
Related: U.S. is 65th in world on gender pay gap
They're often in the service industry: Workers with service sector jobs, like food service or hospitality, are likely to go without sick time, along with those in health-care support services, including home health aids or dental assistants.
""Those are the exact type of jobs that you want people to stay at home because they have such high interactions with customers and co-workers,"" said Jessica Milli, a senior research associate at The Institute for Women's Policy Research.
Many are Hispanic: Hispanic employees are less likely to have paid sick leave than white, Asian or black workers, according to Milli, with less than half of Hispanic workers getting the benefit.
They're on the lower end of the income ladder: Government data show 90% of the top 10% of earners get paid sick time off, while 21% in the bottom 10% get it.
""Part of that is that you are more likely to be part time in the [lower bracket],"" said Harrington.
Related: Behind the 78 cent wage gap
The costs and benefits:
The Labor Department puts the cost of paid sick leave at 34 cents an hour per worker, or about 1% of total compensation. To make up for the added cost, experts predict that employers could cut back on other compensation costs, like taking away paid holidays, lowering wages, or pulling back on hiring or raises.
But putting the cost of a mandate on the government could help smaller firms handle the burden.
""Paying the costs through unemployment insurance or disability or some other form of federal or state government [funds] might make the case easier to push forward,"" said Aparna Mathur, an economist at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute.
Offering sick days often leads to increased productivity and reduced health-care costs for businesses. It also benefits children by allowing parents to stay home with a sick child.
""When we aren't operating at 100% ... that represents a cost to employers,"" said Milli. ""Allowing them to stay home means a faster recovery and fewer co-workers getting sick also brings savings.

2014-09-22 09:46:01,"7 safety tips from hackers - Sep. 22, 2014 ",http://money.cnn.com/2014/09/22/technology/security/hacker-safety-tips/index.html,"It's easy to get hacked. And yes, it can happen to you.
Follow this advice from actual hackers, and you'll be a lot safer online.
1. Turn off your phone's Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. Hackers are religious about this. Keeping these features ""on"" all the time makes it easy for strangers to slip into your phone.
The problem? If you keep Wi-Fi and Bluetooth active, hackers can see what networks you've connected to before, spoof them and trick your phone into connecting to Wi-Fi and Bluetooth devices that hackers carry around.
Once connected to your phone, hackers can bombard your device with malware, steal data or spy on you. And you won't even notice.
So, turn on Wi-Fi and Bluetooth when you need them. Turn them off when you don't.
2. Use two-step authentication. Nowadays, a single password isn't enough. They get exposed all the time.
Lots of email and social media services offer an extra later of protection: two-step authentication -- essentially a second, temporary password.
For example, when you set this up with Google, (GOOG) Twitter (TWTR, Tech30) and LinkedIn, (LNKD, Tech30) they ask you for a secret code every time you log in from a new device. You immediately get a text message with a six-digit number.
It's an effective way to keep out hackers. Even if someone gets your password, they'd still need your phone too -- an unlikely scenario.
3. Create a smart password strategy. For the select few websites with your most sensitive information (email, bank), create some long and unique passphrases, like +hisPl@tinumDr@gonBreathesF1re.
For everything else? Use a password manager. This type of program stores all your passwords online, so you can make each one different, and you won't have to remember them all.
But only use a password manager that encrypts them on your device. LastPass and Password Safe do this.
(Why not use a password manager for everything? One master password unlocks them all. You create a single point of failure.)
Change all of your passwords more than once a year.
Related: Hackers show ways to protect your iPhone

4. Use HTTPS on every website. Install the HTTPS Everywhere tool developed by the pro-privacy Electronic Frontier Foundation. It encrypts all the information your browser is sending between your computer and websites.
If you only see HTTP in the address bar, anyone can spy on your Internet session.
5. Bulk up your home Wi-Fi. Setting up Wi-Fi at home is a tour through the circles of hell. But these two steps are important.
First, set up a password. Don't keep the default password on the sticker.
Next, the machine will ask what type of security encryption standard you'd like. Choose WPA-2.
Lots of machines default to WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) or WPA (Wireless Protected Access). Avoid them at all costs. A known Wi-Fi flaw can give up your password in seconds.
6. Don't hide your home Wi-Fi. Your home router asks: ""Hide the SSID?"" If you say yes, then your devices are forced to ""actively scan"" for the home network you're trying to hide. Sure, they'll connect. But as a result, your device ""actively scans"" for networks all the time.
Your laptop and phone are more susceptible to connecting to strangers' unsafe Wi-Fi networks.
""You're actually setting yourself back five years in terms of security,"" said Ben Smith, an experienced Wi-Fi hacker who's worked on secretive government projects.
7. Think twice before buying an Internet-connected device. Do you really need a ""smart"" fridge or oven?
Companies are still figuring out the kinks -- especially the tiny ones raising money on crowdfunding websites like Kickstarter and Indiegogo, according to Duo Security researcher Mark Stanislav.
Tech companies are in a rush to slap the Internet on everything. Cool features get all the attention. Privacy and safety don't.
As a case in point, a foul-mouthed hacker hijacked a baby's monitor last year.
""You might be getting told things are secure, when they're not,"" said Stanislav, who hacks devices for research.

2015-03-10 07:41:10,"Meet Apple's new, super-thin 12-inch MacBook - Mar. 10, 2015 ",http://money.cnn.com/2015/03/10/technology/apple-12-inch-macbook/index.html,"Forget all your wires and cables. You won't need them if you buy Apple's new MacBook -- it only has two ports.
Apple's new MacBook is its thinnest and lightest laptop to date. To achieve this feat, Apple (AAPL, Tech30) engineers streamlined many features traditionally associated with portable computers, and eliminated some as well. Here's what you need to know:
1. The body is tapered like the MacBook Air. At its thickest, the new 12-inch MacBook is 13.1mm high (about half an inch) -- 24% thinner than the existing 11-inch MacBook Air.
""Can you even see it? I can't even see it,"" Philip Schiller, Apple's senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing, said on stage at an Apple event Monday afternoon, holding a closed laptop.
2. It weighs two pounds. For comparison, the MacBook Air weighs almost two-and-a-half pounds. The iPad Air 2 weighs just under one pound.
3. Taking a page from the iPhone design book, the new, all-metal body MacBook comes in three different colors: silver, gray, and gold.
4. The new MacBook is fanless, which is partly why the laptop is so thin and light.
5. There are only two ports. One is a headphone port, and the other port is for a new kind of USB connector called the USB-C. The USB-C port is about a third of the size of a standard USB port, and serves as a single connection point to charge the laptop's batteries, transfer data, and transmit video.
For consumers who want to use their existing, standard USB devices with the laptop, this new USB format will most likely be a pain point. An adapter dongle for the USB-C port costs $80 on the Apple store.
6. Apple has also redesigned the keyboard, which now extends to the edges of the laptop. The keyboard has also been updated to respond to lighter touches, meaning less pounding when typing. The surface of each key is also 17% larger and is lit by individual LED lights underneath ""for more precise illumination,"" Schiller said.
7. The computer's track pad also got a nice upgrade. Like the new Apple Watch, the track pad is now powered by Apple's new Taptic Engine, which picks up on how forceful a touch or tap is. For example, instead of clicking repeatedly on the fast forward button on Quicktime to speed up a video, you only need to press down on the new track pad a little longer and harder than a tap to achieve the same goal.
8. On stage at the event, Schiller said the new MacBook is the ""world's most energy-efficient notebook."" The laptop's Intel Core M processor consumes five watts of power, and its newly designed and contoured battery cells have 35% more capacity.
9. The new MacBook has a battery life of up to 10 hours.
10. The cost for a new 12-inch MacBook 1.1 GHz dual-core Intel Core M processor with 256GB of flash storage starts $1,299. A 12-inch 1.2 GHz dual-core Intel Core M processor MacBook with 512GB of flash storage starts at $1,599.
11. Shipping starts April 10.

Yet he doesn't have a copy of his own broadcast.
""All I have is what's in my memory,"" said Whitaker, now 90.
Neither CBS, where Whitaker worked during the 1967 game, or the other network that televised it that year, NBC, have recordings of the match up between the Packers and the Chiefs.
There are snippets of tape available, mostly from the sidelines, but most of the game has been lost to history.
Until a man found a copy in an attic in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, and came forward with it in 2005.
Now the man's incredible discovery is in a sort of legal limbo, and the tape is yet to be seen by the public.
Slide show: The latest Super Bowl ads
The Paley Center for Media, a cultural organization, restored the recording -- originally on two-inch quadruplex tapes -- but ""we keep it locked up in a vault,"" said Ron Simon, Paley's curator.
Simon has seen the whole game -- complete with an interview of Packers coach Vince Lombardi at the end. He called it ""a remarkable document.""
""It's really a history of what the game is,"" he said.
But he needs the permission of the man who found the recording, and ""maybe the NFL's permission too,"" to screen it for anyone else.
Steven Harwood is an attorney for the man, who wishes to remain anonymous. I interviewed Harwood on CNN's ""Reliable Sources"" on Sunday.
Harwood said he'd like to strike a deal with the NFL, which has a copyright on the game. But he suggested that the two sides don't see eye to eye about the tape's worth.
""We feel being compensated for preserving it for all these years is certainly a reasonable thing to do,"" he said.
Harwood cited what Sports Illustrated wrote in 2005 when it listed the tape as one of the sports world's 25 ""lost treasures"" -- an estimated value of ""more than $1 million.""
""To put that in perspective, $1 million is the equivalent of about seven seconds of commercial airtime on today's game,"" he said.
Harwood also mentioned that ""Super Bowl 50 is coming up next year,"" so it's ""an exciting time to revisit what happened in January 1967.""
Simon, the Paley Center curator, isn't sure when or how the tape will see the light of day, but he is confident that ""one day it's going to happen.""
Simon and Harwood have stayed in touch over the years. And I'm going to put Whitaker and Simon in touch, too, in case they can work something out.
""We didn't have [many] people who were interested in the history of our industry in those days,"" Whitaker told me. ""We lost a lot of important tapes and recordings of important events. I think that's been corrected now, thank goodness.""
Whitaker was an announcer on 12 Super Bowl broadcasts, but he said ""none of them kind of measure up"" to that first one.
For Simon, having a restored copy of Super Bowl I is valuable, even though he can't show it to anyone.
Just knowing that it was laying dormant in an attic for so long, he said, ""gives us hope that there are other things out there like it.""

2015-01-31 03:58:11,"What Super Bowl? The Ad Bowl has already begun - Jan. 31, 2015 ",http://money.cnn.com/2015/01/31/media/super-bowl-advertisers/index.html,"The Super Bowl is Sunday evening, but the Ad Bowl is already underway.
Some Super Bowl advertisers have been previewing their ads for days, trying to maximize their multimillion dollar investments. Others are keeping their ads under wraps until game time, believing that's the best way to stand out.
At an average cost of $4.5 million per 30-second ad, the stakes are obviously high.
NBC said ad time during the four quarters of the game officially sold out earlier this week. Almost as valuable is the commercial time during the network's six-hour pre-show -- and after the game, when NBC will show its popular drama ""The Blacklist.""
Watch: Super Bowl's strangest prop bets
More than ever, Super Bowl advertisers are supplementing their 15-, 30- and 60-second spots with viral online videos and what marketers call ""social media war rooms.""
But the spots are undoubtedly the most important part. On top of what's paid to NBC, companies pay advertising firms huge amounts of money to distill brand messages into funny, timely, celeb-filled, sex-soaked ads.
The game will feature 15 first-time Super Bowl advertisers.
""If you would have told me 10 years ago that Chevy wouldn't be in the Super Bowl, but that Wix.com or Dove products for men would be, I'd be very surprised,"" Richard Kirshenbaum, the CEO of ad agency NSG/SWAT, said on CNN's ""New Day.""
""But there's a new lineup. There's a new America,"" he added.
Wix, a website-building company, is one of the first-timers. Chief marketing officer Omer Shai told CNNMoney that it prepared almost a dozen ""teaser"" ads ahead of Sunday.
""We are updating and changing the campaign on a daily basis according to performance,"" Shai said. ""This is the year that we're comfortable [taking] the brand to the next level.""
Other newbies include the online insurance company Esurance, the glue brand Loctite, the toenail fungus treatment Jublia, and the mobile game maker UCool.

Household names like McDonald's (MCD), Coca-Cola (KO), Budweiser, and BMW will be present, too.
Coca Cola has a 60-second ad rebuking Internet ""haters"" that won't be seen until the game. But the company has already released clips with stars like Danica Patrick, Michael Sam and Robby Novak, better known as Kid President.
A Coke representative said the ad is ""intended to disrupt the complacency that's set in around online negativity"" -- something that anyone who's spent time on Facebook or Twitter knows about.
Perhaps the most thought-provoking ad of the game will be the one commissioned by the NFL for its ""No More"" initiative, intended to stop domestic violence and sexual assault.
""The spot, which features a woman calling 911 and pretending to order a pizza because her husband is in the room, is based on a real 911 call,"" said the ad blog Spot Bowl, which called it a ""game-changer.""
It said the NFL was giving over ""some of the airtime it normally reserves for light-hearted self promos"" for the PSA.

Marketers come to the Super Bowl with a wide variety of missions.
For Victoria's Secret, its ad is part of a weeks-long campaign leading up to Valentine's Day.
For TurboTax, the timing is right, too, because it's tax season.
Weight Watchers is using the stage to introduce a rebooted brand.
NBC will be promoting several of its forthcoming shows, like ""Odyssey"" and a variety show hosted by Neil Patrick Harris.
Most of the ads will, in one form or another, strive to make 110 million viewers laugh -- and, most importantly, remember the advertisers."

The average ticket price so far is $3,554 -- about $1,000 more than last year, according to SeatGeek, which tracks online sales.
SeatGeek analyst Connor Gregoire said he does not expect the price for the few remaining tickets to come down before the Seahawks and Patriots face off on Sunday in front of 72,000 fans in Phoenix.
On Friday, the cheapest ticket was going for nearly $8,000 and the most expensive topped $24,000, according to SeatGeek.
And there are very few left -- only about 300 tickets on Friday. On the same day last year, there were about 4,000.

Getting a ticket to the Super Bowl is a tricky business. Only 1,000 are sold to fans at face value. The rest are divvied up among the league, which gives a lot to corporate sponsors, and the teams. Those tickets are either auctioned off to season tickets holders, or sold by brokers on the secondary market.
In the past few years, many buyers have held out until the last minute and, in fact, got a good deal as prices fell in the days leading to the game.
Game day is actually the busiest in the resale market, Gregoire said.
But this year prices have gone up. It's not entirely clear why. But there are fewer tickets than expected on the secondary market. That will leave some fans out of luck.

The Seattle Seahawks owner Paul Allen is by far the richest in the league. The Microsoft (MSFT, Tech30) co-founder is worth about $17 billion, according to various estimates.
The Seahawks head to the Super Bowl for the second year in a row. This year they face off against the New England Patriots which are owned by Robert Kraft, who has a net worth of $4 billion, making him the sixth richest owner in the NFL.
The two men made their money in very different ways.

Allen helped Bill Gates start Microsoft when both were students at Harvard, and left the company with a chunk of its then privately-held stock in 1983 which translated in to the bulk of his wealth. Allen also made about $2 billion from the appreciation in value of the Seahawks and the NBA's Portland Trail Blazers, both of which he bought decades ago.

By contrast, Patriots owner Robert Kraft made most of his $4 billion fortune in football. He bought his team for a reported $172 million in 1994, and today it's worth an estimated $2.6 billion.

The somber spot, produced by the domestic violence advocacy group NoMore.org, is a stark contrast to the Super Bowl's traditionally humorous ads.
It shows a home that's obviously been the scene of a struggle, with broken pictures and a hole punched in the wall.
The soundtrack is a woman calling 911 but pretending to order a pizza in order not to anger her attacker. At first the male 911 operator tries to get her off the phone. Then he realizes she needs help but can't speak because her attacker is in the room. He tells her police are about a minute away and asks her to stay on the line but she hangs up.

""When it's hard to talk, it's up to us to listen,"" say words that appear at the bottom of the screen.
The Super Bowl is by far the most high-profile adverting platform in media. Advertisers will spend $4.5 million for a 30-second spot this year, and often millions more producing the ads with high quality special effects and celebrity endorsers.
The NFL has a deal to run spots during every game that's broadcast, and it sometimes uses them to address public relations issues like serious player injuries.
NoMore.org ran dozens of public service commercials during the football season paid for by the NFL, featuring stars like Eli Manning knocking down excuses for domestic violence, saying ""No more boys will be boys,"" and ""No more it's just the way he is.""
The total value of the airtime donated, including the Super Bowl spot, is about $50 million, said NFL spokeswoman Clare Graff.

NoMore.org is an umbrella group of several different organizations that combat domestic violence and sexual assault.
NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell was widely criticized earlier this year for how he handled domestic violence charges against some NFL players. Goodell suspended star running back Ray Rice for just two games after the player admitted to knocking out his then-fiancee. When a tape of him hitting her later surfaced, Goodell admited he had made a mistake and made the suspension indefinite.
The league was also criticized by top sponsors, including Anheuser Busch (BUD), which said the NFL was not doing enough to address domestic violence.
But most sponsors and team owners remained supportive of Goodell.
The NFL has also donated millions of dollars to domestic violence support groups in the wake of the controversy."

While Patriots fans are much more likely hang out at concerts and imbibe at bars, Seahawks fans prefer to frequent water parks and the zoo. And unsurprisingly, they prefer to buy in bulk at Costco (COST) (founded in Seattle), unlike their competitors who shop at Sam's Club.
This is all according to a study released by startup PlaceIQ. The ad tech firm partnered with Datalogix to take a look at this year's Super Bowl fans: Patriots fans are more likely to be single, have a higher income ($75,000 or more) and be a bit older (35 to 54). Seahawks fans skew younger (25 to 44), tend to be married with kids, and earn a little less ($50,000 or more).
PlaceIQ also looked at how their likes, dislikes and habits compared to the average American consumer.

Last year's big game broke records with 112.2 million average viewers, enough to make it the most-watched broadcast in American TV history.
And since Nielsen doesn't account for Super Bowl viewing parties and sports bars, the true number is actually even larger.
So what about this year's match-up? NBC will be televising the game on traditional TV (and online, although that's not measured the same way) -- will it break another viewership record?
We asked six media and sports experts to weigh in on what they think this year's Nielsen ratings will be.
Here are edited excerpts of what they said:
Richard Deitsch, reporter for Sports Illustrated
Prediction: 115.5 million
""One of the few givens of a Super Bowl broadcast is that the game will set a new broadcast record. This year's game features the two best teams in football... and the turbo fuel of a pregame controversy (Deflate-gate) that has crossed over into popular culture.
The bottom line: If the game is close heading into the fourth quarter, the viewership number is going to be a monster.""
James Andrew Miller, co-author of ""Those Guys Have All the Fun: Inside the World of ESPN""

""This Super Bowl has it all -- two truly great teams; two marquee QB's; and a bunch of characters on either team to love or despise. On top of all that, throw in a scandal that delivers new tidbits each day, and you've got a new record.""
John Berman, co-anchor of CNN's AT This Hour & CNN's resident Patriots fan

""Upward trend of ratings for live events (especially sports) will be tempered by Patriots malaise. For some people, Tom Brady is just too pretty.""
Brad Adgate, senior vice president of research at Horizon Media
Prediction: 111.8 million
""I think the audience will be slightly lower this year. NFL ratings were not as strong this year as last year and the conference championship games were both down significantly from a year ago which is always a good bellwether.""
James Poniewozik, TV and media columnist for Time Magazine
Prediction: 112.5 million
""Another new record by a slight margin. There's no science here. Simply: the seven most-watched Super Bowls are also the seven most recent, and the audiences have trended slightly up.
Why? In the DVR & streaming era, big live events like this are the only TV programs still able to grow audience, even if marginally. So I'll guess this one does too.""

Ringling Bros. announced Thursday it will gradually reduce the use of elephants in its shows, and all will be retired by 2018.
It's the end of an era for the animal that Ringling calls ""a lifelong symbol"" of its circus.
Elephants have for years played prominently in the circus' shows and its advertising. They triumphantly enter the ring, then perform a synchronized dance routine.
But Ringling Bros.' treatment of the pachyderms has also come under scrutiny. It has been repeatedly criticized, picketed and even sued by several animal rights groups, including the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and the Humane Society of the United States.
In 2011, the circus was fined $270,000 by the USDA for violations of the Animal Welfare Act.
The People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals applauded the announcement, but said the elephants should be retired immediately.
""(I)f Ringling is telling the truth about ending this horror, then it's a day to pop the champagne corks and rejoice,"" PETA founder Ingrid E. Newkirk said.
Ringling Bros. said it currently has 13 elephants traveling for its shows.
About 40 are at its 200-acre Center for Elephant Conservation in Florida, created in 1995 by Ringling as a facility for the care and study of Asian elephants, the variety it uses in shows and an endangered species.
That amounts to ""the largest sustainable population of captive Asian elephants in the Western Hemisphere,"" the conservation center said.
""No other institution has done or is doing more to save this species from extinction, and that is something of which I and my family are extremely proud,"" said Kenneth Feld, the chairman and CEO of Ringling Bros.
""This decision was not easy, but it is in the best interest of our company, our elephants and our customers,"" Feld said.
Ringling Bros. said its shows ""will continue to feature other extraordinary animal performers, including tigers, lions, horses, dogs and camels.""
Its full cast is between 250 and 300 people. Between three performing units, the circus visits about 115 cities each year.

With a little tinkering, researchers are taking that same pen and using it to measure glucose levels.
Nano-engineers at the University of California, San Diego have invented a technique that turns cheap pens into dispensers for do-it-yourself sensors. They replace the regular gel with a custom biochemical ink that can measure specific chemicals.
When drawn on the body, the ink adheres much like a temporary tattoo. It can detect things like the amounts of sodium insulate, lactate and glucose in your sweat. To read the measurements, the group is creating an electric Bluetooth-enabled device that will take the info from the drawn-on sensor and transfer it to a smartphone or laptop.
For diabetics who need to check their blood glucose levels daily, this could be a cheaper alternative to prefabricated glucose strips. (Earlier this year, another group of researchers tested a temporary paper tattoo that measured glucose levels using a small electrical shock.)
Related: How these 5 startups are reimagining the world
Currently, the drawings can only provide a single measurement, but the researchers would like to eventually make a single tattoo work for all-day monitoring. The pen encourages creative doodling, which could be appealing for children.
""The whole point was having a system that can be used easily by any untrained end users to develop sensors by themselves,"" said Amay Bandodkar, a fourth year graduate student at UC San Diego who created the pen. The work was led by professor Joseph Wang in the Department of NanoEngineering.
The applications aren't limited to the human body. To measure toxins in the air, such as phenol, the group drew on the leaves of plants. The ink isn't toxic and doesn't hurt the foliage.
Though they are still in the early stages of developing the technology, the researchers are looking into expanding the number of chemicals the pen can detect.
Bandokar thinks the technology, called enzymatic sensors, could serve a wide range of real world uses. For example, a soldier could draw a line on a wall to detect explosives or gunshot residue. In some situations, the drawing could blend into its surroundings without arousing suspicion."

Four states -- Washington, Colorado, Alaska and Oregon -- have legalized the sale of recreational marijuana, and 23 states have legalized its medical use. (In Washington D.C., you can smoke it, but you can't sell it.)

HBO said it's currently working on deals with Internet providers. If it strikes deals with companies like Comcast (CMCSA) and Time Warner Cable (TWC), you might be able to order HBO Now as part of your broadband Internet package -- and stream it on any approved device.
Apple device owners can buy HBO Now no matter what happens. Want to stream it on your PC? You must own at least one Apple device.
As for other home streaming devices, like Roku, Xbox and PlayStation? HBO struck an exclusive, three-month device deal with Apple, so those devices won't be getting HBO Now until early July. And even then, that's only if they cut deals with HBO.
HBO is owned by Time Warner (TWX), which is the parent company of CNNMoney.

Titanium dioxide is used to make the powdered sugar appear brighter. It is also used in sunscreen and paints.
The group As You Sow argues titanium dioxide that can cause DNA and chromosomal damage when consumed. The decision by Dunkin' Donuts (DNKN) was recently disclosed by the advocacy group.
""This is a groundbreaking decision,"" said Danielle Fugere, president and chief counsel of the group. ""Dunkin' has demonstrated strong industry leadership by removing this potentially harmful ingredient from its donuts.""
The group claims that titanium dioxide is a nanomaterial, which is not regulated or prohibited by the Food and Drug Administration. But As You Sow argues that there is not enough information on their effects on humans.
""Asbestos, also a nanomaterial, was used before its harms were fully understood, leading to a costly health crisis,"" the group said.
Dunkin' Donuts claims that titanium dioxide ""does not meet the definition of 'nanomaterial' as outlined under FDA guidance."" But it said nonetheless it is making the change to remove the chemical from its donuts.

As We Sow has been introducing shareholder proposals at companies calling for the removal of titanium dioxide from various products. Such a resolution was supported by about 19% of Dunkin' Brands' shareholders last year.
The group released a letter sent by a Dunkin executive saying it has reformulated the powered sugar and was working on a schedule to roll out the new recipe.
It led As We Sow to drop a similar shareholder resolution from the company's upcoming proxy."
2015-02-12 08:11:57,"You'll pay a lot more to see the doctor with Obamacare than with job-based health insurance - Feb. 12, 2015 ",http://money.cnn.com/2015/02/12/news/economy/obamacare-costs/index.html,"Obamacare enrollees have to shell out a lot more to see the doctor or get medications than their peers with job-based health insurance.
Deductibles, co-payments, and drug payments are higher under the average Obamacare silver-level plans -- the most popular -- than employer policies, according to a CNNMoney comparison of reports by Kaiser Family Foundation and Health Research & Education Trust. The reports looked at policies offered on the exchanges for 2015 and those enrolled in employer plans in 2014.
To be sure, having Obamacare coverage is often better than being uninsured, especially if you rack up big bills through a major illness or accident.
Obamacare also offers cost-sharing subsidies for low-income Americans, which reduces their deductibles and co-pays. Health reform also mandated that insurers fully cover a range of preventative services, such as an annual wellness exam and various screenings, for free.
And there is wide variety in out-of-pocket costs in both Obamacare and job-based plans. For many in the individual market, Obamacare eliminated sky-high deductibles of $10,000 or more that were common before health reform.
""The cost sharing is higher on the exchange than in the employer market, but it's lower than it was before,"" said Gary Claxton, director of the Health Care Marketplace Project, at the Kaiser Family Foundation.
Those who need regular medical care can often opt for policies with smaller out-of-pocket costs, but they usually come with higher monthly premiums. For instance, gold-level Obamacare plans have lower deductibles and co-pays but cost more per month. Employers offer plans with more generous benefits, but they too come at a price.
Related: Cost keeps uninsured from enrolling in Obamacare
High deductibles have been a sore point with some Obamacare enrollees. They have complained that they have to shell out thousands of dollars, on top of their monthly premium, before their insurance kicks in. Employers have also been raising deductibles, but they are generally lower than in many Obamacare plans.
Even after they meet the deductible, enrollees in both Obamacare and work-based plans have to fork over a co-pay or co-insurance, a share of the bill, to see a doctor. Employers have been raising their co-pays in recent years, but those in Obamacare plans are still higher.
When it comes to co-insurance, Obamacare policyholders have to shoulder a larger burden. Obamacare enrollees will have to pay 26% of the charge to see a primary care doctor or a specialist, while those in job-based insurance pay only 18% for primary care and 19% for specialist visits.
Most health insurance plans now offer tiered levels of drug coverage, depending on the prescription needed. You'll pay about the same amount for generic drugs, but preferred brand-name drugs are pricier under Obamacare.
Before Obamacare, plans on the individual market usually had no annual ceiling on out-of-pocket costs. Employer plans often did set a limit on workers' liability each year.
Now, both groups have that protection, though Obamacare enrollees are responsible for nearly twice what employees are, on average.
Whatever plan they have, consumers should brace for higher out-of-pocket costs in the future. Employers and insurers are pushing more of the burden onto patients, partly in an effort to keep premiums in check and partly to make consumers more conscious of their health care spending.

The elephants were the opening act for every show, three times a day, wherever we were, be it Cleveland, Rochester, or Washington D.C. Theirs was an iconic entry -- a row of 16 elephants, the trunk of one gripping the tail of the next in an unbroken pachydermal chain.
It brings back memories of that year, when I traveled with the circus.
I was a bored teenager looking for some excitement. And what's more exciting than the circus?
It just so happened that Ringling Brothers was in Asheville, North Carolina, where I lived at the time.
I had hiked the Appalachian Trail the previous year from Georgia to Maine and was trying to chart out my next adventure. I certainly wanted to keep traveling, but I also needed a job and a place to live.
The circus offered all that. I snagged the job on the spot.
""Get a haircut and shave and meet us in Raleigh in two days,"" the manager said.
Pretty easy, right? Well, the bar was pretty low for this particular job, which wasn't very glamorous.
I wish I could tell you that I was a trapeze artist and that I juggled swords and jumped into rings of fire, but I would be lying. Because I was just a lowly cotton candy vendor.
Related: No more elephants at the Greatest Show on Earth

I wore a stupid-looking hat with a clown on it and a red and blue tunic with a large pocket to hold crumpled dollar bills. I carried a large plastic tray studded with 50 holes to hold the paper cones with pink and blue pillows of cotton candy. I ran up and down the steps of the circus coliseum selling the candy for $2 a pop, for which I was paid a 13.5% commission. I'll do the math for you: I made 27 cents for each cotton candy.
I usually made about $150 a week, all in cash, which I kept in my Harley Davidson wallet.
Fortunately, as a member of the circus I got my own room on the train for only $7 a week.
As a vendor, I was not on the lowest rung in the circus hierarchy. That distinction went to the so-called ""working men,"" the laborers who shoveled elephant dung. They made $120 a week, and they slept on bunks. And they unfortunately always smelled like dung.
We worked each city for about a week, and then we would pack up and get on the train bound for the next town. We were all on the train together: vendors, equipment, performers, and even the animals.
In my short time at the circus I had enough crazy experiences to fill a book.
One time, I was running through the stands selling cotton candy when an alligator escaped during a live act. It was the job of a strongman named Tahar-- the Master of Jungle Beasts-- to wrestle gators. The alligators were usually sluggish, but that time, one gator made a break for the audience.
Hundreds of people stood up and screamed as that gator charged at them, leading with its teeth.
I survived the experience (along with everybody else) and spent the rest of the summer with another show called the Big Apple Circus. I heard they needed a vendor so I met up with them in Brooklyn and traveled throughout the northeast.
I got a job there to help set up and tear down the big top and truck it from town to town.
Then the season ended. They said there was a job waiting for me when the season ramped up again.
But I moved on to Vermont instead and became a snowmaker at a ski resort for $6 an hour. And then I went to college.
The Big Apple Circus also had a real popular elephant act, which is why it's so hard to imagine any circus without them.

William H. Scheide, an alumnus from the class of 1936 who died last year at the age of 100, left about 2,500 books and manuscripts to his alma mater, the university announced Tuesday.
The collection includes the first six printed editions of the Bible, including the famed Gutenberg Bible of 1455, and the first printed editions of Shakespeare's plays.
It also includes an autographed 1856 speech by Abraham Lincoln about slavery, original letters from Gen. Ulysses Grant from the end of the Civil War, early journals by explorers of the New World, early printed reports of battles in the Revolutionary War and a 1754 journal by the future president, Maj. George Washington.
The collection also reflects Scheide's interest in music and musicology, with an autographed music sketchbook from Beethoven and manuscripts from Bach, Mozart, Schubert and Wagner.

Scheide's collection was amassed over 150 years. His grandfather William Taylor Scheide started the collection in 1865, and built upon it from his earnings as an oil executive. The collection was continued by his father John Hinsdale Scheide, also an oil executive, from Princeton's class of 1896.
The collection was kept in their hometown of Titusville, Pennsylvania, the birthplace of the oil industry, until 1959, when it was moved to Princeton. It has been kept at Princeton since that time in the Scheide Library section of the university's Firestone Library. In this way it was made available to Princeton students, despite its status as a private collection.
""He loved showing people -- especially young people who had never seen anything like this before -- the collection, letting them touch the books and experience what he called 'the wow factor,'"" said Scheide's widow, Judy McCartin Scheide, who helped him amass the collection.

To prepare, primp and promote a dog that can compete with the beautiful canines that strutted their stuff this week at the 2015 Westminster Dog Show can easily run you $50,000 to $100,000 a year.
That's according to Michael Canalizo, a former professional dog handler and show-dog owner who now runs event management for the American Kennel Club.
Here's a ballpark breakdown of where your money will go if you want to end up with a Westminster champ like Miss P, the 15-inch Beagle who is this year's winner of Best in Show:
Buying the right dog: Whatever your favorite breed, you want to get a dog with the right pedigree, temperament and breed look. For a show-quality dog with some training, you might spend between $5,000 and $8,000 up front, Canalizo said.
Entering shows: Entry fees are usually $25 to $30 per show. Figure that you might enter your dog in 10 to 15 shows a month. Annual cost: Up to $5,400.
Paying the handler: Handler fees per show can run from $75 to $700 depending on how many wins your dog scores in a given event. That assumes your handler is showing other dogs too. If you want the handler to work for you exclusively, expect to pay much more. Also, handling fees tend to double for the biggest shows like Westminster. Annual cost: $24,000 and up if your dog wins often.
Advertising your dog: A winning dog needs press. Canalizo estimates you could spend $1,000 a month on ads to promote your dog in the trade magazines that show judges receive. Social media, too, has become a big outlet for promoting your prized pooch, and it typically doesn't cost a thing. Annual cost: $12,000.
Grooming the dog: If you're partial to breeds that require specialized styling for shows (hello, cotton-ball-puff poodle paws!) that might cost you up to $50 a week. Annual cost: $2,600.
Covering travel, hotels and food: Most dog shows are not in your backyard. So you'll have to pony up for the travel and hotel costs of your dog's handler, your dog and yourself if you plan to tag along. Lots of variables like distance and form of travel will affect cost. But it's probably not unreasonable to assume you might spend at least $1,000 a month. Annual cost: $12,000 at minimum.
Boarding: Sometimes a show dog will board throughout the year with a handler and that might cost $300 a month. Annual cost: $3,600.
Insuring: Canalizo estimates he paid insurance premiums both to insure the life of his show dog and to help pay for medical expenses. Annual cost: $1,000."

UK-based British Chocolate Club launched last week, selling treats that U.S. customers have been deprived of for the last few months.
An important thing to note: The recipes for British-made Cadbury and U.S.-made Cadbury are different (noticeably so, according to many fans). Hershey makes and distributes Cadbury in the U.S., so those wanting the authentic goods have bought from specialty shops (which in turn bought from Let's Buy British Imports). But Hershey sued LBB for trademark violations, so in January, LBB stopped importing British chocolates.
Robert Jeffreys and Rebecca Gerken are looking to capitalize on this hole.
Customers can join their subscription-based club for a monthly fee of $14.95 (for a box of eight chocolates) or $25.95 (fifteen bars) -- and shipping is free. Customers can choose from their favorite British chocolate bars -- including Flakes, Dairy Milk, Toffee Crisps, Yorkie Bars and Maltesers -- and can cancel at any time.
Jeffreys, who was a professional online poker player for five years, is a first-time entrepreneur.
""It is not a new business idea, but it is a bit of a new take,"" said Jeffreys, 30.
Jeffreys said he buys the chocolates wholesale and makes a $3 to $6 dollar profit on each box.
The startup, which is just over a week old, bought about 500 bars and has shipped roughly 20 boxes to customers.
""We are confident our business will take off,"" said Gerken, 26.
If the outrage generated by Hershey's suit is any indication, there's a large customer base at the ready. Over 36,000 people have signed a MoveOn.org petition to support LBB imports.
Though they didn't consult anyone before launching, the couple is not concerned about legal repercussions.
""It is the user who is importing the product, not us. And they can't go after the user as it is for personal use,"" said Jeffreys. ""Theoretically, Hershey could get Cadbury to stop selling to us. ... In reality though, that would be impossible to enforce.""
But Hershey spokesman Jeff Beckman doesn't quite see it that way.
""We own the rights to the brand in the United States,"" wrote Beckman in an email. ""It is still in violation to sell to consumers in the United States.""

The stat we're all so familiar with ""is an aggregate of all men and women in the workplace,"" said Christina Hoff Sommers, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. It doesn't take into account important variables like education level, total hours worked, type of work and job tenure, she said.
So, while Census Bureau data says the average woman working full time made nearly 22% less than her male counterpart in 2013, or 78.3 cents on every dollar, that doesn't mean that all women get paid less to do the exact same job as men.
Related: Microsoft CEO to women: Not asking for a raise is 'good karma'
But there is research that does indicate a discrepancy.
A study from the American Association of University Women that controlled for college major, occupation, age, geographical region, hours worked and more, showed there is still a 7% wage gap between male and female college grads a year after graduation.
""We reviewed men and women who have made exactly the same education and career choices and still found a gap,"" said Lisa Maatz, vice president of government relations at the AAUW.
The trend is particularly troublesome given that mothers are the primary breadwinners in 40% of U.S. households with children, according to a 2013 Pew Research Center report.
Some blame the pay gap on womens' career choices and family demands. Others fault workplace discrimination, or women's reluctance to negotiate for pay and promotions.
To make pay more equal, Maatz said society needs to add more value to ""pink-collar jobs"" that tend to be low-paying.
Related: Nadella outblunders Steve Ballmer
""We want women to go into lucrative professions, but we still need child-care workers, teachers and secretaries,"" she says. ""These jobs are needed, but aren't valued as much monetarily and that needs to change.""
The 78 cent wage gap is an improvement, according to the Census Bureau, up from 76.5 cents in 2012.
But the increase could have more to do with the decline of men in the labor force than gain for women.
""Men ages 25-34 have seen their wages fall 20% since 1980,"" said Kim Parker, director of social trends research at the Pew Research Center. ""So while there's been some wage improvement for women, the fall for men has been more significant [on closing the gap].""
Related: Microsoft CEO skewered on Twitter
Another Pew researcher, Rakesh Kochhar, points out that the wage gap gets smaller every time a new generation enters the workforce, but then climbs back up to about 75% by mid-career.
""We have no smoking gun on why that happens,"" Kochhar said, ""except that it coincides with the age when most women take time off for motherhood and other family matters."""

In Apple's next update of emoji icons, a number of the tiny cartoon people are now available in six different skin tones.
The male and female faces, as well as thumbs up/thumbs down icons, will be available in the different colors. Other people emoji, such as princesses and construction workers, will also get more diverse options. Tapping and holding on an emoji person will bring up the new skin-tone variations.
Black emojis are coming
The diverse people are just some of the 300 new emojis included in the latest developer version of iOS 8.3. The new icons won't be available to the public until the update is released later this year.
Apple (AAPL, Tech30) pledged to increase the diversity in its emoji keyboard last March, after a public outcry over the limited options for people of color. A petition at DoSomething.org collected thousands of signatures. Miley Cyrus even tweeted about it, helping it to go viral on Twitter.
The current illustrated icons include same-sex couples but no black characters. There is an Asian man wearing a traditional Chinese cap and an Indian man in a turban, but the rest of the emoji population is light-skinned.
Taco Bell: Emoji unfairly biased towards hamburger and pizza lovers
Creating a more diverse emoji selection wasn't as easy as releasing a new iOS update. The keyboard of illustrated icons is based on Unicode, the standard for text, numbers and emojis across all platforms. Emoji originated in Japan and were added to the Unicode Standard in 2010. Apple first included them natively in iOS in 2011.
""Apple supports and cares deeply about diversity, and is working with The Unicode Consortium to update the standard so that it better represents diversity for all of us,"" said an Apple spokesperson.
To come up with the expanded palette of skin tones, Unicode used the Fitzpatrick scale, which was originally developed by dermatologists to classify different types of skin.
Apple is also adding 32 new country flags and an expanded selection of family icons that include more same-sex couples.

The oft-requested feature allows you to choose a Facebook (FB, Tech30) friend to be a ""legacy contact,"" who will serve as a kind of executor of your social network page. The friend can post information on your behalf (such as funeral details), respond to new friend requests and update your profile photo.
Facebook said the legacy contact can't actually log into your account, change or delete any past posts, read your Facebook messages or remove your friends. But you can let your legacy contact download a copy of everything you've shared on Facebook, if you choose.
In the past, Facebook simply ""memorialized"" pages of people who died. The word ""remembering"" appeared next to the person's name on their profile, and friends were able to share memories of that person on his or her Timeline.
But Facebook wouldn't allow loved ones to change anything on the page, leaving many bereaved family members upset. They could -- and still can -- request that a page be taken down, but that can be a difficult process for some distraught loved ones.
To turn over access to a legacy contact, Facebook still requires people to request that a profile be memorialized, asking them to prove that a person has died.
To set up the legacy contact, click the down-arrow on the upper right hand corner of your screen. Click settings. Then on the left column, click Security, and then click Legacy Contact.
From there, you can enter the name of a Facebook friend to take control of your page after you die. It will auto-generate a message to that friend:

You also have the option to click a button that will give that person access to your posts, photos, videos and information in your ""about"" section -- basically everything except your personal messages.
If choosing legacy contacts isn't something you're interested in, Facebook also will let you delete your account after you die.
Facebook isn't alone in trying to solve the digital data management problem after you die.
In 2013, Google (GOOGL, Tech30) began allowing people to assign beneficiaries of their Google accounts. The Inactive Account Manager will send you a text message and an email if you haven't logged into Gmail, Google Maps, Google Drive, YouTube or any other Google apps for a set amount of time -- between three months and 18 months.
If you don't respond to Google's alert, Google will send your Google account data to a trusted contact or contacts. You can choose which Google services they're allowed to see -- or you can just delete you account, if you wish.

Jon Stewart, whose wit defined ""The Daily Show"" for more than 15 years, will sign off the iconic Comedy Central program later this year.
""In my heart I know it is time for someone else to have that opportunity,"" he said on Tuesday night's show as his studio audience gasped.
Members of the audience yelled ""we love you Jon"" as he expressed his appreciation for the show's staff and called hosting it ""the honor of my professional life.""
It isn't clear when Stewart will sign off; his contract expires in September, but he may leave as soon as July, or as late as December, he said.
In a farewell statement, Michelle Ganeless, the president of the channel, called Stewart ""a comic genius, generous with his time and talent,"" and said the host ""will always be a part of the Comedy Central family.""
Related: Did Comedy Central let its three biggest stars slip away?
Speculation about potential successors started immediately. ""The Daily Show"" is Comedy Central's single most important brand, and it's not going anywhere.
Ganeless said the show ""has become a cultural touchstone for millions of fans and an unparalleled platform for political comedy that will endure for years to come.""
But it will not be the same. Stewart replaced Craig Kilborn as the host of the 11 p.m. ET news satire in 1999 and made the show his own. It is strange to imagine anyone else sitting in his chair.
So Tuesday's announcement was met with a mix of shock and even sadness as many on social media braced for a satirical future without Stewart. Twitter said there were more than 130,000 tweets sent about Stewart's departure between 6:30 and 8 p.m. ET, when the news initially spread.
""Shocked & sad to see the man who gave me my big break on @TheDailyShow is ready to hang it up,"" tweeted actor Josh Gad. ""Can't wait to see what's next!""
Related: How Jon Stewart changed politics
Others observed that TV wasn't just losing a late-night comedy host, but also a sharp-eyed media critic, a man who regularly challenged and mocked news outlets like CNN.
""No way to put a figure on his value to [Comedy Central],"" tweeted former New York Times TV reporter Bill Carter. ""He literally put that network on [the] map personally. Truly irreplaceable.""
And he helped the careers of a whole universe of other comedians, as well.
Over the years Stewart influenced the worlds of news and comedy with his wickedly funny monologues and probing interviews, and he sometimes showed that the two worlds aren't as far apart as they might seem.
Stewart was often credited with educating his fan base -- which includes many millennials -- about the news, even if only unintentionally.
A 2006 study proposed something called ""The Daily Show Effect,"" where Stewart's humor has a positive effect on political participation.
Under Stewart's leadership, ""The Daily Show"" won 20 Emmys, making it one of the most acclaimed shows on TV.
When Stewart signed his most recent contract in 2012, it came as a surprise to some observers, given his long tenure at the program and his publicly expressed interest in trying other things. He recently directed his first feature film.
In a series of interviews to promote his film, ""Rosewater,"" in November, Stewart acknowledged that he had been contemplating his future.
When a New York magazine reporter asked whether the 2016 presidential election might motivate Stewart to stay at ""The Daily Show,"" Stewart said yes.
But he added, ""Part of the thing to remember is this is not the only process by which you can work material, and sometimes it's more important to step back and reconfigure a conversation than continue the same conversation because you know how to do it.""
On Tuesday night's show, Stewart said he doesn't ""have any specific plans"" -- perhaps pre-empting inevitable questions about his future.
He acknowledged that he's been eyeing other work, saying, ""This show doesn't deserve an even slightly restless host and neither do you.""
Stewart also thanked his bosses at Comedy Central, which is owned by Viacom, and remarked that ""17 years is the longest I have ever, in my life, held a job, by ... 16 years and five months.""
Stewart's announcement came two months after his longtime late-night companion on the channel, Stephen Colbert, ended the ""Colbert Report."" Colbert will take over CBS's ""The Late Show"" this fall.
Colbert's successor Larry Wilmore started a new program, ""The Nightly Show,"" that now follows ""The Daily Show.""

2015-02-25 11:58:48,"Disney's 'DuckTales' returning to TV in 2017 - Feb. 25, 2015 ",http://money.cnn.com/2015/02/25/media/ducktales-disney-revival/index.html,"""DuckTales"" (oooh oooh!) is coming back to TV.
Disney Channel announced on Wednesday that the beloved late 1980s animated series will be returning to TV in 2017 with all new adventures on its teen-orientated channel, Disney XD.
Produced by Disney Television Animation, the new series will bring back fan favorite Scrooge McDuck along with his grandnephews Huey, Dewey, and Louie as they travel around Duckburg solving mysteries and rewriting history.
""DuckTales' has a special place in Disney's TV animation history,"" Marc Buhaj, Disney XD's senior vice president of programming said in a statement. ""Our new series will bring that same energy and adventurous spirit to a new generation.""
For kids that grew up in the late 1980s eighties and early 1990s, ""DuckTales"" was a popular cornerstone of Disney's syndicated daily cartoon lineup.
The Emmy Award-winning series, which ran from 1987-1990, produced 100 episodes.
The series also hatched a 1990 feature film, ""DuckTales the Movie: Treasure of the Lost Lamp,"" an Indiana Jones-esque adventure starring the ducks.
Fans of the series will also be happy to hear that characters like Duckworth, the Beagle Boys, and Launchpad McQuack will also be apart of the new series.
The animated show was based off of the Uncle Scrooge comics by artist Carl Barks.
""['DuckTales'] drew its inspiration from Disney legend Carl Barks' comic books, and through its storytelling and artistic showmanship, set an enduring standard for animated entertainment that connects with both kids and adults,"" Buhaj added in a statement.
The original ""DuckTales"" episodes are currently available on the WATCH Disney Channel mobile app.

Someday maybe you can - Feb. 26, 2015 ",http://money.cnn.com/2015/02/26/news/companies/laguardia-flights/index.html,"New York business travelers may soon get the long-distance flights they need from the nearby airport they prefer -- LaGuardia Airport.
LaGuardia has had a 1,500-mile restriction on most flights to and from the airport for more than 30 years. For travelers going to the West Coast, Las Vegas or Phoenix, that meant you have to fly through John F. Kennedy or Newark Liberty airports. There are some loopholes in the rule, though, such as one that allows direct flights to and from Denver.
LaGuardia is about 10 miles from midtown Manhattan, while the other airports are each about 16 miles -- a big difference in New York traffic.
The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns and operates all three airports, is studying the 30-year-old rule to determine if it remains in the best interest of the region's air travelers, according to a statement. Any change would have to go through only after a ""thorough study and analysis and consultation with all interested parties,"" the Port Authority said.
The rule came about because the Port Authority wanted to encourage airlines to fly in and out of JFK and Newark airports at a time when LaGuardia was already at capacity.
Related: How to avoid air travel misery
The rule change would probably benefit business travelers the most since they willing to pay higher fares for the convenience of going to their preferred airport. It would make it harder though to get a direct flight to many smaller airline markets.
Gates and slots are limited at the three New York airports. If an airline is going to start providing the more lucrative transcontinental flights from LaGuardia, it is probably going to come at the expense of those smaller markets.
A change would also be a boon for Delta Air Lines (DAL) and American Airlines (AAL), the two major carriers at LaGuardia, and a set-back for United Continental (UAL), which has a hub at Newark, and JetBlue Airways (JBLU), which is based at JFK.

2015-02-08 09:00:19,"Why Chinese moms want American babies - Feb. 8, 2015 ",http://money.cnn.com/2015/02/08/news/china-birth-tourism/index.html,"For many pregnant women, a pre-birth checklist might look like this: assemble the crib, buy extra bibs, pack essentials for the hospital. But for a growing number of expectant Chinese mothers, the list also includes buying a plane ticket to the U.S.
Felicia He, 27, shelled out tens of thousands of dollars and planned meticulously before hopping on a plane to give birth in California.
""I started getting ready for the trip around the end of my first trimester,"" she recalled. ""I asked my friends who have given birth before in the U.S. for a doctor recommendation; then I found a place to stay in the area for a few months, and purchased my plane ticket.""
Pregnant Chinese moms are flocking stateside to give birth, lured by rules that grant American citizenship to anyone born on U.S. soil. A booming birth tourism industry has sprouted from coast to coast to cater to growing interest -- in 2012, about 10,000 Chinese women gave birth in the U.S., more than double the 4,200 in 2008, according to Chinese state media.
Many of the families want an American kid because a foreign passport could be the family's ticket out of China if they grow weary of pollution or food safety scares. President Xi Jinping's widespread anti-corruption campaign has given rich Chinese yet another reason to be on edge.
""If things become economically or politically uncertain in one's country of origin, the children have a place to come to,"" said Leti Volpp, a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley. The children can ""then sponsor their parents when they turn 21.""
The desire to leave China is especially pronounced among the wealthy. Almost two-thirds of Chinese with more than 10 million yuan ($1.6 million) in the bank have emigrated, or are planning to, according to a Hurun report released last year.
Related: Chinese courts are selling seized assets on Alibaba's Taobao
For He, who gave birth last year, a U.S. passport for her baby means access to better education opportunities. Foreign status opens the door to exclusive international schools in Beijing, where she lives with her husband, and the option for the child to study abroad for high school and college.
For others, like Miao, giving birth in the U.S. can also be a way to skirt China's one-child policy. Although the rules have been relaxed slightly, not every couple is eligible to have multiple children.
Miao estimates she spent nearly $30,000 to have her second child in the U.S. Like He, she plans to send her daughter to study in the U.S., perhaps as early as elementary school.
To make the process easier, Miao enlisted an agency that helped her find a short-term rental in a Los Angeles neighborhood popular with pregnant Chinese.
Related: Rich Chinese overwhelm U.S. visa program
A number of such agencies exist, with websites and ads touting elaborate birth packages at ""maternity hotels"" that include luxury accommodation, meals, chauffeurs, doctor appointments and more. The websites even explain how to secure a passport for a newborn and where to apply for a visa.
While many mothers give birth in the Lower 48, U.S. territories like the Northern Mariana Islands are also popular. The islands are close to China, and there is a visa waiver program for Chinese tourists.
Birth tourism has exploded so quickly there that its congressman, Rep. Gregorio Sablan, has repeatedly pressed the U.S. government to help implement controls, such as pre-screening measures, to curb the influx of pregnant moms.
Both the Miao and He families have mulled plans to emigrate to America, drawn by the lower cost of living. Housing is more affordable, especially in comparison to Beijing, where prices continue to climb.
There is one catch, though. Getting a U.S. passport for a baby means the child will eventually be responsible for U.S. taxes.
""I haven't thought that far yet,"" He said. ""And anyway, we have to wait until my baby is 18, right?""

The economy has added nearly 3.3 million jobs in the past year. In February alone, 295,000 jobs were created -- beating expectations soundly.
And it gets even better: the U.S. has been adding jobs in many industries -- another sign that things are moving in the right direction.
If you're looking for employment, it's helpful to think about what fields are growing and where the highest wages are.
In the past year, retail, health care and service jobs such as lawyers and accountants saw the most job growth. On the downside, employment in the energy sector is slowing down after years of gains.
Here's a rundown of what could happen in 2015:
Related: 12 jobs with big paychecks
Foodie boom: The kale, quinoa and craft beer craze might explain why restaurants and bars are big job drivers. The food sector added 59,000 jobs in February, and it's gained almost 450,000 jobs in just the past 12 months.
But it's no secret waiters and waitresses earn low wages and rely on tips. Although the job growth is good, it exemplifies one of the job market's biggest problems: the quality of new jobs. Workers earning low wages can't spend much.
Despite that warning flag, one promising sign for high-quality job growth is your local tax man.
Share your story: Are you a part-time worker?
The service economy: Accountants may not be supermodels, but they are illustrating an important shift for America's economy. Businesses such as law, engineering and accounting are now the big drivers of growth, reinforcing the narrative that the U.S. is a service economy and no longer a manufacturing one.
The country added over 700,000 service jobs last year, and continued that tear in February, notching another 51,000 new positions. These are mostly well-paid jobs that are expanding in numbers quickly. Look for the service sector to play an increasing role in the identity and progress of the country's economy.

Health care: Love or hate Obamacare, lots of new jobs are arriving at hospitals and health centers across the country. Since Obamacare became law in March 2010, health care has gained about 1.2 million jobs. The industry is helping to drive U.S. job growth.
But there's a catch to Obamacare: while it's spurring new health jobs, it's also causing companies to cut back hours on their part-time employees.
A new provision of the law that began in January stipulates that companies must offer health insurance to employees working 30 hours or more a week. Big box stores like Walmart (WMT) and Home Depot (HD) are reducing hours for part-time employees to less than 30 a week, most likely to avoid health care costs.
The number of part-time workers who want full-time jobs is still 40% higher now than when the recession began in December 2007.
Still, health care's job growth is an overall positive for the economy.

Energy: Where it isn't going so well is the energy sector. Most Americans love that a gallon of gas costs about a dollar less now than a year ago, but that cheap gas is also costing the country some jobs, at least in certain fields.
Falling gas prices are forcing energy companies to cut back on high-paying jobs. This negatively impacts many Midwest towns whose businesses -- from home building to new schools -- rely on the oil business. The cheap gas that many Americans benefit from hurts the employment picture in these towns.
Energy jobs tumbled for the second straight month in February. Although the drop was modest, it's a concerning sign since they drove a lot of economic activity in the Midwest the past few years.
The U.S. economy already has a lack of new jobs that offer high wages. The slowdown in good gas jobs reinforces concerns that America has a quality of jobs problem.
The good news: if energy employment continues to fall, other industries that benefit from cheap gas such as manufacturing and trnasportation might pick up the slack.

A report by The Intercept claims spy agencies from the U.S. and U.K. jointly hacked into the world's largest manufacturer of SIM cards in order to monitor mobile phones around the world.
The Intercept was co-founded by Glenn Greenwald, the former Guardian journalist who worked with Edward Snowden to reveal the National Security Agency's huge spying program.
Citing documents provided by Snowden, it claimed the NSA and its U.K. equivalent hacked into Gemalto to get hold of the encryption keys that allow access to SIM cards across the globe.
Based in the Netherlands, Gemalto reportedly makes two billion SIM cards per year. Clients include AT&T (T, Tech30), T-Mobile (TMUS), Verizon (VZ, Tech30), Sprint (S) and about 450 other global telecom firms, according to the report. It also makes chips for credit cards and works with over 3,000 financial institutions.
The company, which prides itself on its top-notch digital security, said it was not aware of the hacking, which ran from 2010 to 2011. It is investigating the report.
""We cannot at this early stage verify the findings of the publication and had no prior knowledge that these agencies were conducting this operation,"" the firm said in a statement.
Shares in the company dropped 7.5% in morning trading in Europe.

Snowden, a former contractor at the NSA, leaked classified documents containing information about the agency's widespread spying operations in 2013.
U.S. federal prosecutors subsequently charged Snowden with espionage and theft of government property.
The whistleblower has been living in Russia under asylum since 2013. In August 2014, his attorney said he was granted an extension to stay in Russia for three more years.

Actor Leonard Nimoy -- Spock -- died last week, but he lives on, as Canadians leave their tribute to the ""Star Trek"" legend on the face of Canadian currency.
In other words, Canadians are sketching a Spock-style bowl haircut with pointed 1960s sideburns over the mostly hairless pate of Sir Wilfrid Laurier, who was prime minister of Canada from 1896 to 1911.
Laurier's face adorns the $5 bill, the lowest denomination of Canadian paper currency. With a bit of scribbling, he does sort of resemble Nimoy, the oxymoronic author of two autobiographies: ""I Am Not Spock"" and ""I Am Spock.""
The artist community Canadian Design Resource, for example, called on its Twitter followers to ""Spock your $5 bills for Leonard Nimoy.""
""That is highly illogical ... I mean 'illegal,'"" Tweeted Tom Megginson, in a nod towards Nimoy's song ""Highly Illogical,"" where the Vulcan-human hybrid complains about the emotionally charged mating rituals of homo sapiens.
Another Twitter follower complained, ""Damn new polymer notes. Too hard to write on.""
Just for the record, Nimoy was from Boston and Los Angeles, not Canada, and Spock was from Planet Vulcan.

Issac's Singapore-based company, Polychemy, is using 3-D printers to make personalized jewelry -- think nameplate necklaces available in a dozen languages, or sports team logo pendants. And forget fashion shows -- he's getting his design cues from big data.
""We're a very data-driven company; we analyze what people are searching for on Google,"" Issac said. ""People are searching for things that are very specific -- for example, a gold ring with a diamond, ring size 8.5. We try to measure the demand, and then we develop that type of jewelry.""
Experts say Issac has tapped into a sweet spot, and that specialized companies like Polychemy will see the biggest growth as the 3-D printing industry explodes. The overall market for 3-D printed goods is expected to quadruple to $16.2 billion by 2018, according to tech research firm Canalys.
Because it's still too expensive and complicated to use high-quality 3-D printers at home, commercial outfits will be in demand as consumers look for ways to produce original designs.
Related: 3-D printed organs are on the way
3-D printing is a great technique for producing jewelry, because ""what people want is something special, and there's nothing better than to produce something with someone's name on it, a symbol that is important, perhaps even a picture or an object valuable to the person,"" said Joe Kempton of Canalys.
So how exactly does a 3-D printer make luxury jewelry?
At Polychemy, 3-D printers produce a wax mold that is cast into metal; gems are then set before the entire piece is polished.
Polychemy has about 40 customizable jewelry designs that sell for $100 to $250 apiece, and customers have their pick of precious metals, gems and text. One software program generates a unique snowflake design from a few billion possibilities each time a user clicks refresh. ""You'll never get the same one, just like a real snowflake,"" Isaac said.

Customers can go for a necklace pendant of a QR code -- a square barcode that can be scanned with devices, such as a smartphone. Issac said one customer even encrypted his Bitcoin wallet on the QR code pendant.
Like many other entrepreneurs, Issac has his sights set on China's growing e-commerce industry and 1.4 billion consumers -- he expects Polychemy's Chinese nameplate necklaces to be a hit.
""We realized that there was [online] search traffic for name necklaces in other languages -- Japanese, Korean, Chinese,"" he said. ""Most companies don't do this because it's too niche ... but we can combine all the niches together and capture a lot of this market.""

Justices will hear arguments Wednesday on whether most Obamacare enrollees can keep their subsidies.
A ruling against the Obama administration could send Obamacare into a death spiral.
It's likely that millions of enrollees would drop coverage after losing their assistance, experts said. Insurers would stop offering coverage or be forced to hike rates - by more than 250% by one estimate. Many remaining customers could leave the market after their premiums soar.
""The market would likely melt down very quickly,"" said Larry Levitt, senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation. ""The individual insurance market would be unable to function.""

Related: Obamacare at the Supreme Court: Justices divided over landmark health law
Here's the case in a nutshell: The Affordable Care Act called for the establishment of exchanges through which Americans can purchase health insurance. Those who earn less than four times the poverty level can qualify for subsidies to help pay their monthly premiums.
Only 16 states and the District of Columbia created their own exchanges, leaving the federal government to handle enrollment in the other 34.
The case, King v. Burwell, revolves around whether enrollees in these 34 states can receive federal subsidies. The challengers argue that the section of the law governing subsidies -- which refers to exchanges ""established by the State"" -- applies only to the 16 states with their own exchanges.
Here's what's at stake: Some 7.5 million people have signed up for 2015 coverage on the federal exchange, healthcare.gov, and qualified for subsidies, as of mid-February, according to Kaiser Family Foundation calculations. The subsidies average $268 a month, covering 72% of the premium. Enrollees shell out $105 a month, on average.
The subsidies are key to keeping the system afloat. They serve as a carrot to attract a wide range of people -- most importantly, younger and healthier ones who might not opt for coverage if it were too pricey. They also soften the blow of the individual mandate, which requires nearly all Americans to have coverage or pay a penalty.
""The subsidies establish a stable risk pool,"" said Dan Mendelson, founder of Avalere Health, an advisory firm. ""There are a lot more people in the exchanges because of the subsidies.""
Billye Moutra and her husband couldn't afford their UnitedHealthcare plan if they didn't receive $901 in monthly subsidies. The Missouri City, Texas, couple have multiple medical issues and work part-time jobs to make ends meet.
""When the Affordable Care Act came along, it was an answer to our prayers, especially the subsidies,"" said Moutra, 59, who is in an air cast and on crutches for a torn tendon in her right foot.
Related: Obamacare sign ups top 11 million
For breast cancer survivor Melanie Goff Bradley, however, going without health insurance is not an option, even though it would be tough to afford without her $250 monthly subsidy. Goff Bradley, 58, pays only $429 a month for her Blue Cross Blue Shield plan.
The Rocky Mount, N.C., resident is finishing a degree in health information technology after her employer of 32 years shut down. If she lost her subsidy and couldn't quickly find work in her new field, she'd have to take a minimum-wage job or work as a waitress to pay for coverage. The thought of losing her insurance scares her.
""You don't know when the next thing is going to happen,"" she said, of her health.
For the Obama administration, there is no Plan B. ""We know of no administrative actions that could, and therefore we have no plans that would, undo the massive damage to our health care system,"" Health Secretary Sylvia Burwell wrote to Congress members last week.

The upscale burger joint's shares surged nearly 120% Friday in their debut on the New York Stock Exchange.
Shake Shack (SHAK) priced its initial public offering at $21 a share Thursday evening -- above the price range Shake Shack set earlier this week. It opened at $47.21 and quickly shot above $50 a share. But it closed near its lows for the day.
The company raised $105 million from the stock sale. And at Friday's closing price of just under $46, Shake Shack is worth $1.63 billion.
Shake Shack shared some of the wealth with customers too. To celebrate its first day as a public company, Shake Shack offered free breakfast sandwiches and burgers at a food truck outside the NYSE.
Restaurateur Danny Meyer, who is chairman of Shake Shack and founder of the Union Square Hospitality Group that started Shake Shack, owns a 21% stake in the company. His share is now worth $341.5 million.
Meyer thanked employees and fans in a tweet Thursday night.
""#Gratitude. Team, Guests, Community, Suppliers, and Investors. In that order. Thank you all,"" he wrote.
Shake Shack, which started in 2001 as a hot dog cart in New York's Madison Square Park, has quickly become a Big Apple icon.
Expanding ... but not too quickly. The company currently operates just 63 restaurants worldwide -- but 16 of them are in the metropolitan New York City area.
Shake Shack has already planted outposts in several global markets, such as London, Moscow, Kuwait, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates.
And the company has said that it wants to expand relatively slowly. It is targeting 10 new locations in the U.S. a year as well as more international locations.
Related: 8 of the world's craziest fast foods
The strategy has been extremely successful so far. Shake Shack reported revenue of $83.8 million in the first three quarters of last year, an increase of more than 40% from the same period in 2013.
Shake Shack is also profitable. But net income fell in the first nine months of 2014, primarily due to higher costs for paper, food and labor as the company opened more locations.
Profiting from the problems at Mickey D's? Still, Shake Shack appears to be doing well at the expense of McDonald's (MCD). The CEO of McDonald's announced his retirement this week following another quarter of bleak sales.
Related: McDead? More lousy results from McDonald's
Shake Shack bills itself as a ""fine casual"" dining chain, a play on the fast casual term popularized by Chipotle (CMG) and Panera (PNRA).
In addition to having the backing of star chef Meyer, Shake Shack says in its IPO filing that it prides itself on using ""sustainable ingredients, such as all-natural, hormone and antibiotic-free beef.""
The proof is in the prices. A typical burger at Shake Shack can cost twice as much as a Big Mac.
Related: $7.54 for a Big Mac? Only in Switzerland
Shake Shack also differentiates itself from other burger restaurants by selling hot dogs, beer, wine and -- of course -- frozen custard shakes.
Investors are clearly hungry for restaurant IPOs.
El Pollo Loco (LOCO), Potbelly (PBPB), Noodles (NDLS) and Zoe's Kitchen (ZOES) have gone public in the past two years and soared on their first day of trading.
There is a lot of competition in the burger wars. But those four stocks are now well off their highs.
So is Habit (HABT), a popular California burger chain that went public last November and more than doubled in its debut.
Habit may not be as well-known to New Yorkers as Shake Shack. But its burgers were voted best in America by readers of Consumer Reports last year.
To that end, competition could prove to be the biggest risk for Shake Shack.

Even though its burgers are delicious, so are ones made by privately held Five Guys, Smashburger, Bareburger, In-N-Out and many other regional and national upstarts.
Heck, Sonic  (SONC)is doing really well lately thanks to strong demand for its burgers.
But pricey burgers could wind up being another culinary fad too. Krispy Kreme (KKD) was a hot IPO when the doughnut chain went public in 2000. But the stock is now trading more than 60% below its all-time high.
Shake Shack has already satisfied the palates of hipster burger gourmands. But now it has to deal with the fickle tastes of Wall Street traders and hedge funds too."

Apple (AAPL, Tech30) and HBO struck a deal. Starting in early April, the $14.99 monthly service will let users stream HBO movies and TV shows on iPads, iPhones and Apple TV -- without having to sign up for a cable subscription at all.
This is the first time that HBO is allowing for standalone service. (But it's only in the United States.)
""This is a transformative moment for HBO,"" said HBO Richard Plepler.
The deal comes just in time for the fifth season of Game of Thrones, which starts April 12. But outside of Apple devices, it's unclear how else you can get HBO Now.
HBO said it's currently working on deals with Internet providers. If it strikes deals with companies like Comcast (CMCSA) and Time Warner Cable (TWC), you might be able to order HBO Now as part of your broadband Internet package -- and stream it on any approved device.
Apple device owners can buy HBO Now no matter what happens. Want to stream it on your PC? You must own at least one Apple device.
As for other home streaming devices, like Roku, Xbox and PlayStation? HBO struck an exclusive, three-month device deal with Apple, so those devices won't be getting HBO Now until early July. And even then, that's only if they cut deals with HBO.
HBO is owned by Time Warner (TWX), which is the parent company of CNNMoney.

Now the alarm has spread to China. The People's Bank of China slashed interest rates at the weekend to keep prices from weakening too quickly.
""[The central bank] has clearly become more concerned about deflationary pressure in recent weeks,"" said Tao Wang of UBS. Inflation is now running at 0.8% in the country, a five-year low.
What's so bad about paying less for stuff? Consumers are right to cheer -- so long as their country is experiencing ""good deflation."" In places where price declines have been driven by falling energy prices, for example, people can save a little more or spend a little more.
Technological advances can also result in price reductions. Flat-screen TVs or cameras, for example, are much cheaper now than just a few years ago. For the same price, customers walk away with much improved products.

But economists are worried about something more sinister: The prospect that a harmful deflationary cycle could develop at a time when central banks are running out of ways to respond.
If households and businesses expect prices to stay depressed for a long period, they may postpone spending and investment, triggering a downward spiral in economic activity and prices. Deflation also makes it harder for countries to pay off debts, and can force weak economies to cut wages to compete globally.
Central banks would typically fight this cycle by slashing interest rates and pursuing other stimulus measures. But many have already cut rates as low as they can as they seek to recover from the global financial crisis.

In Europe, investors are so nervous that they are essentially paying for the privilege of lending money. The idea is that should deflation take hold, government bonds with negative yields may be a safer bet than other assets.
The European Central Bank is about to start buying 60 billion euros of bonds a month, and that has driven yields lower. It hopes banks and investors will be encouraged to seek higher returns elsewhere, by lending or investing in companies.
There is no panacea: Policymakers in Europe, for example, face interconnected problems, but anti-deflation policy prescriptions vary from country to country.
The problem, though, is now squarely at the front of the global agenda.
""Monetary policy has a limited effect in a serious deflationary environment,"" Scott Wren, an equity strategist at Wells Fargo, wrote last month. ""Even with interest rates at virtually zero, demand for credit is not robust as numerous central banks around the world are now learning.""
It's official: America has deflation"

Google (GOOGL, Tech30) said it has received a big backlash after deciding earlier in the week that bloggers will no longer be able to ""publicly share images and video that are sexually explicit or show graphic nudity."" The ban was to have taken place on March 23.
Instead, Google said that the company would simply double down on its crackdown of bloggers who use their sites to sell porn.
In July, Google stopped porn from appearing in its online ads that appear on Blogger. And in 2013, Google decided to remove blogs from its Blogger network that contained advertisements for online porn sites.
""We've had a ton of feedback, in particular about the introduction of a retroactive change (some people have had accounts for 10+ years), but also about the negative impact on individuals who post sexually explicit content to express their identities,"" wrote Jessica Pelegio, Google's social product support manager, in a post on Google product forums. ""So rather than implement this change, we've decided to step up enforcement around our existing policy prohibiting commercial porn.""
Google said blog owners who continue to host adult content should continue to mark their blogs as ""adult."" Visitors to those Blogger sites will see an ""adult content"" warning before they can enter.
The company said it was never its intention to completely ban nudity from Blogger.
Even under its now defunct ""graphic nudity"" ban, Google said it would have allowed nudity ""if the content offers a substantial public benefit, for example in artistic, educational, documentary, or scientific contexts.""
But that would have put Google in the position of deciding what is art and what is pornography -- a decision that Instagram and other sites have struggled with.
It's unclear how many sites would have been affected by the new rules. A spokeswoman for Google declined to comment.

2015-02-24 07:01:59,"8 tax audit red flags - Feb. 24, 2015 ",http://money.cnn.com/2015/02/24/pf/taxes/tax-audit-red-flags/index.html,"Budget cuts at the IRS may mean fewer audits this year. But that doesn't mean everyone will get away scot-free.
While chances are low that your return will be targeted by the IRS, why put yourself at risk at all?
Here are 8 relatively easy ways to steer clear of an audit:
1. Report all of your income. Wages from most jobs are reported on W-2 forms, while any interest, dividends and capital gains you made are reported on 1099s, as is income earned by independent contractors or freelancers.
Those forms are sent to both you and the IRS. So be sure to include all information from them on your federal tax return.
Here's why: The agency uses an automated form-matching program to flag discrepancies between what you report and what the IRS has on file, according to the National Association of Enrolled Agents, who are tax preparers authorized to represent clients in an audit.
Any discrepancies will trigger a correspondence audit. Basically, the IRS will send you a letter telling you how much more you owe based on the income you failed to report.
It's up to you whether to just pay the bill or challenge it if you think the IRS didn't calculate it correctly.
2. Run a small business? Prove it. Very few people make a profit when they first start their own business. The IRS understands this... up to a point.
Report losses for three or more years and the agency will start to suspect your business is more of a hobby than a venture aimed at turning a profit, said former IRS tax attorney Garrett Gregory of Addison, Texas.
Such ""hobby loss"" cases may trigger a field audit, which is in-person and more onerous than a correspondence audit.
Related: Filing a false tax return comes with big penalties
To prove you have a real business, be sure to keep records of your business expenses and document how much time you spend on the business and what you do with it.
You want to prove that you ""breathed it, ate it, slept it, drank it,"" Gregory said.
3. If anything seems weird, explain it. The IRS has its tentacles up for unreported income, so explaining anything that looks questionable may dissuade the agency from pursuing an audit.
For example, if your net income is too low to live on given such factors as where you live and your family size, include a disclosure statement detailing how you supported yourself, including any savings, loans or credit cards that you used to pay the bills, the NAEA recommends.
4. Watch the home office deductions. Typically your office is in one place -- either in a rental space or in your home. So don't report a deduction for both. (If you legitimately have offices in both places, explain why in a disclosure statement.)
If your rental expense is for a business storage unit or equipment, the NAEA recommends labeling that cost as a ""storage rental"" or ""equipment rental.""
5. Report the sale of mutual funds: If you sold a mutual fund that you bought before 2011 outside of a tax-advantaged retirement account and you reinvested the money in another mutual fund, you must report it on your federal return, said enrolled agent Stephen DeFilippis of Wheaton, Ill.
If you don't, the IRS will assume the total proceeds from the sale are all taxable gains. And it will send you a letter that recomputes your tax bill accordingly.
In that case, you'd need to go back and prove to the IRS that only a portion of the proceeds represent your capital gains and the rest was your cost basis (i.e.; the amount you originally invested in the fund). Or, if you sold the fund at a loss, that you don't owe any tax on the sale.
6. Come clean about any money overseas: U.S. taxpayers who have bank or investment accounts abroad must report any income they earned on those accounts to the IRS.
While that's always been the case, under the relatively new Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) your foreign financial institution may soon start to report that information to the IRS like any other bank or brokerage would in the United States.
If you've had the account for years, never reported it, and the IRS finds out about it from your foreign bank or investment firm, you could owe some serious penalties in addition to back taxes if the account has generated taxable income, Gregory noted.
Related: IRS will do fewer tax audits this year
To pre-empt such expensive surprises, the IRS has sponsored an offshore voluntary disclosure program that lets people come clean on their own volition and by doing so, reduce any penalties they may owe.
7. Report the sale of your home: When you sell your home, the title company will send you and the IRS a 1099-S form, recording the proceeds from the sale.
Even if all your capital gains on the sale are tax-exempt (because they didn't exceed $250,000 if you're single or $500,000 if you're married), DeFilippis recommends you report information from that 1099-S on your return anyway.
His reason: the 1099-S is part of the IRS form-matching program. Not reporting it may generate a correspondence audit.
8. Be smart about mortgage interest: When you own a home with your spouse, your lender will send you and the IRS a Form 1098, which records how much mortgage interest you paid during the year.
But sometimes the form only includes the name and Social Security number of one spouse, DeFilipis said. Should that person die, and the surviving partner tries to claim the mortgage interest deduction, that may trigger a correspondence audit.
So have the lender change the name and Social Security number on the 1098 before filing. Or, if there's not time for that before April 15, file for an extension and submit your return when you have an amended 1098 in hand."
2015-01-25 02:58:19,"I have a fiancÃ©, a girlfriend and two boyfriends - Jan. 25, 2015 ",http://money.cnn.com/2015/01/25/technology/polyamory-silicon-valley/index.html,"Miju Han lives in the Bay Area, works as a product manager and shares a charming apartment with her fiancÃ©.
Here's what makes her love story a bit different: She's also in three other relationships. In addition to her fiancÃ©, Han has been seeing a woman for two years (they recently said, ""I love you""). She also dates two other men.
Han, 27, says she never quite colored inside the lines. She grew up in the South, was attracted to women and fascinated by programming. In 2010, she moved to the Bay Area and has since worked at several major tech companies. Han declined to name her current employer.
She met her fiancÃ© when he was 21 and she was 23. They fell in love but weren't ready to cut off other options.
""He hadn't dated many other women in the past, and I wanted to explore too,"" she explained.
Han says the term for her relationship status is polyamorous, meaning ""many loves."" People who identify as polyamorous are often in multiple romantic relationships. The arrangements vary, but they have a lack of exclusivity in common.
Han and her fiancÃ© practice a hierarchical style of polyamory. Her fiancÃ©, who asked not to be named, is her primary partner, meaning all other relationships are secondary or more casual. They spend five to six nights a week together and plan on marrying in 2016 and having children at some point. Han's fiancÃ© is also dating three other women.
Han compares her experimentation with her relationship to the experimentation that happens in the Bay Area, a mecca for entrepreneurs who question the way things work.
""I think that in technology, people have higher appetites for risks,"" she says. ""Opening up your relationship is really risky, kind of in a similar way that starting a company is really risky.""
In fact, it's just a part of a rich history of sexual exploration in the Bay Area that far precedes the tech boom.
""There's still a lot of cultural taboo around open relationships and polyamory,"" says Polly ""Superstar"" Whittaker, who a started a private sex club called Mission Control in 2001. ""This is a town that accepts alternative structures.""
Chris Messina, an entrepreneur best known for coining Twitter's use of the hashtag, lays it out in numbers.
""We're a very data-driven culture, so if you're trying to build a product -- to draw an analogy -- and it's failing 50% of the time, you might want to consider the design and think about ways of improving it,"" Messina says.
Messina, 34, says his relationship status is somewhere between non-monogamous and ""monogam-ish.""

Related: Inside a high-tech swinger's party
""It's a constant, evolving, open, and transparent conversation between us,"" he says of his current relationship.
But one of the hardest issues many non-monogamous couples face is less analytical: Love is irrational and people are prone to jealousy.
""At the beginning, there was jealousy that we had to work through,"" Han says. ""We had to dig through with the irrationality of, 'Oh my gosh! You might leave me. How could you like this other person?'""
According to a University of Michigan study, 5% of couples in the United States identify as non-monogamous -- it's still a niche community. But the explosion of technology is lifting the curtain on these atypical structures.
Messina cites Reddit and an app called Secret as two of the many online places where people openly discuss alternative relationships.
""There are communities talking about these things and trying to figure out what they are ... with a degree of understanding that just never existed before,"" Messina says. ""It's like, 'Wow, my weird is not so weird. I can find a community of 100,000 people online where a couple years ago, I would have felt like the only one doing this.'""
San Francisco's culture (there's even a community class called ""Monoga-maybe"") makes it that much easier to be open. And Han said as a tech employee with a solid income and job security, she doesn't face repercussions like people in more traditional cities and industries.
""There really is a downside -- polyamorous people face real discrimination."" Han says. ""I have the luxury of talking about polyamory openly because, to be frank, I work in tech, and I could find another job if something were happening to me as a result of lifestyle choices.""
But the hardest thing for Han right now? Time.
""My dating calendar is very tight and my job is very demanding,"" says Han, who uses Google calendar to schedules her dates. ""It's hard to balance the relationships that I want to deepen with all the demands of my life.""

2015-01-18 07:12:10,"State of the Union spoilers: What you need to know about Obama's proposal for the middle class - Jan. 18, 2015 ",http://money.cnn.com/2015/01/18/news/economy/state-of-the-union-middle-class/index.html,"The White House has made it clear recently: President Obama intends to use Tuesday's State of the Union address to make a statement about where Democrats stand on a key issue ahead of the 2016 election -- the middle class.
Obama is expected to unveil proposals that would expand tax credits for parents, workers and students. And he'll call for paying for them by closing tax breaks on the the wealthy and hitting mega banks with new fees.
If the point is to start a debate, that has begun. If the point is to get his package passed as a whole, well, that's not going to happen.
Republicans with whom he's frequently been at loggerheads now control both houses of Congress. They are making it clear they disagree with Obama's approach. Representative Jason Chaffetz said Sunday on CNN they're a ""non starter.""
Below is a crib sheet on what the White House says Obama will outline. Let the debate begin!
Introduce tax credit for working couples: The White House says the aim of this proposal is to help families in which both spouses work, while defraying the costs of things like commuting and care for children or aging parents.
The White House says it would affect 24 million couples. The full value would be available to couples earning less than $120,000, while couples with income up to $210,000 would receive partial credits.
Require paid sick leave: Obama backs a proposed law that would allow workers who don't already receive paid sick time to accumulate up to seven days each year. (A study found more than 40% of workers in the private sector don't receive the benefit now.)
Related: I haven't gotten a raise in years
He is also instituting a new policy for federal employees: six weeks of paid leave for new mothers and fathers, and the same amount of time to care for an ill relative.
Expand child care tax credit: Childcare is expensive, and the federal incentives -- like flexible spending accounts and the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit -- offer a patchwork of support.
The White House says Obama's plan would ""streamline"" the options into a single credit. It would cover half of childcare costs with a maximum credit of $3,000 per pre-school child.
Encourage higher education: Obama's proposal would also expand the federal incentives for a college education.
The White House said the president would increase the maximum refund under the American Opportunity Tax Credit from $1,000 to $1,500. He would also make it permanent; it is currently set to expire in 2017.
Another part of his plan would answer a major tax concern of students who qualify for income-based loan repayment plans. After 20 years of income-based student loan payments under the Pay As You Earn plan, the remainder of the loan is forgiven, but students still owe tax on it. The proposal would also simplify the rules for federal Pell Grants and taxes on student loan interest.

Expand the Earned Income Tax Credit: There's something in Obama's proposal for working families without kids, too.
The Earned Income Tax Credit is available to low-income workers. But the credit is significantly smaller for a childless earner than someone with children.
Obama's proposal would give childless workers who are already eligible twice the amount they can currently claim. He would also expand it to include more low-income workers by raising the cap on claiming the credit -- currently at $14,590 for a childless single person -- and lowering the eligibility age from 25 to 21.
Encourage retirement saving: The president's retirement savings push is mostly targeted at companies.
His plan would expand access to retirement savings by requiring nearly all employers who don't currently offer an IRA to automatically enroll their employees in one. It would also require companies to accept more part-time employees into retirement savings plans.
Obama's plan also calls for tax cuts for companies that currently offer IRAs, begin offering IRS or automatically enroll employees.
That's on top of the myRA, a starter IRA for people who don't have a workplace retirement plan. It was unveiled in last year's State of the Union address and became available this year.
Related: Is Obama bank tax smart policy or bank bashing?
Tax inheritances like other capital gains: Obama also called for changing the way inheritances are taxed.
When individuals sell an investment, like a stock, they calculate the taxable value by subtracting what it was worth when bought from what it was worth when sold. (That's called ""capital gains."")
But when stocks are passed from one generation to another, the calculation changes: The person who inherits doesn't pay tax on capital gains during the previous owner's lifetime. That lets ""the wealthy pass appreciated assets onto their heirs tax-free,"" the White House said.
Obama wants to change that, unless the investment is donated to charity. The White House outlined several exemptions it says mean the change would mostly hit the wealthy, like allowing people to inherit a home and small businesses without another hefty dose of taxes.
He also wants to increase the tax on capital gains from 20% to 28%.
His other proposals: The president has been offering up State of the Union ""spoilers"" for two weeks now, like his proposals to make community college free for some students, increase internet speeds, and lower fees on government-backed mortgages. Some require Congress to act; others, like the mortgage plan, don't."
2015-02-06 11:35:13,"TurboTax restarts state tax filings after fraud concerns - Feb. 6, 2015 ",http://money.cnn.com/2015/02/06/news/companies/turbotax/index.html,"The popular TurboTax software restarted the e-filing of state tax returns on Friday after temporarily stopping them because of reports of fraud.
The company was concerned that criminals were using taxpayer's identity information (like a Social Security number) stolen from somewhere else to file fake returns via TurboTax and collect refunds.
In Minnesota and Utah, for example, some taxpayers had logged into TurboTax and saw that a return had already been filed under their name.
Intuit (INTU), the company that owns TurboTax, said it had a security firm do a preliminary examination and ""now believes these instances of fraud did not result from a security breach of its systems.""
The company began processing tax returns again at 6 pm ET after a temporary shutdown that started Thursday.
Federal returns, which have more stringent fraud controls in place, were unaffected by the outage.
The investigation is ongoing, Intuit said. And in the meantime it has beefed up its security technology to protect customers against ID theft.
About 29 million people used TurboTax to file their tax returns last year.
Related: Tax season unleashes cyberscams
Earlier Friday, Intuit spokeswoman Julie Miller said the company had heard from a ""small handful of states"" that saw an uptick in suspicious filings.
Miller declined to name the states, but Minnesota, Alabama and Utah all reported issues. Nineteen states in total identified similar problems, according to the Utah Tax Commission.
In Utah, 28 fraudulent returns were filed over the course of two days this week, the Tax Commission said. Another 8,000 were flagged as suspicious and are being investigated.
""That is off the chart for us,"" said Charlie Roberts, a spokesman for the state's tax commission.
Utah's fraud detection system indicates that whoever is filing the fraudulent claims probably has access to taxpayers' returns from previous years. The state said its own systems had not been compromised and could not say how a criminal could have gotten access to the previous year's filings.
But it warned that Utah taxpayers who filed state income tax returns electronically prior to 2014 through third-party vendors are potentially affected.
""Unfortunately, the bad guys have a lot of places to get information,"" Miller said.
All it takes to file a fraudulent return under someone else's identity is a name and Social Security number. The online black market is full of this type of information.
CNNMoney discovered last year that hackers stole more than 6.5 million Social Security numbers in 2014.
But possibly 80 million more were stolen so far this year from insurance giant Anthem (ANTM), which was was hit by a massive data breach. Hackers stole a database of names, birthdays, medical IDs, Social Security numbers, street addresses, e-mail addresses and employment information.
When someone claims your tax return fraudulently, it can take years for the IRS to complete its investigation and clear your name.
H&R Block, another tax preparer, said Friday that it was not having similar problems with state returns.
Intuit customers who believe they are victims of tax fraud can call 800-944-8596 for help. TurboTax said it will prepare taxes for affected customers for free, and provide identity protection services and free credit monitoring.

But how does his salary compare to those of other world leaders?
Here is how the pay of prime ministers and presidents of the big developed and emerging economies stack up, according to the most recent official data and converted into U.S. dollars at the current rate.
President Obama leads the pack with $400,000 a year. The presidential salary doubled when George W. Bush became president in 2001.
In addition, Obama gets a tax-free expense account worth $50,000.



Merkel's salary as German chancellor is set at 216,000 euros a year ($234,383). The chancellor and her ministers got a 2.2% pay rise at the beginning of March, according to government documents.


The British prime minister earns Â£142,500 ($214,782) a year. That includes his salary as a member of parliament, which is Â£67,060.


The French president would have ranked much higher on this list, had he not taken a 30% pay cut the moment he took office in 2012.
Without the haircut, Hollande would have earned 255,600 euros a year ($274,522), second only to Obama. Now he makes $194,251.

In the face of his country's worst economic crisis in years, Putin said last week he was cutting his salary by 10%. He now earns roughly 8.2 million rubles per year ($136,000) as Russian president.



The Indian prime minister's salary is just 1,900,000 rupees a year, which comes to little over $30,000. That's according to an official response to a freedom of information request submitted by local media.

He might be in charge of the world's second largest economy, but Chinese President Xi Jinping's salary is just $22,000. And that's after a 60% pay rise at the start of this year."
2015-02-16 05:20:10,"What we know about the bank hacking ring - and who's behind it - Feb. 16, 2015 ",http://money.cnn.com/2015/02/16/technology/bank-hack-kaspersky/index.html,"It looks like a few Russian hackers have just pulled off the biggest bank heist ever.
The numbers are shocking: hundreds of millions of dollars were stolen from 100 banks in 30 countries. The exact amount is unknown at this point. On top of that, the banks could lose possibly hundreds of millions more in related costs. And it all went mostly unnoticed until sometime last year.
On Monday, Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky released its report painting a startling picture of a worldwide operation that infiltrated major banks and turned ATMs into cash-spewing zombies.
What did they hit?
These hackers mostly attacked banks in Russia, but they also went after financial institutions in the United States, Germany, China and Ukraine, according to Kaspersky. The company declined to name specific banks, citing ongoing client relationships.
Kaspersky managing director Christopher Doggett said researchers managed to discover as much as they did by hacking into the hackers' computer servers.
""All of the cybercrime we've seen up until this point has been to a different level,"" he said.
What did they get?
Hackers managed to steal the money in all sorts of creative ways, Doggett said. They managed to take $7.3 million by reprogramming a single bank's ATMs. Another bank lost $10 million from its hacked online platform alone.
Then there's sensitive consumer data. The hackers were also deep enough in the computer systems at banks to gain information about their customers. For instance, hackers had full access to all email accounts at several Russian banks, according to Kaspersky.
Hackers also managed to obtain the secret keys that ATMs use to make sure your PIN is valid, Kaspersky said. It's unclear what they could do with such information.
How did they do it?
Hackers used botnets -- fleets of spam-spewing slave computers -- to send out wave after wave of malware-laced emails.
Bank employees who opened them inadvertently let hackers sneak into computers. The criminals eventually gained complete control of the systems using employee credentials.
With that authority, hackers opened accounts in different places and moved money around at will. Kaspersky notes that, in some cases, they used the interbank network SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) to quickly shift funds from one place to another.
By having full access to email exchanges, hackers also became intimately familiar with banks' anti-fraud measures. They also learned how to avoid setting off alarms.
For example, they limited theft at any single bank to $10 million to avoid triggering a full-blown analysis, Kaspersky's report said.
Then there's this painful realization: One bank could have avoided getting hacked in a particular way if its employees had just applied the usual Microsoft update, Doggett said.
Who is behind this
Kaspersky researchers traced this attack back to hackers in Russia, China and several spots in Eastern Europe, Doggett said. The report described them as criminals -- not a nation state -- and noted that they mainly targeted Russian-speaking banks with malware-laced emails in Russian.
But one Dutch Internet security firm, Fox IT, claims this attack bears all the hallmarks of a small group of Russian hackers that attacked Russian banks in a similar fashion last year. They used the same malware to break into bank computers, reprogram ATMs and hack into the payment systems at a dozen American retailers.
But Kaspersky said it's too early to tell if both hacking groups are the same.

He was 89, the company said in a statement. Multiple European news outlets said that for months he had been battling illness.
Italian President Sergio Mattarella called Ferrero ""entrepreneur bred"" and praised his ""innovative products"" and ""hard work.""
""We are proud of you. Thank you Michele,"" the company, Ferrero, posted to its website.
He was ""the richest candyman on the planet,"" according to Forbes, which put his wealth at $23.4 billion.
Ferrero's father, Pietro, turned the family pastry shop into a production facility back in the 1940s. Because of World War II, chocolate was rationed, so he mixed in hazelnuts to produce more product. The spread now known as Nutella was once six times less expensive than chocolate, according to the company.
The company soon became known for its distinctive products, like the namesake confections wrapped in gold foil.
It now produces tons upon tons of Nutella -- every year, an amount that weighs as much as the Empire State Building.
Ferrero products came to the United States in 1969. The first arrival was the Tic Tac mint. The company also produces Kinder chocolates.
The company is family-owned and run by Ferrero's son Giovanni.

2015-01-21 11:42:06,"Windows 10: Microsoft unveils new operating system - Jan. 21, 2015 ",http://money.cnn.com/2015/01/21/technology/windows-10/index.html,"Microsoft has lifted the curtain much higher on Windows 10, showing off a whole slew of new features that will be coming to PCs and phones later this year.
At its Redmond, Washington, headquarters on Wednesday, Microsoft (MSFT, Tech30) detailed how its new operating system will work across desktops, laptops, tablets, smartphones -- oh, and it's going to use holograms.
Microsoft understands that Windows 8 wasn't well-received by customers, and most of its updates to Windows 10 reflect that. It offers a much more familiar experience to Windows 7 users who never made the jump to Windows 8. But it also brings some innovations to the PC that tablet and smartphone users have become accustomed to. And by adding holographic representations to Windows 10, Microsoft is hoping to take Windows to a world beyond screens.
""Today really is a monumental day for Windows,"" said Terry Myerson, head of Microsoft's operating systems unit. ""Windows 10 is so much more than the latest version of Windows. Windows 10 changes the rules of the game.""
Like a smartphone or tablet upgrade, Microsoft's new operating system will be available as a free update for anyone using Windows 8.1. That's a big deal for Microsoft, which makes a tremendous amount of money on Windows sales.
Windows 10 is Microsoft's first major operating system upgrade since Windows 8 was introduced in 2012. Windows runs on more than 91% of the world's computers, according to NetMarketShare.
Live blog: Get up-to-the-minute details about Windows 10
Holograms. By far the coolest part of Microsoft's presentation was ""Windows Holographic,"" Microsoft's attempt to immerse its customers into a computerized world. Windows 10 has been built to integrate holographic representations of its software. With the companion HoloLens glasses, Windows 10 users can interact with holograms all around them.
HoloLens comes with a holographic processing chip that understands your gestures, voice and where you're looking. It can map the world around you and display holograms that appear to be in thin air or on objects that surround you.
With Windows 10's HoloStudio app, Microsoft lets users create 3-D objects with their voices and gestures (like pinches and flicks) and then print them on a 3-D printer.
Cortana. Microsoft's version of Siri will be part of Windows 10. By using voice commands, Cortana can show your notifications, stock information, sports news, and other functions typical of smartphone voice assistants.
But you can also say ""Hey, Cortana, show me PowerPoint slides about the charity auction"" or ""show me photos from December,"" and it will quickly run the search query.
No more Internet Explorer. Microsoft introduced a new, stripped-down browser that has been codenamed ""Project Spartan."" The new browser will ship with Windows 10, and it will function similarly to Chrome and Firefox.
The Spartan browser supports pen interactions, so people can mark up websites with their fingers or styluses and share them. Wit also features a reading mode and Cortana integration.
Spartan will be built on a different software platform from IE and the two are not compatible. That means Microsoft will continue to also ship IE with Windows to ensure that corporate apps continue to function properly.
Related: Internet Explorer must die
Return of the Start menu. After being removed from Windows 8, Microsoft announced that the Start Menu will make a full comeback in Windows 10.
The new Windows 10 Start menu includes a new personalizable space for favorite apps, programs and websites. It can be viewed as a full-screen Windows 8-like display of tiles or a more familiar Windows 7-like drawer of apps.
Continuum. The biggest Windows 8 headache that Windows 10 is expected to cure is the way the operating system manages its separate ""desktop"" and ""tablet"" modes. At its event, Microsoft introduced a new Windows 10 design interface called ""Continuum.""
Windows 10 sticks to desktop mode when it recognizes a mouse and keyboard and tablet mode when there is no keyboard and mouse. But hybrid devices, such as the Microsoft Surface, will be able to transition seamlessly between the two modes. Pull off the keyboard, and you'll enter tablet mode. Snap the keyboard back on, and you're back in desktop mode.
One Windows for all your devices. There are currently three different versions of Windows: Windows 8.1, Windows RT for tablets and Windows Phone. Last year, CEO Satya Nadella said Microsoft planned to scaling back.
Windows RT and Windows Phone are just becoming Windows 10. Windows 10 phones will be able to live-sync with Windows 10 PCs, and the apps will function similarly across different devices. They'll still be incompatible with most traditional Windows software, but they'll be able to run all of the apps from the Microsoft store.
Xbox. Microsoft said the new Xbox app for Windows 10 will let gamers stream and play Xbox games on their PCs. They can also play games from the Steam video game network and save and share game-play clips.
A new look for Windows. Microsoft said that Windows Store apps and regular desktop programs will both run in traditional windows in Windows 10. The programs can be resized and minimized from the bar at the top.
Windows 10 will feature something Mac users have enjoyed for years: the ability to create new desktops and quickly switch between them.
The new ""Snap"" feature will allow Windows 10 users to work on up to four apps at once on the same screen. Snap has been around since Windows Vista, but Microsoft redesigned it for Windows 10 to include a new quadrant layout.
And a new button on the task bar will take you straight to a single screen that displays all your open apps and files."
2015-01-27 10:38:48,"CNN and other media brands come to Snapchat - Jan. 27, 2015 ",http://money.cnn.com/2015/01/27/media/snapchat-discover-media-deals/index.html,"CNN and other major media companies are setting up shop inside Snapchat, the fast-growing messaging app that has big aspirations to showcase news stories and entertainment.
On Tuesday, Snapchat announced a new ""Discover"" section of its app and deals with almost a dozen different publishers that will program channels within it.
Stories within the Discover section will be viewable for 24 hours -- a whole lot longer than the usual blink-and-you-miss it Snapchat message.
CNN's channel will include five news stories a day, selected by CNN editors and producers.
""You'll be surprised by the amount of context we can include in the snaps,"" said Samantha Barry, head of social news for CNN. ""They are visually-led with great images and videos, but when you swipe up, you will get great CNN context with more images, text and background.""
The other publishers working with Snapchat include ESPN, National Geographic, Vice, Cosmo, Comedy Central, the Food Network, MTV, People, Yahoo News, and the Daily Mail. Some will promote news stories while others will publicize TV shows and entertainment content.
They all want more or less the same thing: to establish themselves on a new social network and experiment with something that is said to have more than 100 million monthly users.
""We're always seeking out new audiences and advertisers, and it's more important than ever to tailor content to suit the platform,"" Andrew Morse, senior vice president and general manager of CNN Digital, said in a statement.
The publishers also want to explore a new form of advertising. CNN, for instance, has sold an exclusive sponsorship for its Snapchat channel to BMW North America, according to a spokeswoman for CNN's parent company Turner Broadcasting.
Snapchat shares in the ad revenue that publishers earn from the snaps.
Snapchat has been working on the Discover feature for many months, and it's been something of an open secret in the industry. It's a crucial launch for the company as it strives to prove, like Facebook and Twitter before it, that it can make money through its communications platform.
Now the startup will have to persuade its users to try out its media partner's channels.
In an introductory blog post, Snapchat differentiated itself from competitors by saying ""this is not social media.""
""Social media companies tell us what to read based on what's most recent or most popular. We see it differently. We count on editors and artists, not clicks and shares, to determine what's important,"" it said.
The media partners were quick to praise the idea: Daily Mail North America CEO Jon Steinberg said ""I think the notion of channels and 'snaps' as news makes Discover something truly different than what anyone's seen on a social platform to date.""
Barry said that for CNN, ""there's a huge opportunity for us to reach new, younger audiences on Snapchat.""
""Let's assume that TV audiences are in their 50s, desktop audience are in the 40s, and mobile is maybe 10 years younger than that,"" she said. ""Being on Snapchat helps us reach every decade -- we are going to reach those people in their 20s andÂ younger on this platform.""
Barry dismissed the notion that young people are uninterested in hard news, calling it ""a myth that has been recycled every generation.""
""We just need to understand how different generations and demographics find, engage and share news,"" she said.
She said the expectation is that some consumers will discover what CNN is covering through Snapchat, then seek more information through CNN's television channels and web sites."

Instead the 63 year-old from Illinois got a bill in the mail addressed to Super B---- Bauer.
That's after months of battling with Comcast (CCV) to get her cable service fixed so she could watch her favorite channel.
""I said, wait, I need to get my glasses on because I don't believe what I'm seeing,"" Bauer told CNNMoney. ""And there it was: Super B---- Bauer. So I've had it with Comcast.""
Bauer had been having trouble with her cable service since last April and she had called Comcast customer service ""hundreds of times."" In fact, technicians came to her home on about 39 occasions and it was eventually fixed.
On top of this, Bauer said she didn't receive her bill in November. When it arrived, she found that her rate had jumped by $50. She called to complain and was told that her two-year contract (which included the Hallmark channel) had expired and the channel was now part of a more expensive package.
So, she agreed to pay the higher rate. When Bauer finally got the bill Wednesday, it was addressed to Super B---- Bauer.

This is not a first for Comcast. Last month, the company sent a bill to Ricardo Brown addressed to A--hole Brown after he canceled his cable service.
Bauer said she told a friend who works for a local television station about the offensive name on her bill. The friend passed the tip on and the station immediately contacted Bauer about the story.
However, it turns out that that station is owned by Comcast and the story was killed.

Bauer (pictured above) got in touch with another local station. The story was set to air at 9 pm, she said. Just a minute or so before the broadcast, Bauer said she got a call from an apologetic Comcast manager.
The company also sent a statement to CNNMoney: ""We are continuing to investigate this thoroughly, and have reached out to our customer to apologize and try to make it right.""
But that hasn't changed Bauer's views on the company.
""Comcast is just the most disingenuous company on the entire planet,"" she said. ""I've been totally frustrated with them for a very long time.""

Comcast has among the worst customer service rankings in the nation, according to the American Customer Satisfaction Index, topping only Time Warner Cable (TWC), a rival it is in the process of purchasing.
In September, a Comcast executive wrote on a company blog that it will take years before it can ""honestly say that a great customer experience is something we're known for."""
2015-01-20 06:18:28,"How you can already get money for community college - Jan. 20, 2015 ",http://money.cnn.com/2015/01/20/pf/college/free-college-tuition/index.html,"President Obama wants to make community college free -- but don't hold your breath.
Yes, his announcement went viral earlier this month, but this kind of change requires congressional action and Republicans now control both the House and Senate. Even if Congress acts, states could opt out of participating altogether.
For now, students need to come up with about $3,300 for a year at the average two-year college. And that only covers tuition and fees. Other expenses could ring up an additional $13,000, according to The College Board. Instead of waiting for Washington to make a change, here are other ways to foot the bill.
Pell Grants: The federal government gives out grants of up to $5,730 to about 9 million students a year. They can be used for tuition, fees, books and living expenses. It's based on financial need, and those making less than $60,000 typically qualify for at least some award, said Robert Kelchen, a professor of higher education at Seton Hall University. Students must submit the FAFSA form in order to be eligible.
Related: Obama wants community college to be free
Scholarships: Check the college's financial aid office, but don't forget about local groups that may offer awards based on special talents or interests. Some are merit-based, but others can be based on need, so be sure to fill out the FAFSA form early. Some states and colleges have a finite amount of money to dole out, and it's allocated on a first-come, first-serve basis each year.
Related: Colleges with the best bang for your buck
Think about a teaching career: You can get up to $4,000 a year from the federal government for pursuing a teaching degree. But you must agree to teach in a high-need field in a low-income area for at least four years after graduating, or you have to pay the money back.
Tax credit: Every student is eligible for a tax refund each year. Students making less than $80,000 are eligible for a maximum of $2,500. Of course, you still have to pay for tuition upfront before the credit comes your way.

Move to Tennessee or Chicago: There are already programs here that help cover the cost of community college, similar to the one proposed by President Obama. The state of Tennessee will cover the cost of tuition at a community college or technical school that's not already covered by Pell Grants and other state scholarships.
Chicago will similarly cover the remaining cost of tuition, fees and books. Students who earn a 3.0 GPA in high school, place into college-level math and English courses, and are accepted into one of the City Colleges of Chicago are eligible.

Ask your employer: Some companies, big and small, offer discounts on college tuition, but they often dictate which school is eligible. Starbucks (SBUX) offers some money to workers who take classes at Arizona State University's online program, and Wal-Mart (WMT) gives a discount to those taking classes at an online school called American Public University. Home Depot (HD) supports employees pursuing a degree at any accredited college, university or technical school.

2015-02-10 07:59:35,"Brian Williams suspended for 6 months - Feb. 10, 2015 ",http://money.cnn.com/2015/02/10/media/brian-williams-nbc-suspended/index.html,"""NBC Nightly News"" anchor Brian Williams is being suspended for six months without pay following revelations that he exaggerated tales from an Iraq War mission in 2003.
Tuesday night's announcement capped an extraordinary and painful six-day period for the network. Television veterans could recall nothing quite like it: a network benching the face of its news division to penalize him for what the CEO of NBCUniversal, Steve Burke, called ""inexcusable"" actions.
There is a widespread belief among rank-and-file NBC staffers that he may never actually return to the anchor chair he has held since 2004.
And if he does return, he'll return in a diminished capacity.
Related: Read NBC's statement about the suspension
Meanwhile, NBC's investigative unit is continuing to fact-check Williams' past reports, and could come up with more damaging revelations.
Still, Burke said in a statement, ""He deserves a second chance and we are rooting for him. Brian has shared his deep remorse with me and he is committed to winning back everyone's trust.""
Eight hours earlier, Williams visited Burke at the apartment Burke has on Central Park West in Manhattan. There, Tuesday evening's announcement began to take shape.
NBC News president Deborah Turness informed staffers of the network's suspension decision at a 7:15 p.m. meeting, held minutes after Williams' fill-in, Lester Holt, finished anchoring Tuesday's ""NBC Nightly News.""
""The suspension will be without pay and is effective immediately,"" Turness wrote in a memo.
Holt will continue to substitute-anchor the ""Nightly News."" An NBC source said Williams' name would likely be removed from the newscast's graphics later this week.
One rival executive speculated that NBC, by suspending Williams, was simply ""buying time for more negotiations"" that might lead to the anchor's exit.
Others, however, said it was quite possible he would stay put.
Within NBC News, shock about the announcement gave way to sadness and a general agreement that the news division is in the midst of its toughest period since the early 1990s, when journalistic lapses like a staged car accident for ""Dateline"" spurred soul-searching and management changes.
""I feel like I have just witnessed a sudden death,"" one longtime NBC News staffer said on condition of anonymity.
One NBC anchor called it ""humiliating for this whole network.""
Williams was, at least until last week, the single most popular news anchor in the United States. He reached about 10 million viewers a night. Just in December, NBC signed him to a new contract.
Several rival executives, speaking anonymously, said there was no joy to be had in Williams' befalling. ""Inside Edition"" host Deborah Norville said much the same thing on ""CNN Tonight.""
""There is no delight to be taken in this,"" Norville said, calling the blow to Williams' credibility ""also a blow for journalism.""
Related: Who is Lester Holt
For NBC News, the rolling calamity began last month when Williams paid tribute on his newscast to a soldier who had provided security to the anchor and his NBC crew in the desert on that day in 2003.
""The story actually started with a terrible moment a dozen years back during the invasion of Iraq when the helicopter we were traveling in was forced down after being hit by an R.P.G,"" Williams said on-air. ""Our traveling NBC News team was rescued, surrounded and kept alive by an armor mechanized platoon from the U.S. Army 3rd Infantry.""
Related: How Brian Williams' Iraq story changed
After a video of the segment was posted by the network on Facebook, several soldiers called out Williams for stretching the truth.
Williams, it turned out, had not been on the helicopter that was hit by an R.P.G.
Williams apologized last Wednesday, both on Facebook and on ""Nightly News,"" but what he said raised more questions than answers, and the controversy swelled over the next three days.
As skepticism mounted over Williams' claims about other reporting assignments -- namely his coverage of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 -- NBC News said Friday that it would conduct an internal investigation into the disputed accounts. Williams was once again in the anchor chair that night.
Related: Cronkite biographer on Brian Williams
But on Saturday, Williams said he had become ""too much a part of the news"" and that he planned to step aside from the newscast for ""the next several days."" Williams hunkered down even more on Sunday, canceling a scheduled appearance on the ""Late Show with David Letterman.""
By Monday, his attorney was in crisis meetings at 30 Rockefeller Center, where Williams' posters -- celebrating his first-place status in the nightly news wars -- hang on the walls.
Those meetings continued on Tuesday and ended with the suspension announcement.
On NBC's cable news channel MSNBC, Rachel Maddow covered the breaking news and told her viewers that ""NBC News will not make anyone available to discuss this story with us on the air.""
Over on Fox News, there were messages of support for Williams. Senior political analyst Brit Hume, a friend of Williams, told Megyn Kelly he hopes the embattled anchor pulls through this.
""I really like the guy, and I feel terrible for him tonight,"" Hume said.
""I think you speak for a lot of us,"" Kelly said.
The scribe who broke the news of Williams' recanted Iraq story last week said he wasn't celebrating the suspension.
""I don't get any satisfaction from seeing Brian Williams suspended,"" Stars and Stripes reporter Travis Tritten wrote on Twitter. ""Like the vets I spoke with, I just wanted to set the record straight."""

Meanwhile, Japanese electronics and Chinese clothing items are bobbing in the ocean within view of the shore.
The Pacific Maritime Association has accused the International Longshore Workers union of creating a work slowdown that has turned harbors into parking lots and shipping containers into putrid garbage bins.
Right now, the giant container ships that are the United States' pipeline of material to and from Asia are sitting idle in the ocean off of the West coast.
There's no labor or equipment available to load and unload goods, the port association says.
Negotiations between the management of twenty-nine West Coast ports and the longshore union began when the contract for around 20,000 port workers expired in July.
Empty shelves aren't a problem, yet.
That's because retailers planned in advance ""to make sure that it didn't interrupt the holiday shopping season,"" said Jason Brewer of the Retail Industry Leader's Association. But ""they're sort of running out of tricks,"" he added.
The ripple effects of the months-long contract dispute are, however, beginning to show up in less visible ways far inland.
Auto industry workers are running out of things to do.
Honda said on Monday it would ""stop or reduce production on multiple days"" at six facilities over the next week because of ""parts shortages."" Spokesman Mark Morrison said the company is running out of transmissions and electronic parts.
Toyota and Subaru also said they would modify their operations.
The makers of furniture and snowshoes are losing business. Salt, metals and electronics, bound for the U.S., are stuck at sea.
Companies whose products do make it through the ports are struggling to find independent truckers who can take their products on the next stretch of their journey, said Marianne Rowden, the president and CEO of the American Association of Exporters and Importers.
Exporters are struggling, too.
Among the largest exports from these ports are meat and dairy products, followed by other foods like produce and canned foods, according to an analysis from the National Retail Federation.
The North American Meat Institute said its industry is losing $85 million every week while cuts of meat and poultry sit in freezers, waiting to be shipped overseas.
Dairy producers export billions dollars of milk products to China, Japan and other Asian countries every year. Although much of that is powdered milk that has a longer shelf life, China also buys U.S. cheese, which can spoil. The situation is ""pretty dire,"" said Alan Levitt of the U.S. Dairy Export Council.
""In some cases (producers are) re-routing shipments through Gulf and East Coast ports, but that's costly and adds to the delivery time,"" Levitt said. ""There are no good alternatives.""
Apples and pears and that would normally be bound for Asia were also held up. These growers do much of their business from December through February, driven by demand around the Chinese new year.
In fact, Washington's apple crop is the largest in state history. Growers are dumping unused apples into canyons, according to Marc Spears of Chelan Fresh Marketing, which represents about 400 growers there.
About 70% of U.S. imports from Asia come through the impacted ports, and the National Retail Federation estimates the impact of a full strike or lockout could total $1.9 billion per day.
Some, however, say those costs are overstated because companies will eventually need to find alternative shipping methods.
""While (the ports are) one of the most important routes of goods getting in and out of the United States, it's not the only route,"" said Chris Thornberg of Beacon Economics.
But alternatives, such as routing ships to East Coast ports or shipping goods by air, is expensive.
What keeps the costs down for sea travel is size. The largest ships used by Maersk Line, the world's largest container shipping company, can be packed with 18,000 of the standard 20-foot containers.

2015-01-26 05:11:10,"Microsoft sales soar for all its non-Windows products - Jan. 26, 2015 ",http://money.cnn.com/2015/01/26/technology/microsoft-earnings/index.html,"Microsoft sales are growing for just about every product it makes ... except for Windows.
A couple years ago, that would have caused a panic -- Windows has been Microsoft's cash cow since 1985. In 2015, Microsoft (MSFT, Tech30) isn't sweating it too much. Microsoft would now much rather give Windows away for next to nothing to grow its customer base and support its other products.
The strategy is paying off: Microsoft's revenue grew 8% during the final three months of 2015, despite Windows sales tumbling 13% during the company's fiscal first quarter.
Part of the steep Windows drop is due to the fact that in the previous year, lots of businesses were buying Windows 7 and Windows 8 licenses after Microsoft killed off support for Windows XP.
And in an effort to add some much-needed juice to the moribund PC market, Microsoft was giving away Windows for free to tablet PC makers. Many laptops were selling for less than $300 during the holiday season as a result.
That's just fine with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. Microsoft doesn't want to lose customers to Apple (AAPL, Tech30) and Google (GOOGL, Tech30), as smartphones and tablets eclipse PCs as the go-to gadget for everyday use.
That's why when Microsoft releases its new Windows 10 software later this year, it will be a free update for smartphone, tablet and PC users on the current version of Windows.
""With our free upgrade offer ... developers will have a large, up-to-date user base to target,"" he said on on a conference call with analysts. ""I'm very happy with that strategy.""
A sales bonanza in a bevy of its other products gave the company more than enough of a boost to make up for the drop in Windows sales.
--Sales of Microsoft's Surface tablet were up 24% in the quarter, eclipsing $1 billion in revenue for the first time in the once-troubled tablet's history.
--Microsoft's cloud business more than doubled its revenue, and it is on pace to become a more-than $5 billion business for the company.
--Xbox won the holiday season, beating the Sony (SNE) PlayStation 4. Microsoft sold 6.6 million Xbox Ones, which is more than it sold a year ago. But Xbox revenue was down, because Microsoft no longer requires Xbox customers to buy the Kinect motion sensor attachment with the console, making it cheaper for people who just want the console by itself.
--The company's Office sales fell 1%, but the productivity suite's 365 subscription service is booming. It now has 9.2 million customers, up 30% from the previous quarter.
--Even businesses that hadn't historically performed well for Microsoft had strong quarters. Bing ad sales grew 23%, and Lumia smartphone sales totaled 10.5 million units, up 30% from over a year ago -- the best quarter for the former Nokia brand ever.
Microsoft's profit fell by nearly 11% to $5.9 billion, largely due to the ongoing restructuring at the company -- Microsoft cut 18,000 jobs last year. Excluding those one-time items, Microsoft earned 71 cents per share, in line with Wall Street analysts' forecasts.
Sales of $26.5 billion slightly exceeded analysts' expectations.
But Microsoft said the weak global economy and stronger dollar will weigh on future results.
Shares of Microsoft fell 4% after hours.

2015-03-02 04:51:06,"Malaysia hopes revamp will revive airline - Mar. 2, 2015 ",http://money.cnn.com/2015/03/02/investing/malaysia-airlines/index.html,"In an industry renowned for its brutal business cycles, nothing could have prepared Malaysia Airlines for last year.
Two tragedies -- one of which continues to play out as the world's greatest aviation mystery -- and the resulting avalanche of negative publicity has left the airline battered and bruised.
But not broken. Those who predicted the imminent demise of Malaysian Airlines in the wake of the disappearance of MH370 last March, and the shooting down of MH17 a little more than three months later, have been proved wrong.
One year on, the airline's immediate financial crisis is drawing to a close, and the company has developed a turnaround plan. In fact, the controlling shareholder now talks of a return to profit by 2017.
Aviation experts say the key now is to follow through on reforms.
Khazanah Nasional, the country's sovereign wealth fund, in November unveiled a five-year, $1.8 billion restructure. Key reforms included cutting unprofitable routes, putting in new senior management and slashing what is commonly described as a ""bloated workforce"". Six thousand employees are earmarked to go from a workforce of about 19,000.
""Although the tragedies have been devastating for MAS, they are also a catalyst for change,"" said Geoff Thomas of Flightratings.com.
""We are seeing signs today that they are at least looking at necessary steps to survive in the modern competitive world.""
Related: Why planes don't live stream data
But saying is one thing; doing is another. According to Maybank aviation analyst Mohshin Aziz, there are few signs yet that Kazanah is following through on the hard decisions. And there may be one simple reason for that: the plunging price of oil.
""Oil prices have just about halved and right now just about every route is making money. The momentum on the need to reform in a great hurry is definitely not there anymore,"" said Aziz.
Financial losses are also nothing new at the airline. It hasn't turned a profit since 2008. In the five years to 2013, cumulative losses are close to $1.5 billion, despite earlier attempts at restructuring and billions of dollars' worth of financial lifelines from the government.
What may be different this time around is that Khazanah has recruited a new CEO with a history of dramatic turnarounds.
Christoph Mueller comes from the Irish carrier Aer Lingus. He joined the carrier in 2009 when it was struggling in the face of tough competition and leaves it with a strong business model and consistent profits.
""Will he be able to ram through the sort of changes needed at MAS, or will there have to be a compromise,"" Thomas asked.
""There is a lot of pride attached by governments to their flag carriers, so there is likely to be opposition to a slimmed-down carrier that doesn't take Malaysia to the world.""
Related: Optimism and frustration as MH370 anniversary approaches
For Aziz, though, any meaningful reform has to include fewer routes.
Gulf carriers including Emirates have taken a big bite out or profitability in many of Malaysia's long-haul routes to Europe, while low-cost airlines like AirAsia have undermined the airline's regional strength.
One element the airline clearly has in its favor is a wellspring of loyalty at home.
""The airline is in our DNA,"" said Aziz. ""It's what we grew up with and Malaysians will always support it. It's part of us. And that accounts for something.""
The question is, can the airline marry that loyalty with hard-headed business decisions?

Cook's pay more than doubled last year to $9.2 million, according to a regulatory filing. His salary rose by a quarter to $1.75 million, and his bonus doubled to $6.7 million. Cook also cashed out vacation time he never took, for a total of $56,923. And he received nearly $700,000 in security expenses.
But his paycheck and perks are the least of it.
Also in 2014, $145 million worth of his previously announced stock awards vested. The shares were part of his welcome package when he took over as CEO in 2011.
Cook still has $536 million worth of stock awards from that package that have not yet vested. Cook will receive those shares over the course of the next six years.
Cook's pay package was valued at $378 million when he became Apple's CEO. But shares have risen so sharply over the past three years (mostly in 2014) that his stock awards are now worth $681 million -- an 80% increase.
Cook doesn't yet appear on either the Forbes or Bloomberg billionaire lists. But he may be there soon.
Despite his big payday, Cook was one of the lowest-paid executives at Apple (AAPL, Tech30) last year.
New Apple Store chief Angela Ahrendts got a $73.3 million pay package, most of which came in the form of stock awards that will vest over time. She also received a $412,000 salary and a $1.65 million cash bonus.
Apple gave Ahrendts nearly $800,000 to relocate to the company's Cupertino, California, headquarters. She had lived in London when she was CEO of Burberry (BURBY).
Other highly paid executives included software & services chief Eddy Cue, who made $24.5 million in cash and stock, as well as operations head Jeff Williams, who was paid $24.4 million.
New Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri got paid $14 million, and outgoing CFO Peter Oppenheimer made $4.5 million.
The company's executives were rewarded handsomely because Apple had a banner year.
Apple sold a record number of iPhones and Macs last year, and the company unveiled its plans for the highly anticipated Apple Watch. The company got into the mobile payments business with Apple Pay, and it made its flashiest acquisition in history when it bought Beats Electronics. Though iPad sales are slumping, the iPhone 6 Plus has sold well and represents Apple's answer to the phablet craze.
Bonus targets for the top execs were upped to 200% of executives' salaries (up from 100%) and their maximum bonuses were increased to 400% (up from 200%). Every executive maxxed out his or her bonus.

2015-01-30 07:09:35,"Who actually benefits from Obama's 'Middle Class Economics' - Jan. 30, 2015 ",http://money.cnn.com/2015/01/30/news/economy/obama-middle-class-economics/index.html,"President Obama says he's all about the middle class.
He's labeled his agenda, Middle Class Economics, and released a raft of plans that he says will help these families get ahead. To pay for it, he'd tax the rich.
But not everyone in the middle class would benefit from Middle Class Economics. It's heavily weighted in favor of married couples and parents of young children.
""Many people in the middle class will get no benefit from the president's proposal,"" said Roberton Williams, a fellow at the Tax Policy Center. ""Among the middle class, it's targeted at people with kids and second earners. Virtually no single middle class people without kids will get anything.""
The White House and some liberal policy groups, however, contend that the center's methodology wrongly labels some affluent Americans as middle class.
Related: What you need to know about Obama's proposal for the middle class
It's tough to gauge how the tax plan would actually help the middle class because the averages can be deceiving. Many people on both sides of the aisle pounced on the center's recent analysis that showed middle income people, making between $49,000 and $84,000, would pay an extra $7 in tax, on average.
Drilling down, however, reveals that the center added an average $19 tax bill to everyone in that bracket to account for a tax on banks, which ultimately is borne by all Americans.
A different picture emerges when one looks at just the individual income tax provisions. These include a credit for working couples and expanding the child care tax credit.
That's why taxpayers with children come out the big winners under the president's plan. Nearly 51% of middle class filers with kids would receive a tax cut. These taxpayers would receive a $329 decrease, on average.
Some 45% of married folks who file jointly would get a tax break. This group would see an average cut of $200.
Related: How Obama would close the 'trust fund loophole'
Far fewer middle class single and elderly taxpayers would benefit from Obama's plan.
Only 12.5% of single filers would get a tax cut. Overall, this group would see a $61 increase, because nearly 7% of middle class singles would see their taxes go up and that skews the overall average.
Among the elderly, only 10% would enjoy a dip in their taxes. But because many in this group would be hit with another of the president's provisions -- that would require estates to pay capital gains on appreciated assets -- they would pay an additional $152, on average.
Overall, fewer than one in four middle class taxpayers would benefit from Middle Class Economics, according to the center's analysis.
Still, White House Office of Management and Budget Director Shaun Donovan and some left-leaning groups say the Tax Policy Center overestimates the tax hikes on the middle class.
The center doesn't factor in unrealized capital gains into its income ranking, argues the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. So people with moderate incomes but considerable assets are considered middle class. A very small number of these taxpayers would be hit hard by the proposed capital gains tax on estates, which skews the overall average.
Donovan, speaking on NPR Monday morning, pointed to the Department of Treasury analysis, which shows that between a quarter and one-third of families in the $50,000 to $75,000 income range would see a tax change. Their taxes would be lowered by between $450 and $570, on average.
Treasury's analysis, which counts the unrealized gains as income, shows that 99% of Americans paying the capital gain tax have incomes above $500,000.
Also, the Tax Policy Center's analysis doesn't take into account the proposal to make the American Opportunity Tax Credit permanent because it wouldn't happen until after 2017, says CBPP. This would also help middle class families.
As for the rich, the president's plan does accomplish its goal of raising their taxes. Just over three-quarters of the Top 1% would see a tax hike, of $34,500, on average. And more than nine out of 10 of Top .01% would see a tax increase, of $167,250, on average."
2015-02-01 07:21:24,"Super Bowl advertisers 'are on trial' - Feb. 1, 2015 ",http://money.cnn.com/2015/02/01/media/super-bowl-ad-review/index.html,"Defying a stereotype of beer-soaked, sex-saturated ads, this year's crop of Super Bowl commercials were by turns triumphant and thoughtful, and at times even downright somber.
There were babies, dads, dogs, celebrities, athletes, and more babies. But there was also a minute-long message about domestic violence and a dead child who ""couldn't grow up.""
The provocative messages were meant to stand out from the dozens of other spots competing for attention. They might have made for a few awkward moments at viewing parties, but there were still plenty of ads that elicited smiles.
Well-received spots included Budweiser's ""Lost Dog"" commercial; BMW's humorous ad with Katie Couric and Bryant Gumbel; and a serious Coca Cola ad rebuking Internet ""haters."" Other hits included a throw-back Snickers ad starring Danny Trejo and Steve Buscemi and an almost universally praised Dodge ad featuring senior citizens.

For the companies, Sunday was a $4.5 million moment. Months of planning and weeks of promotion culminated in 15 to 60 seconds in front of more than 100 million viewers -- and those viewers instantly delivered their verdicts via the Internet.
""Advertisers are on trial via social media,"" said media strategist Shari Anne Brill.
Companies facing negative reviews on Sunday night -- but still lots of chatter about their ads -- included Nationwide Insurance, T-Mobile and GoDaddy.
Nationwide's ad showed a boy speaking about the life he would have lived, had he not been killed in an accident.
""I'll never learn how to ride a bike. Or get cooties!"" the character said.
""That Nationwide ad just knocked me off my chair,"" CNNMoney's Frank Pallotta tweeted.
As criticism mounted on Sunday night, Nationwide felt compelled to issue a statement: ""The sole purpose of this message was to start a conversation, not sell insurance.""
The conversation Nationwide wanted to start was about how ""preventable injuries around the home are the leading cause of childhood deaths in America.""
Instead, the boy became a meme even before halftime.
""The second I see a kid in one of these commercials I immediately assume they're going to die. Thanks, Nationwide!"" comedian Patton Oswalt tweeted.

Paying an average of $4.5 million for 30 seconds of air time, advertisers during the four quarters of the Super Bowl faced extraordinarily high stakes. (And that's just the price paid to NBC -- companies pay huge amounts of money to get the ads produced.)
""There were a lot of tear-jerkers during the game, including Budweiser's puppy ad, Microsoft (boy with prosthetics) and Nationwide (childhood deaths),"" said Sean Muller, the CEO of iSpot.tv, which tracked online reaction to the ads.
""This had a lot of people begging for more funny ads, which seemed to be more absent this year -- though FiatUSA, Doritos, Skittles and Avocados of Mexico (yes, avocados!) were hits among funny ads.""
One ad right before kickoff that drew immediate commentary: a spot by Chevrolet about the wireless Internet capabilities of its Colorado trucks. ""Chevy trucks advertising 4G LTE instead of driving through gratuitous mud. The world has truly gone tech,"" Mashable chief strategy officer Adam Ostrow wrote on Twitter.
There were also two commercials for mobile games, and for the first time, Snapchat showed up in an ad.
The all-important first ad position after kick-off belonged to Toyota, (TM) which had a feel-good spot starring Paralympic athlete Amy Purdy.
Some advertisers tried to capitalize on their multi-million-dollar investment by releasing their ads days ahead of time -- prompting speculation that this reduced game day anticipation.
Muller said ""the volume of pre-releases/teasers"" was definitely different this year.
Some advertisers, he said, used Facebook's relatively new video features to get attention, ""driving up viewing and social activity significantly.""
But ""the volume of views and activity on Facebook appears to be an additive, meaning it's not taking away from activity on other platforms,"" like YouTube, Muller said. ""And secondly, some brands aren't utilizing it yet -- I suspect that will change next year.""
A high number of ads had social messages, including Procter & Gamble's ""Like A Girl"" ad that challenged gender norms, and Coca Cola's ad encouraging happy Internet communications.
""We can't solve negativity on the Internet, but we can use the world's biggest advertising stage to ask people to think twice before posting negative messages and images,"" Jennifer Healan, the company's group director of integrated marketing content, said in a statement. ""We hoped to inspire Americans to help make the Internet a more inclusive, happier place.""
Perhaps the most thought-provoking ad of the game was the one commissioned by the NFL for its ""No More"" initiative, intended to stop domestic violence and sexual assault.
""The spot, which features a woman calling 911 and pretending to order a pizza because her husband is in the room, is based on a real 911 call,"" said the ad blog Spot Bowl, which called it a ""game-changer.""
It said the NFL was giving over ""some of the airtime it normally reserves for light-hearted self promos"" for the PSA.
Brill, a former executive at the ad agency Carat, noted that the NFL says it is contributing $5 million per year for the next five years to the National Domestic Violence hotline.
""It's about time,"" she said."

""Compared to 15 years ago we're big, compared to 15 years [from now], we're still a baby,"" Ma said at the World Economic Forum, setting out his vision to turn the Chinese e-commerce group into a global platform for small business.
The last time Ma came to Davos was in 2008, when the world was gripped by the financial crisis.
China's richest man has spent those seven years making one of the most influential Internet retail companies in the world, or in his words, giving ""something in return."" Alibaba (BABA, Tech30) is now worth nearly $260 billion, more than Facebook (FB, Tech30) and way more than IBM (IBM, Tech30).
Some of Alibaba's metrics are already hard to fathom. Ma told the Davos audience that Alibaba has already created 14 million jobs in China, directly and indirectly.
It connects small businesses with consumers, attracting 100 million buyers a day. About 60 million transactions are processed each day.
But expect those numbers to be dwarfed when Ma puts to use the $25 billion raised in Alibaba's record IPO last year.
Alibaba is a growing force in Asia, Brazil and Russia, where it's already one of the top three e-commerce entities. It's also helping farmers in Washington state and fishermen in Alaska sell cherries and seafood to China.

In the future, the company should be able to help a small business in Norway sell its products to Argentina, and help Argentinians buy things online from Switzerland, Ma said.
""Today, the Internet can help small business sell things across the oceans. I hope we can serve 2 billion consumers and help 10 million small businesses outside China,"" he said.
He also mused about China's economic slowdown.
Slower growth in the world's second biggest economy was inevitable, Ma said.
""It's impossible to keep 9% growth. You would never see the blue sky, you would never see quality,"" he said. ""China should pay attention to the quality of the economy ... China is moving in that direction."""

Separately, bowing to pressure from consumer advocates and fellow Democrats, the administration is extending Obamacare enrollment for those who learn they owe a penalty for being uninsured in 2014.
Incorrect subsidy tax forms: Enrollees who received incorrect forms will have to hold off on filing their taxes. About 20% of those who qualified for subsidies to lower their 2014 premiums received the inaccurate form.
Some were mistakenly told they received too large a subsidy in 2014, while others were told their subsidy was too small. The form incorrectly listed the premium of the benchmark plan in their area, which is used in conjunction with the taxpayer's income to calculate the subsidy amount.
Taxpayers use this form when filing their return to determine whether they have to pay back part of their subsidy or whether they get a larger one. The Department of Health and Human Services, which runs healthcare.gov, is notifying those affected. They should receive the updated forms in early March.
Related: I have to pay back my Obamacare subsidy
Some 50,000 people in this group already filed their taxes. They will work with the Internal Revenue Service to reconcile the matter, administration officials said.
About 100,000 California residents who enrolled in their state-based exchange also have to contend with inaccurate tax forms. They were notified in early February and should receive updated forms in coming weeks.
Some 6.7 million people enrolled in Obamacare coverage in 2014, roughly 85% of whom received subsidies. Sign-ups climbed to 11.4 million for 2015, though it remains to be seen how many will complete their enrollment by paying their premiums.
Enrollment extension for those who owe the penalty: The special enrollment period, which runs from March 15 to April 30, is open to those who are uninsured now and who learned they owe the penalty after open enrollment ended on Feb. 15. It applies to those in the 37 states using the federal exchange, though Washington, Minnesota and Vermont have already extended enrollment for penalty payers. California also announced Friday that those who owe a penalty can enroll from Feb. 23 through April 30. New York also extended its enrollment period for this group.
Some 44% likely to be penalized for not having coverage had heard nothing or only a little about the fee, according to a new survey from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Urban Institute. Up to 6 million people are expected to owe the penalty, Treasury officials have said.
Calculator: Do you owe the penalty?
Many of the uninsured are learning they owe the penalty for 2014 when they file their taxes. This is prompting some to want to enroll for this year, when the penalty is even larger. But enrollment closed on Sunday, so those doing their taxes after that date are out of luck. Consumer organizations and Senate Democrats have been pressing the administration to extend the deadline to allow these folks to obtain insurance for this year.
The penalty for 2014 equals $95 or 1% of income, whichever is greater. But those who remain uninsured this year have to pay the greater of $325, or 2% of income.
A family of four earning $70,000 a year will pay nearly $500 for being uninsured in 2014. That penalty will double to nearly $1,000 this year.

Some people, particularly low-income Americans, can qualify for exemptions.
Administration officials said this extension for penalty payers will not be repeated next year. Enrollment for 2016 will run from Nov. 1 through Jan. 31.

This fairy-tale scenario is set to become a reality for about 60,000 low-income Croatians who have been struggling to pay their bills.
The Croatian government, acting in place of a fairy godmother, has launched a program called ""Fresh Start"" that will cancel the debt owed by some of the poorest people in the country.
The state, alongside a number of banks, telecom operators, electricity companies, local governments and other firms, have collectively agreed to forgive debt worth up to 60,000 Croatian kuna ($8,830) per individual.
Croatia's economy is in the midst of a prolonged recession, with gross domestic product declining every quarter since the end of 2011.
This measure is expected to boost consumer confidence and spending.

The program is designed specifically for households that made less than 2,500 kuna ($370) over the last three months and meet other financial criteria.
""This is for the bottom layer of debtors where there is clearly no chance that they will ever repay the debts that they have,"" said Otilia Dhand, a political analyst at Teneo Intelligence.
The government noted that it has never had a debt forgiveness program of this magnitude, but said this is a one-off initiative.
Dhand says the move was not a surprise since the government has recently lost support in the polls. She said this will give the government a popularity boost ahead of parliamentary elections, which are expected by the end of February 2016.
The International Monetary Fund has recommended a laundry list of reforms and overhauls to get the Croatian economy back on track. In November, it said it supported the idea of writing off debt for distressed households."

The action, confirmed by state media, has affected VPN providers including Astrill, Strong VPN and Golden Frog, which have all reported trouble with connectivity in China, particularly on mobile devices.
China has long blocked access to what it deems as sensitive Internet content -- political commentary, foreign news outlets and sites like Google. Access to Twitter, Facebook and YouTube are also blocked in China.
Taken together, the restrictions constitute the world's largest -- and most effective -- state-sponsored censorship program. The effort, officially called ""Golden Shield,"" is more than a decade old.
Using a VPN allows Chinese and foreigners alike to circumvent the Great Firewall. For around $10 a month, users are able to access blocked websites, Gmail and even Netflix.
Chinese state media described the crackdown as a ""healthy development"" for the Internet, and one needed to shore up cybersecurity. It follows a move to tighten access to Google's email service that began late last year.
Should the VPN blackout persist -- or expand -- it would be a real headache for companies that rely on the workaround to conduct business.
Related: The Great Firewall of China is nearly complete
Winger Chen, who owns a food and beverage consulting company in China, has always ""felt some frustration with [spotty connectivity],"" but considers it to be ""just part of doing business in China.""
Chen said he is ""100% reliant"" on various Google services that allow colleagues to sync data across the company.
""What happens if we have zero access to Google, and they cut off our VPN?"" he asked.
Larger firms with proprietary VPNs are better protected. But more foreign companies are reporting that Chinese Internet restrictions are making it difficult to do business on the mainland.
In 2014, 56% of American companies operating in China said that Internet censorship was having a negative or somewhat negative impact on their ability to conduct business, according to a survey conducted by the American Chamber of Commerce in China.
That's up sharply from 2010, when only 39% of companies said censorship was problematic.
For now, the VPN companies say they're looking into the problem. Golden Frog has confirmed the problem ""is not being caused by server issues,"" according to a company statement.
""It is rather a network issue specific to China that is not only impacting [our VPN service], but other VPN services as well.""

Ulbricht faced a series of charges, ranging from money laundering to drug trafficking to computer hacking.
Launched in 2011, Silk Road was an unregulated online marketplace where users could buy and sell anything from drugs to hacking tutorials. Payments were made using bitcoin, a digital currency that's difficult to trace, and the site used software that let users browse anonymously.
Related: Alleged Silk Road kingpin gets his day in court
Over the past weeks, prosecutors said Ulbricht was the mastermind behind the site. According to the feds, he went by the name Dread Pirate Roberts, a reference to a character in the movie The Princess Bride. They said they traced around $13 million in bitcoin to Ulbricht's computer. The defense argued that Ulbricht had created the site but passed it on to another operator but was lured back in as a fall guy.
In an exclusive interview before the verdict, Ulbricht's parents maintained their son's innocence.
""I think in 30 years, there would have been a glimmer among either of us,"" his mother, Lyn, said. ""This drug kingpin thing ...The guy was living in a very simple apartment, living a very simple life. So many things don't add up.""
The prosecution had a strong case against Ulbricht. During the trial, they presented chat logs, journal entries detailing operations, and the testimony of a college friend who said he helped Ulbricht create the site.
""Ulbricht's arrest and conviction -- and our seizure of millions of dollars of Silk Road bitcoins -- should send a clear message to anyone else attempting to operate an online criminal enterprise,"" read a statement from U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara.

Pascal will launch a new production venture at the studio starting in May.
""I have spent almost my entire professional life at Sony Pictures and I am energized to be starting this new chapter based at the company I call home,"" Pascal said in a statement. ""I am leaving the studio in great hands.""
Putting a positive spin on her move, neither Pascal nor any other Sony (SNE) executives alluded to the fallout from the cyber-attack in Thursday's announcement. But there had been widespread speculation that Pascal would lose her job as a result of the fallout.
Pascal's contract was said to be coming due before the late November cyber-attack. Through the hack, embarrassing emails from the company's servers were leaked onto the Internet, causing public humiliation and private recriminations for Pascal and others.

Some of Pascal's stolen emails were highly critical of stars like Angelina Jolie. Others were racially-tinged, including jokes at President Obama's expense; those emails led to a public apology from Pascal and a meeting with Al Sharpton.
""The content of my emails were insensitive and inappropriate but are not an accurate reflection of who I am,"" she said in a statement at the time. ""Although this was a private communication that was stolen, I accept full responsibility for what I wrote and apologize to everyone who was offended.""
Pascal has been one of the most powerful female studio executives in the film business. She helped turn Sony Pictures into a major brand in Hollywood.
Sony said in a news release that under her leadership, the studio ""has amassed over $46 billion in global theatrical box office, 315 academy award nominations, 212 golden globe nominations and 115 number one openings.""
""The studio's legacy is due in large part to Amy's passion for storytelling and love of this industry,"" said Michael Lynton, the CEO of Sony Entertainment.
He called Pascal ""a great partner to me in heading the studio"" and said he would continue to have a ""close working relationship with her in her new role on the lot.""
Pascal's new production company will have a four-year financing deal with Sony Pictures.

Ito will be succeeded by Takahiro Hachigo, currently Honda's managing officer, the company said in a statement.
Honda (HMC) didn't say whether Ito's resignation had anything to do with the company's recent struggles -- a massive recall over faulty airbags, poor sales, and regulatory fines.
But the surprise announcement comes after Honda recalled millions of vehicles due to faulty airbags produced by another Japanese company, Takata. Other auto manufacturers, including Toyota (TM), have also had to recall vehicles due to the airbags.
Honda issued a profit warning in January, lowering its own annual net profit forecast by 5%. It was also hit last month with a $70 million fine for failing to report all the accident information required under U.S. regulatory rules.
""Going forward, changes will be coming up more and more rapidly, competition will be more severe, so I think now is a good time to change the management to a younger generation so as to revamp our whole operations,"" Ito said at a news conference.
Outgoing CEO Ito joined Honda in 1978, and climbed the ranks to become head of the company in June 2009. He oversaw changes to Honda's manufacturing structure around the globe, establishing new plants in developing countries such as Brazil, Indonesia and China.
Hachigo is a longtime Honda employee, first joining in 1982, as an engineer. Over the years, he has overseen Honda operations in the U.S., Europe and China.
The management changes are still subject to shareholder approval, but are expected to be effective in June after the company's annual shareholder meeting.
Honda announced Ito's resignation after markets closed in Tokyo on Monday. Shares fell in 0.6% in New York on Monday, and dropped as much as 1.8% in Tokyo trading Tuesday morning.

China Minsheng Bank released a statement on Saturday saying its president, Mao Xiaofeng, had resigned for ""personal reasons."" While the statement sought to reassure shareholders that the firm was operating normally, Chinese business publication Caixin said that other bank executives had also been questioned and released.
According to Caixin, Mao was detained last week for questioning by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, which investigates corruption within the Communist Party.
Minsheng has a market cap of about $40 billion, making it roughly the same size as Deutsche Bank. Shares tumbled as much as 10.5% on Monday in Hong Kong trading before mounting a partial recovery.
The Chinese government has staged a wide-reaching anti-corruption crackdown since President Xi Jinping took the reins nearly two years ago. The probes have netted top party and government officials, as well as executives at state-run and private companies. One of the most high-profile officials to be detained thus far is Ling Jihua, a top aide to former president Hu Jintao.

Mao joined Minsheng in 2002, and served in a variety of roles at the bank over the years, according to previous stock exchange filings. Prior to that, he served as a director in the China Communist Youth League, a group directly under Communist Party control. He holds a master's degree from Harvard University, as well as graduate diplomas from Hunan University.

The NYSE said RadioShack does not have a high enough market value to be listed on the exchange - the minimum required is $50 million.
The NYSE said RadioShack ""does not intend to submit a business plan"" to the exchange to address how it could raise its market value.
Shares of RadioShack (RSH) had lost 90% of their value in the last 12 months.
The retailer has been low on cash. Struggling to compete with online stores like Amazon, losses mounted and RadioShack burned through all but $43 million of its cash by last November. Even counting its credit lines, the company only had $63 million available heading into the Christmas shopping season.

Although it once boasted about its vast retail network, saying that 90% of the U.S. population lived or worked within a few minutes of a RadioShack location, the company's 5,000 stores have been weighing it down.
Last March, the company announced a plan to close about 1,100 stores, but it's an expensive undertaking due to the cost of severance, liquidating merchandise and paying penalties to get out of leases.
It was only able to close 175 stores through the end of October. By year's end it was battling with its lenders including Salus to get the green light to close more.
RadioShack declined to comment on the delisting or the default notice.

Kaspersky said Sunday it has uncovered how hackers surreptitiously installed spying software on bank computers, eventually learned how to mimic bank employee workflows and used the knowledge to make transfers into bank accounts they had created for this theft.
More than 100 banks were hit, Kaspersky said, and based on the hackers' practice of stealing between $2.5 million and $10 million from each bank, it estimated ""total financial losses could be as a high as $1 billion, making this by far the most successful criminal cyber campaign we have ever seen.""
Kaspersky did not name the banks but said they are institutions located in 25 countries, including the United States.
It also said the ""attacks remain active,"" and provided tips for bank officials to determine if their computers are vulnerable.
The thieves were Russian, Ukrainian, Chinese and European, Kaspersky said.
The individual thefts involved no more than $10 million apiece.

Kaspersky called the malware ""Carbanak"" and said it provided the hackers the ability to watch bank employees conduct their business.
""This allowed them to see and record everything that happened on the screens of staff who serviced the cash transfer systems,"" Kaspersky said. ""In this way the fraudsters got to know every last detail of the bank clerks' work and were able to mimic staff activity in order to transfer money and cash out.""
After penetrating a bank's computer systems, the hackers lurked for ""two to four months"" before striking in one of several ways, like changing an account balance, then transferring the excess funds into their own accounts. They also spewed cash out of ATMs when ""one of the gang's henchmen was waiting beside the machine"" to collect the money.
An industry cybersecurity group has ""disseminated intelligence on this attack to the members,"" according to The New York Times, which first covered the report. The Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center told the Times that ""some briefings were also provided by law enforcement entities.""

NBC News president Deborah Turness informed staffers of the network's decision at a meeting shortly after Williams' fill-in, Lester Holt, finished anchoring the ""NBC Nightly News.""
Here is her full written statement released by NBC:
All,
We have decided today to suspend Brian Williams as Managing Editor and Anchor of NBC Nightly News for six months. The suspension will be without pay and is effective immediately. We let Brian know of our decision earlier today. Lester Holt will continue to substitute Anchor the NBC Nightly News.
Our review, which is being led by Richard Esposito working closely with NBCUniversal General Counsel Kim Harris, is ongoing, but I think it is important to take you through our thought process in coming to this decision.
While on Nightly News on Friday, January 30, 2015, Brian misrepresented events which occurred while he was covering the Iraq War in 2003. It then became clear that on other occasions Brian had done the same while telling that story in other venues. This was wrong and completely inappropriate for someone in Brian's position.
Related: How Brian Williams' Iraq story changed
In addition, we have concerns about comments that occurred outside NBC News while Brian was talking about his experiences in the field.
As Managing Editor and Anchor of Nightly News, Brian has a responsibility to be truthful and to uphold the high standards of the news division at all times.
Steve Burke, Pat Fili and I came to this decision together. We felt it would have been wrong to disregard the good work Brian has done and the special relationship he has forged with our viewers over 22 years. Millions of Americans have turned to him every day, and he has been an important and well-respected part of our organization.
As I'm sure you understand, this was a very hard decision. Certainly there will be those who disagree. But we believe this suspension is the appropriate and proportionate action.
This has been a difficult time. But NBC News is bigger than this moment. You work so hard and dedicate yourselves each and every day to the important work of bringing trusted, credible news to our audience. Because of you, your loyalty, your dedication, NBC News is an organization we can -- and should -- all be proud of. We will get through this together.
Steve Burke asked me to share the following message:
""This has been a painful period for all concerned and we appreciate your patience while we gathered the available facts. By his actions, Brian has jeopardized the trust millions of Americans place in NBC News. His actions are inexcusable and this suspension is severe and appropriate. Brian's life's work is delivering the news. I know Brian loves his country, NBC News and his colleagues. He deserves a second chance and we are rooting for him. Brian has shared his deep remorse with me and he is committed to winning back everyone's trust.""

CheapAir.com analyzed nearly 5 million trips last year and found the best prices for domestic airfare were booked, on average, 47 days ahead of the departure date. The year before, the sweet spot was 54 days.
The online airfare shopping engine tracked prices from 320 days in advance up until the day before a flight and found the prime booking window was generally one to four months ahead of departure. The lowest price of a ticket changed around 70 times when it was for sale, the report found.
By booking on the cheapest day, fliers saved an average of $201 on airfare, excluding the 14 days before a flight since fares are much higher then. If those two weeks are included, the difference rises to $319.
Of course, there are no guarantees. Many factors can affect ticket prices, including time of year, the destination and local events.
""As much as everyone wants an answer for an exact number so they don't have to worry about finding the best price, it's not that simple,"" said Jeff Klee, CEO of CheapAir.com.
Related: Fly business class to London for 50% less
While booking the lowest price isn't an exact science, one thing is clear: procrastination doesn't pay. Buying tickets within 14 days of departure resulted in paying $111 more on average and $174 more when bought seven days in advance.
However, booking too early can also mean paying more. When a ticket is first offered, it's priced about $50 above its lowest point, according to the report. As time goes on, carriers start offering periodic short-term sales to fill seats.
""The odds of you paying the exact same price as the person sitting next to you is really small,"" Klee said.
Airline consolidation has impacted prices, he added. When one carrier offers a sale, the others are likely to follow suit to remain competitive. Less players in the game means less options for consumers. ""It used to be a buyer's market.""

The day you fly can also bring savings. Tuesday and Wednesday are the least expensive days to fly, said Klee, while Sunday and Friday were the most expensive.
He also recommended searching flights early and often and be ready to pull the trigger. ""Prices change really frequently, people make the mistake of going home and talking to their family to figure out plans and come back the next day and it's gone."""
2015-02-05 12:27:56,"Controversy grows over Brian Williams' Iraq apology - Feb. 5, 2015 ",http://money.cnn.com/2015/02/05/media/brian-williams-iraq/index.html,"Update: The pilot interviewed in this story, Rich Krell, is no longer standing by his account. In a text to CNNMoney Friday morning, Krell wrote: ""The information I gave you was true based on my memories, but at this point I am questioning my memories."" (full story)
If NBC and Brian Williams believed a Facebook post and an on-air apology were enough, they were wrong.
In the hours after Williams recanted a long-told story about an RPG attack in Iraq, rank and file employees at NBC News openly wondered whether he would be sanctioned -- or worse -- for the series of errors.
Some of the employees said they doubted that Williams made an innocent mistake and said he'd damaged the network's credibility as well as his own.
But most employees predicted that Williams' job was safe, and some cautioned against an overreaction to the misstatements. No disciplinary action against the anchor is expected.
The executives in charge of the news division have declined to comment, perhaps out of a reluctance to advance the story. And following his apology on Wednesday, Williams said nothing more about it on his Thursday night newscast.
Meanwhile, new details emerged about what exactly happened back in 2003 -- further clouding an already confusing tale. Here's what we know:
Williams says he made an innocent mistake: Brian Williams has been NBC's top news anchor for the past decade. Several times in recent years, he has said that he was aboard a U.S. Army helicopter when it was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade on one of the first days of the Iraq War in 2003.
He was actually aboard a different helicopter.
Last Friday, while honoring a veteran on ""NBC Nightly News,"" Williams recounted how his helicopter was ""forced down after being hit by an RPG.""
He apologized on Wednesday's ""NBC Nightly News"" for that specific error -- ""I made a mistake,"" he said -- but he did not address his broader series of misstatements in the past.

Williams' apology came after soldiers challenged his account on Facebook and the military newspaper Stars and Stripes began investigating. Stars and Stripes interviewed several crew members on the 159th Aviation Regiment's helicopter that actually was struck by the RPG, and they said ""the NBC anchor was nowhere near that aircraft or two other Chinooks flying in the formation that took fire.""
Stars and Stripes reported Wednesday that ""Williams arrived in the area about an hour later on another helicopter after the other three had made an emergency landing, the crew members said.""
Related: How Brian Williams' Iraq story changed
Helicopter pilot tells CNN Williams 'messed up': Rich Krell, who was piloting the Chinook that Williams was on, tells a different story than the crew members who spoke to Stars and Stripes.
""Some of things he's said are not true. But some of the things they're saying against him are not true either,"" said Krell, who spoke exclusively to CNN on Thursday morning.
UPDATE: Krell is no longer standing by this account. On Friday morning he told CNN: ""I am questioning my memories."" (full story)
Krell explained that, contrary to Williams' comments in the past, there were three helicopters flying in close formation, not four.
""One of the birds broke down, so we were a flight of three,"" Krell said. ""We were hauling metal bridges.""
Williams was in the back of Krell's aircraft along with three other NBC staffers. Krell referred to his Chinook as the ""second bird"" in the formation. The ""first bird,"" right in front of the ""second bird,"" was struck by the RPG.
Due to his seat in the back, Williams was most likely unable to witness the RPG attack, Krell said.
All three of the helicopters were hit by small arms fire, Krell said, supporting Williams' past claims about that.
""The bridge expansions we were hauling took most of the hits,"" Krell said.
The three Chinooks took evasive maneuvers. Krell's helicopter dropped off its payload, then met up with the other two about 45 minutes later. That may explain why the other crew members told Stars and Stripes that Williams arrived in the area later.
Krell said of Williams, ""Yeah, he messed up some things and said some things he shouldn't have. IÂ [first] heard it a few years ago. ... Actually one of my flight engineers said, 'Did you hear him say that? Wasn't he on our bird?'""
Krell didn't seem overly bothered by Williams' revisionist history -- he chalked it up to wartime theatrics. ""After a while, with combat stories, you just go 'Whatever,'"" he said.
Anger inside NBC about the 'fish tale': Others have called the RPG attack story ""a fish tale,"" one that grew and grew over the years, to the point where Williams felt comfortable saying that he'd been aboard the Chinook that was struck by the RPG.
An NBC News spokeswoman said Thursday that the network stood by Williams' apology and had nothing further to say.
Williams is the face of NBC News and is beloved by many viewers. Last December he signed a new contract that extends almost through the end of the decade.
At the time, Williams said that it was akin to ""reaffirming your vows.""
Williams has many fans within the news division, but they were mostly silent on Thursday. Others within the news division, granted anonymity to speak freely about the situation, said there was widespread shock and disbelief about Williams' foggy-memory explanation. One correspondent called it ""unreal.""
Correspondents and producers with war zone experience seemed particularly perturbed.
""I don't know how you manage to begin to clean up from this, or if you even can,"" said one longtime employee. ""He's in for a hell of a ride.""
For much of the day, the hashtag #BrianWilliamsRemembers was trending on Twitter across the United States. Williams found himself the punchline of jokes.
Yet NBC executives seemed to conclude that they could stomach the criticism and continue to support Williams."

As its economy slides into recession and business opportunities in Europe and the U.S. dry up due to sanctions, Moscow has turned to Pyongyang.
The Russian Chamber of Commerce set up a special Council for Cooperation with North Korea this week. The goal is to increase trade between the two to $1 billion a year -- double the current level -- by 2020.
As part of the agreement, Moscow will allow North Korean firms to set up accounts in Russian banks. In exchange, it will gain access to North Korea's mineral mines. The two countries agreed to trade exclusively in rubles.
Pyongyang also promised to ease up its visa process for Russian businessmen, who might be allowed to use the Internet and mobile phones while on business trips to the secretive state -- a luxury residents and other visitors can only dream of.
In another goodwill gesture towards Pyongyang, Russia canceled $10 billion of North Korea's $11 billion Soviet era debt in mid-2014.
To show the world just how chummy the two sides have become, Kim Jong Un is reportedly considering a trip to Russia to attend ceremonies marking the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II.
Related: Why North Korea's economy can't live without China
Russian business ties with the West have been unraveling since the U.S., Europe and other partners imposed sanctions on Moscow for annexing Crimea and supporting pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine.
To make up for the lack of opportunities with the West, Moscow has been getting cozy with Asia. Russia signed a multi-billion dollar gas deal with China last year and trade between the two is posed to increase 10% this year.
The courtship with North Korea could also give a boost to Russia's plan of extending the trans-Siberian railroad into South Korea.

2015-02-16 09:51:46,"Wanted at police departments: Guns that don't kill - Feb. 16, 2015 ",http://money.cnn.com/2015/02/16/technology/less-lethal-weapons/index.html,"The Police Force Triple Defender is an outlandish new weapon that's designed specifically not to kill you.
Instead, this brand new sci-fi type weapon incapacitates you in three different ways: it can blind you with pepper gas, zap you with a stun gun and then disorient you with a strobe light.
Welcome to the world of non-lethal weapons ... or less-lethal, to use police parlance, because there's no guarantee that they won't kill you.
After all, a common less-lethal weapon that cops use -- the Taser -- has killed people, though the extent of the death toll is disputed. Amnesty International says that more than 500 people have died in the U.S. ""after being shocked with a Taser either during their arrest or while in jail."" But Taser, the company, says the tally of deaths directly attributed to Taser is more like 60.
Police departments around the nation are under tremendous pressure to find weapons that don't take lives (like the Triple Defender, pictured below). That's because there's been intense scrutiny of incidents where police violence has led to deaths of unarmed people.
Concerns have especially mounted after last year's violence and riots in Ferguson, Missouri, following a white cop killing an unarmed black teenager.
The same introspection has led Ferguson police department to currently explore a device that will diminish the force of a bullet.
Called the Alternative, the device is basically a small metal ball that is clipped on the end of a gun. When the gun is discharged, the bullet embeds itself into the ball as it hurtles towards the target and helps lessen the bullet's impact.
The person probably won't get killed from the gun (pictured below). But it would still hurt like hell.
""It's going to feel like you're getting punched in the chest by Barry Bonds,"" said Christian Ellis, founder and CEO of Alternative Ballistics, the company that makes the device. ""It's going to break some ribs.""
Another company, called Security Devices International, offers a variety of less-lethal ammunition than can be fired from 40 mm grenade launchers. This includes projectiles containing pepper gas, or colored liquid to identify suspects. There's also a ""malodorant round"" which contains ""a highly noxious payload that delivers an appalling odor"" that can help disperse a crowd.
Related: Ferguson police exploring 'less lethal' weapon option
Ferguson police have also recently been adopting body cameras. The cameras are made by Taser International (TASR). But Tasers themselves have come under scrutiny.
A Taser fires electricity into people and shocks them. On its web site, Taser says its electric pulses ""affect the sensory and motor functions of the peripheral nervous system and cause incapacitation."" The company claims that weapons do not damage vital organs, have ""been safely deployed more than 3.5 million times"" and saved 125,000 people from death or injury.
But Amnesty says Tasers unnecessarily kill people.
""We recognize that there is a need for less lethal tools to minimize the risk of death and injury, which is inherent in police use of firearms,"" said Amnesty researcher Justin Mazzola. ""But what we're always calling for is that Tasers be used as a last resort. Right now there are no national guidelines.""
Taser spokesman Steve Tuttle said that Amnesty International makes Taser look worse than it is by blaming the weapons for hundreds of deaths that were actually caused by drug intoxication.

Even the U.S. military is looking into a futuristic weapon for controlling crowds. Developed by Raytheon (RTN), it basically functions like a giant microwave.
It repels crowds by blasting them with invisible heat rays. Raytheon describes its so-called Active Denial System as a weapon that ""emits a focused beam of millimeter wave energy that penetrates the skin to 1/64th of an inch, producing an intolerable heating sensation that causes targeted individuals to flee.""
Kelley Hughes, a civilian employee working with the military weapon, volunteered to get zapped by it on five occasions. She compared it to the sudden heat from an open oven door, even though she was 3,000 feet from the source of the beam.
""I felt an intolerable heating sensation,"" she said. ""I felt its heat ramping up quickly and lasting a few brief seconds on my entire body. My immediate reflex was to move quickly away from the beam.""
The Air Force says the Active Denial System is not a microwave, even if it sounds like one. The Air Force also says it's not radioactive, does not cause cancer or infertility, and can only be lethal if the energy beam is ""sustained and prolonged many times.""
The Air Force deployed the weapon to Afghanistan in 2010. But aside from testing, it has not been used on humans.
While using such weapons in place of guns might help to reduce casualties, they are also not that widely tested to see what kind of long lasting consequences can result. Also, in many cases, these weapons do end up killing their targets.
They're no substitute for good community policing, according to Sam Bieler, a criminologist and researcher with the Justice Policy Center of the Urban Institute.
""We should really be thinking about what training we can give our police that ... makes them less reliant on force to deescalate tense incidents,"" he said.

Here are seven amazing statistics about the fastest growing city in the West:
1. Talent influx: As the financial capital of Europe, London attracts thousands of high-skilled migrants every year. It was named the talent capital of the world in 2013 by Deloitte.
2. Booming economy: Robust growth in the technology and creative industries, a recovery in financial services, and booming housing market are powering London forward. Its economy was recently crowned the fastest growing in the western world.
3. Big money: London has more billionaires than any other city in the world -- 72. It beats Moscow with 48 billionaires, while New York has 43.
4. Pricey homes: The influx of rich has left its mark on London's property market, which is now worth as much as Brazil's annual economic output.
5. Moving around: More Londoners means more pressure on transport. 24 million journeys are made every day across the capital, many in overcrowded subways.

2015-02-24 07:01:59,"8 tax audit red flags - Feb. 24, 2015 ",http://money.cnn.com/2015/02/24/pf/taxes/tax-audit-red-flags/index.html,"Budget cuts at the IRS may mean fewer audits this year. But that doesn't mean everyone will get away scot-free.
While chances are low that your return will be targeted by the IRS, why put yourself at risk at all?
Here are 8 relatively easy ways to steer clear of an audit:
1. Report all of your income. Wages from most jobs are reported on W-2 forms, while any interest, dividends and capital gains you made are reported on 1099s, as is income earned by independent contractors or freelancers.
Those forms are sent to both you and the IRS. So be sure to include all information from them on your federal tax return.
Here's why: The agency uses an automated form-matching program to flag discrepancies between what you report and what the IRS has on file, according to the National Association of Enrolled Agents, who are tax preparers authorized to represent clients in an audit.
Any discrepancies will trigger a correspondence audit. Basically, the IRS will send you a letter telling you how much more you owe based on the income you failed to report.
It's up to you whether to just pay the bill or challenge it if you think the IRS didn't calculate it correctly.
2. Run a small business? Prove it. Very few people make a profit when they first start their own business. The IRS understands this... up to a point.
Report losses for three or more years and the agency will start to suspect your business is more of a hobby than a venture aimed at turning a profit, said former IRS tax attorney Garrett Gregory of Addison, Texas.
Such ""hobby loss"" cases may trigger a field audit, which is in-person and more onerous than a correspondence audit.
Related: Filing a false tax return comes with big penalties
To prove you have a real business, be sure to keep records of your business expenses and document how much time you spend on the business and what you do with it.
You want to prove that you ""breathed it, ate it, slept it, drank it,"" Gregory said.
3. If anything seems weird, explain it. The IRS has its tentacles up for unreported income, so explaining anything that looks questionable may dissuade the agency from pursuing an audit.
For example, if your net income is too low to live on given such factors as where you live and your family size, include a disclosure statement detailing how you supported yourself, including any savings, loans or credit cards that you used to pay the bills, the NAEA recommends.
4. Watch the home office deductions. Typically your office is in one place -- either in a rental space or in your home. So don't report a deduction for both. (If you legitimately have offices in both places, explain why in a disclosure statement.)
If your rental expense is for a business storage unit or equipment, the NAEA recommends labeling that cost as a ""storage rental"" or ""equipment rental.""
5. Report the sale of mutual funds: If you sold a mutual fund that you bought before 2011 outside of a tax-advantaged retirement account and you reinvested the money in another mutual fund, you must report it on your federal return, said enrolled agent Stephen DeFilippis of Wheaton, Ill.
If you don't, the IRS will assume the total proceeds from the sale are all taxable gains. And it will send you a letter that recomputes your tax bill accordingly.
In that case, you'd need to go back and prove to the IRS that only a portion of the proceeds represent your capital gains and the rest was your cost basis (i.e.; the amount you originally invested in the fund). Or, if you sold the fund at a loss, that you don't owe any tax on the sale.
6. Come clean about any money overseas: U.S. taxpayers who have bank or investment accounts abroad must report any income they earned on those accounts to the IRS.
While that's always been the case, under the relatively new Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) your foreign financial institution may soon start to report that information to the IRS like any other bank or brokerage would in the United States.
If you've had the account for years, never reported it, and the IRS finds out about it from your foreign bank or investment firm, you could owe some serious penalties in addition to back taxes if the account has generated taxable income, Gregory noted.
Related: IRS will do fewer tax audits this year
To pre-empt such expensive surprises, the IRS has sponsored an offshore voluntary disclosure program that lets people come clean on their own volition and by doing so, reduce any penalties they may owe.
7. Report the sale of your home: When you sell your home, the title company will send you and the IRS a 1099-S form, recording the proceeds from the sale.
Even if all your capital gains on the sale are tax-exempt (because they didn't exceed $250,000 if you're single or $500,000 if you're married), DeFilippis recommends you report information from that 1099-S on your return anyway.
His reason: the 1099-S is part of the IRS form-matching program. Not reporting it may generate a correspondence audit.
8. Be smart about mortgage interest: When you own a home with your spouse, your lender will send you and the IRS a Form 1098, which records how much mortgage interest you paid during the year.
But sometimes the form only includes the name and Social Security number of one spouse, DeFilipis said. Should that person die, and the surviving partner tries to claim the mortgage interest deduction, that may trigger a correspondence audit.
So have the lender change the name and Social Security number on the 1098 before filing. Or, if there's not time for that before April 15, file for an extension and submit your return when you have an amended 1098 in hand."

Justices will hear arguments Wednesday on whether most Obamacare enrollees can keep their subsidies.
A ruling against the Obama administration could send Obamacare into a death spiral.
It's likely that millions of enrollees would drop coverage after losing their assistance, experts said. Insurers would stop offering coverage or be forced to hike rates - by more than 250% by one estimate. Many remaining customers could leave the market after their premiums soar.
""The market would likely melt down very quickly,"" said Larry Levitt, senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation. ""The individual insurance market would be unable to function.""

Related: Obamacare at the Supreme Court: Justices divided over landmark health law
Here's the case in a nutshell: The Affordable Care Act called for the establishment of exchanges through which Americans can purchase health insurance. Those who earn less than four times the poverty level can qualify for subsidies to help pay their monthly premiums.
Only 16 states and the District of Columbia created their own exchanges, leaving the federal government to handle enrollment in the other 34.
The case, King v. Burwell, revolves around whether enrollees in these 34 states can receive federal subsidies. The challengers argue that the section of the law governing subsidies -- which refers to exchanges ""established by the State"" -- applies only to the 16 states with their own exchanges.
Here's what's at stake: Some 7.5 million people have signed up for 2015 coverage on the federal exchange, healthcare.gov, and qualified for subsidies, as of mid-February, according to Kaiser Family Foundation calculations. The subsidies average $268 a month, covering 72% of the premium. Enrollees shell out $105 a month, on average.
The subsidies are key to keeping the system afloat. They serve as a carrot to attract a wide range of people -- most importantly, younger and healthier ones who might not opt for coverage if it were too pricey. They also soften the blow of the individual mandate, which requires nearly all Americans to have coverage or pay a penalty.
""The subsidies establish a stable risk pool,"" said Dan Mendelson, founder of Avalere Health, an advisory firm. ""There are a lot more people in the exchanges because of the subsidies.""
Billye Moutra and her husband couldn't afford their UnitedHealthcare plan if they didn't receive $901 in monthly subsidies. The Missouri City, Texas, couple have multiple medical issues and work part-time jobs to make ends meet.
""When the Affordable Care Act came along, it was an answer to our prayers, especially the subsidies,"" said Moutra, 59, who is in an air cast and on crutches for a torn tendon in her right foot.

For breast cancer survivor Melanie Goff Bradley, however, going without health insurance is not an option, even though it would be tough to afford without her $250 monthly subsidy. Goff Bradley, 58, pays only $429 a month for her Blue Cross Blue Shield plan.
The Rocky Mount, N.C., resident is finishing a degree in health information technology after her employer of 32 years shut down. If she lost her subsidy and couldn't quickly find work in her new field, she'd have to take a minimum-wage job or work as a waitress to pay for coverage. The thought of losing her insurance scares her.

In a partnership with Carnegie Mellon University, Uber is setting up a Pittsburgh lab called the Uber Advanced Technologies Center.
Uber said it will develop ""key long-term technologies that advance Uber's mission of bringing safe, reliable transportation to everyone, everywhere,"" including driverless cars, vehicle safety and mapping services.
Jeff Holden, Uber's chief product officer, said focusing on self-driving car technology serves as an investment in Uber's future. Why pay a fleet of taxi drivers if the company can build cars that drive themselves?
Google (GOOGL, Tech30) has been developing driverless cars for several years, partnering with major automakers and even building a prototype of its own self-driving car last year.
Related: Google's fully functional driverless car is adorable
Coincidentally, Bloomberg reported Monday that Google is developing its own driverless taxi service. Citing an anonymous source, Bloomberg reported that Uber board member and Google's chief legal officer, Dave Drummond, has informed Uber of Google's intentions.
But the Wall Street Journal, also citing an anonymous source, batted that notion down, calling Bloomberg's report ""blown out of proportion."" The Journal said that the app Google is developing helps its employees to carpool to work, and it isn't at all related to the company's self-driving car program.
Google declined to comment, but the company tweeted to Bloomberg Monday night, ""We think you'll find Uber and Lyft work quite well. We use them all the time.""
With its $258 million investment in the company, Google has long expected to partner with Uber once Google's self-driving car program was ready for passengers.
But as Uber takes self-driving cars into its own hands and Google potentially maneuvers to out-Uber Uber, these Silicon Valley friends could soon become frenemies.

Oil has more than halved in value since last summer and currently trades at around $51 a barrel.
BP (BP) said Tuesday it will cut capital expenditure by about 20% this year, and delay some investments as falling prices slam earnings.
""We have entered a challenging phase of low oil prices. Our focus must now be on resetting BP, while maintaining safe operations,"" said Chief Executive Bob Dudley said.

The company will reduce exploration and production spending to $20 billion in 2015 -- down from an earlier estimate of as much as $26 billion. Total capital expenditure was $22.9 billion last year, around $2 billion less than initially forecast.
BP is not alone. Chinese energy major  CNOOC (CEO) said Tuesday it will cut spending by as much as 35% this year. And Russian oil firm Gazprom (GZPFY) will slash spending by $8 billion this year, according to a Reuters report.
Last week, Royal Dutch Shell said it was scaling back its planned capital investment by $15 billion over the next three years. Chevron (CVX) said it would trim spending by 13%.
The impact of sliding oil prices has also prompted big job losses. Halliburton (HAL) plans to cut 1,000 positions due to the depressed oil market, while BP has also announced layoffs.
BP took a $3.6 billion writedown in the fourth quarter - largely due to the recent drop in oil prices - pushing the company to a $969 million loss for the period. Still, the group's earnings were not as bad as feared, and its shares gained 3% in London trading.
BP also reported a slump in earnings from its 20% stake in Russian energy giant Rosneft, which has been hit by Western sanctions imposed over Russia's action in Ukraine.

Who isn't? This study reveals that there is one sure-fire way to get it.
The study
Last year, the National Bureau of Economic Research with professors from the University of Pennsylvania, George Washington University, and North Carolina State University, released a study entitled ""Financial Knowledge and 401(k) Investment Performance.""
In it the authors found that individuals who had the most financial knowledge -- as measured through five questions about personal finance principles -- had investment returns that were on average 1.3% higher annually -- 9.5% versus 8.2% -- than those who had the least financial knowledge.
While this difference may not sound consequential, the authors noted that it ""is a substantial difference, enhancing the retirement nest egg of the most knowledgeable by 25% over a 30-year work life.""
Related: The Secret to Becoming a Successful Investor
Yes, knowing the answers to five questions had a direct correlation to having 25% more money when you retire.
So what are those questions? For example, and for the sake of brevity, here are the first three:

While the questions aren't complex, they're tough. And few people can answer all three correctly (with the answers being: More than $110, Less Than Today, and False).
Related: 3 Key Retirement Income Stats: How Do You Measure Up?
The results: So what did those people who were able to answer those questions most accurately actually do to generate the highest returns? The authors found one of the biggest reasons was that the most financially literate had the greatest propensity to hold stocks (66% of their portfolio was in equity versus 49% for those who scored lowest). And while their portfolios were more volatile, over time, they had the best results.
This is critical because it underscores the utter importance of understanding asset allocation. This measures how much of your retirement savings should be put in stocks relative to bonds. A general guideline is the ""Rule of 100,"" which suggests your allocation of stocks to bonds should be 100 minus your age. So, a 25-year-old should have 75% of their retirement savings in stocks.
Some have suggested that rule should be revised to the rule of 110 or 120 -- and my gut reaction is 110 sounds about right -- but you get the general idea.
Related: 3 Great Energy Stocks We're Buying Now
This vital distinction is important because over the long-term stocks outlandishly outperform bonds. If you'd invested $100 in both stocks and bonds in 1928, your $100 in bonds would be worth roughly $7,000 at the end of 2014. But that $100 investment in stocks would be worth more than 40 times more, at $290,000, as shown below:

Of course, between the end of 2007 and 2008, the stock investment fell from $178,000 to $113,000, whereas the bonds grew from $5,000 to $6,000, displaying why someone who needs the money sooner rather than later should stick to bonds. But a 40-year-old who won't retire for another 20 (or more) years can weather that storm.
Whether it's $100 or $1,000,000, watching an investment fall by nearly 40% in value is gut wrenching. But in investing, and in life, patience is key. As Warren Buffett once said, ""The stock market serves as a relocation center at which money is moved from the active to the patient.""

While everyone's personal circumstances are different (my risk tolerance is vastly greater now than it will be in 30 years) knowing that you can be comfortable allocating a sizable amount of your retirement savings to stocks will yield dramatically better results over time.

At a town hall style Q&A at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona Wednesday afternoon, the Facebook (FB, Tech30) CEO said he has one rule for hiring people to work for the social network.
""I will only hire someone to work directly for me if I would work for that person,"" he said. ""I think this rule has served me pretty well.""
Zuckerberg noted that hiring is a problem at Facebook, because there is more work to do than people to accomplish it. That can lead to hiring people who may not be the best candidate for a job.
So the Facebook CEO said that his team looks for people whose values align with the company's.
""Facebook is not a company for everyone in the world,"" he said.
Zuckerberg answered more than a dozen questions, fielded from people sitting in the audience and submitted online before the event. Here are some of the other questions posed to Zuckerberg, and his responses:
How do you start delegating to other people as you grow your own company?
""The most important thing is to keep your team as small as possible,"" Zuckerberg said. ""[Facebook] serves more than a billion people around the world but our team has fewer than 10,000 people. It's only possible because of modern technology. Big companies get bloated.""
What's the best tip you can give to young people with ideas to change the world?
""The most important thing is to just have faith in yourself and trust yourself,"" he said. ""When you're young you hear that you don't have experience to do things, that there are people that have more experience than you. I started Facebook when I was 19.""
""Don't discount yourself, no matter what you're doing,"" he added. ""Everyone has a unique perspective that they can bring to the world.""

How is Facebook working with governments who request greater censorship?
""We want to give the most voice to the most people possible,"" Zuckerberg said, explaining that this means complying with each country's laws after thorough investigation of issues that certain governments raise. ""We review each request very seriously and we push back every time we think something is too broad, which is a lot of the time.""
Recently with Russia and Turkey for example, Facebook deemed the countries' requests were legal.
""We may not have agreed with them,"" Zuckerberg said. But he noted that if Facebook denied the request to take down certain content, then these countries would have blocked Facebook and prevented tens of millions of people from using Facebook.
Related: The 3 places where Facebook censors you the most
What is Facebook doing to curb hate speech on the site?
""The line between factually untrue and disagreement of opinion is not always black and white,"" Zuckerberg said.
But if a lot of people report the same item, Facebook pays more attention to it. As a result, Facebook will show that piece of content less frequently in News Feed.
""A lot of freedom of expression often means sharing things people disagree with, [but] we have certain rules on this especially on the hate speech side,"" he said. ""Anything that incites violence or terrorism, we just take down immediately.""

What are Facebook's plans to get into other areas of technology, like Apple (AAPL, Tech30) and Google (GOOG) are doing with wearables and driverless cars?
Zuckerberg said that content will evolve toward video over the next few years and that the company is excited and focused on virtual and augmented reality.
""We're definitely looking into future technology,"" he said ambiguously.

2015-02-09 12:16:37,"Automakers don't protect you enough from car hackers, senator says - Feb. 9, 2015 ",http://money.cnn.com/2015/02/09/technology/security/car-hack/index.html,"Car makers are not doing enough to protect your safety and privacy from hackers, according to a new report from Senator Ed Markey.
We don't yet live in a world where hackers can crash your car. But computer engineers widely agree we're heading in that direction by connecting our cars to the Internet.
The report was put together by the senator's staff with the help of well-known computer security researchers. It found ""an alarmingly inconsistent and incomplete state of industry security and privacy practices"" by all of the world's largest car makers.
Every major car manufacturer -- from Ford (F) and General Motors (GM) to Nissan and Volvo -- was subject to inquiries from the Massachusetts senator. The only ones that didn't respond were Aston Martin, Lamborghini and -- perhaps surprisingly, given how vocal it is on these issues -- Tesla (TSLA).
The report builds on the idea that your car is a giant computer and can be hacked. Last year, CNNMoney explored how car makers are rushing to expose your car to outside connections (via cell phone networks, WiFi, Bluetooth) even though the inside of your car remains dumb and vulnerable.
It's a chasm that could have disastrous consequences.
The safety problem
Cars are now connected to the Internet. That means someday in the not-too-distant future, a hacker could knock your car off the highway.
Senator Markey's staff found that 100% of modern cars have wireless technology baked in -- establishing a new potential avenue for gaining access to your car. Meanwhile, the way automakers are protecting these access points is insufficient and ""haphazard,"" the report says.
For example, some automakers use encryption to protect how devices inside your car talk to each other (like your brake pedal and the actual brakes). Others don't do that.
Sometimes, car makers use a practice called ""whitelisting."" That means the tire pressure sensor can only talk to the dashboard -- but not the radio. But not all automakers do that either.
And even when they do these things, it's more about making sure the devices work than protecting you from outside hackers, according to the senator's report.
The secrecy surrounding this topic doesn't help either. Chrysler (FCAU), Mazda and Mercedes-Benz wouldn't even answer questions about how they secure their vehicles. Only Hyundai and Toyota (TM) provided ""detailed, question-by-question responses,"" the report said.
However, Ford, Tesla and Toyota have previously told CNNMoney that they have teams of hackers who probe their cars for weaknesses.
The privacy problem
In many ways, the modern car is a smartphone. Your behavior and movements are tracked and recorded.
The inside of your car just isn't the personal haven it used to be. In fact, this report shows that at least five car makers track your physical location ""at regular intervals,"" your car's speed and fuel, and the exact details of how you steer, hit the brakes, and use your seat belt.
Sure, it helps if a car maker can warn you about potential problems. But the data collection and sharing goes further than that.
The senator's staff found that 50% of car makers collect and transmit driving history to computer servers somewhere. And auto companies assert a right to share your information with marketers.
The report found that only two car makers let drivers disable data collection. Five companies let you delete data right from your dashboard. And just two automakers say they don't share your personally identifiable information.
In their defense, the auto industry recently agreed to general ""consumer choice"" principles that say customers must ""opt in"" for this kind of tracking.
But as the senator's report points out, this isn't enough. If you don't agree to GPS tracking, the car maker could block you from using navigation.
Senator Markey is now calling for federal regulators at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Federal Trade Commission to step in with clear-cut privacy and safety standards.

Amazon's plans for a drone-based half-hour delivery service known as Prime Air would remain grounded under the rules the Federal Aviation Administration proposed Sunday.
""The FAA's proposed rules for small (drones) could take one or two years to be adopted and, based on the proposal, even then those rules wouldn't allow Prime Air to operate in the United States,"" said Paul Misener, the retailer's vice president for global public policy.
Misener called on regulators to act faster: ""The FAA needs to begin and expeditiously complete the formal process to address the needs of our business, and ultimately our customers. We are committed to realizing our vision for Prime Air and are prepared to deploy where we have the regulatory support we need.""
Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) first unveiled the ambition of deliveries by drone more than a year ago, a move that put pressure on federal regulators to catch up with the interest from both the public and corporate America in drones, officially known as unmanned aircraft systems, or UAS.
Related: Drone pilot wanted, for a starting salary of $100,000
It expects a future where seeing a delivery drone ""will be as normal as seeing mail trucks on the road."" It hoped drone flights would be permitted as soon as 2015, but the rules aren't there yet.
Current FAA rules bar commercial drone flights, although about two dozen exemptions have been approved. CNN is among those pursuing news uses for drones though a partnership with the Georgia Institute of Technology.
The existing rules are more permissive of hobbyists.
Related: Alibaba is using delivery drones
The proposed rules would allow limited commercial flight by small drones weighing less than 55 pounds. The drone would be limited to heights of less than 500 feet and speeds under 100 mph, and must avoid airports, planes and restricted airspace. Operators would need to pass a basic test every two years and have a permit.
The biggest hurdles to Amazon's delivery ambitions: The operator must keep the drone within his sight at all times and must avoid people. He also must not allow ""any object to be dropped from the UAS.""
That would seem to preclude Amazon drones from flying into cities and leaving small packages on customers' doorsteps, all the while controlled by an operator back in the Amazon office.
Among the concerns of regulators is no doubt what Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said in announcing the plan: ""This thing can't land on somebody's head while they're walking around their neighborhood.""

Unless he doesn't return.
A growing number of people inside NBC believe he won't be able to return, but others are more optimistic.
The television news world -- simultaneously close-knit and cutthroat -- is preoccupied by the story. I have never seen anything quite like it.
Some are gleeful about what's going on, but many others are saddened by it. Many at NBC News are scared.
Fundamentally the network now faces a wretched business calculation: Is Williams -- the No. 1 news anchor in the United States -- too damaged to continue in the job? And are NBC's ratings and profits better off with him or without him?
To be clear, this is not what I'm asking. This is what NBC News officials are asking. In fact, they'd be derelict not to be asking.
The president of NBC News is Deborah Turness. Her boss is Pat Fili-Krushel, the chair of the NBCUniversal News Group, which also includes MSNBC and CNBC. Fili-Krushel reports to NBCUniversal CEO Steve Burke.
The trio of executives have said nothing publicly since Friday, when Turness confirmed that an internal fact-checking investigation was underway.
But this crisis is taking up all of their time. Politico reported that Burke held a meeting at his home on Sunday about it.
On Monday, the preliminary Nielsen ratings for last week's ""Nightly News"" came in, and they suggested further trouble.
Williams had been beating his main competitor, ABC's David Muir, all week, including Thursday, the day after Williams apologized on-air.
But on Friday, once the scandal had become a bigger national news story, Muir won by more than 300,000 viewers ages 25 to 54, the key demographic, and almost 500,000 total viewers.
Such a dramatic day-to-day swing is highly unusual in network news.
So will NBC executives make a decision about Williams' future ""based on the entirety of his career and not only one or two or three mistakes,"" as MSNBC's Joe Scarborough put it on Monday?
Or are the mistakes -- some are calling them lies -- and the resulting ratings trouble enough to end his career?
I've been talking to players on all sides and at all rungs of the industry's ladder, from anchors and presidents to associate producers. Everyone has an opinion, some more cynical than others. Everyone agrees Williams and NBC News have been hurt by his embellishments. Williams agrees too -- that's why he profusely apologized to his colleagues on Friday, and is said to be eager to speak more. Here's where people disagree:

Some say Williams has been telling tall tales for years, and it's finally caught up with him.
They say NBC has to replace him right away, the sooner the better, to stem the proverbial bleeding.
They think there's no way viewers will take him seriously anymore, not after #BrianWilliamsMisremembers became a trending topic.
Is there some schadenfreude and television back-stabbing going on here? Sure there is. Pains at NBC could pretty quickly translate to gains at ABC and CBS, its two big rivals in network news.
And as anyone in his position would, Williams has lots of detractors, just like he has lots of fans.
But the scrutiny is legitimate. It's rooted in something real, not just in wishful thinking from NBC's competitors.
Related: What we know about the controversy
Maureen Dowd of The New York Times wrote on Sunday: ""NBC executives were warned a year ago that Brian Williams was constantly inflating his biography.""
David Carr, also of The Times, wrote on Monday, ""Those of us who worked the Hurricane Katrina coverage rolled our eyes at some of the stories Mr. Williams told of the mayhem there.""
While NBC conducts its own internal fact-checking exercise, journalists from many other news outlets are looking for other discrepancies in Williams' past reports.
Some television critics have even started to call for Williams' resignation.
""There is no way to contain the damage. No way to continue. No way out,"" Newsday's Verne Gay wrote, adding, ""It's all over but the press release.""
One of my sources at NBC, who called Williams ""too big to fail"" on Thursday, took that back over the weekend and acknowledged it's now possible that he may be forced out.

Others say Williams is in trouble, but NBC should stand by him and let him regain trust.
These people -- including some at other networks -- are disturbed by the trial-by-Twitter that has enveloped Williams. They hope he can stage a comeback.
""I feel sad about Brian Williams,"" former CNN host Larry King tweeted on Sunday night.
Here's an important point: some TV anchors and executives are wondering what would happen if others' resumes and talk-show appearances were scrutinized the same way.
There's lots of talk about second chances and the benefit of the doubt.
MSNBC's Willie Geist said Monday that viewers ""have every right if they don't want to watch him anymore, that's their right. But... I think we should look at the totality of the man"" as well as the current controversy about misstatements.
That sentiment can be found all over the ""Nightly News"" Facebook page, too. ""Not watching until Brian is back,"" wrote one commenter. ""Tuning out until NBC grows a spine and backs Brian,"" wrote another. Some of these fans say they're tired of ""witch-hunts.""

So what's going to happen? No one knows.
On my CNN program ""Reliable Sources,"" I asked two veteran TV journalists -- Jeff Greenfield and Frank Sesno -- if Williams will return to the chair, and their answers were refreshingly blunt.
""We don't know,"" Sesno said. ""It depends where this investigation leads. It's just too much up in the air right now.""
Indeed, whether NBC has the stomach for all of this is an open question. The network has invested tens of millions of dollars in Williams.
It just renewed his contract last December -- he's set to be the ""Nightly News"" anchor for almost the rest of the decade. Before this scandal, his newscast was No. 1 in the ratings among both total viewers and 25- to 54-year-olds (although not as firmly No. 1 as it's been in the past).
But the current controversy now gets added to a long list of other challenges for the news division.
Burke, the NBCUniversal CEO, must have cringed at this Politico headline on Friday: ""The decline and fall of NBC News.""
Burke reports to Brian Roberts, the CEO of NBC's parent company Comcast (CCV). Roberts has a lot on his plate, including a pending merger with Time Warner Cable (TWC). I've known him to be the type of guy who hates distractions and controversies. He appreciates NBC News but he doesn't want it to embarrass him or his company.
Right now, this is embarrassing."

It is great news for Americans looking to travel overseas anytime soon. It's possible that the euro could reach parity with the dollar in the not-so-distant future. One euro is currently worth about $1.07.

Why are traders so worried about the bounce in the Benjamins? There are two key reasons.
Big American firms that generate a big chunk of sales abroad are likely to get hit when they report their quarterly results. Revenue from their international units will wind up looking weaker when they get translated back into American dollars.
Microsoft (MSFT, Tech30), IBM (IBM, Tech30), Procter & Gamble (PG), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Caterpillar (CAT) are just a few of the many blue chip U.S. firms that have already warned about what a stronger dollar will do to their sales and profits this year.
Still, this is the least of their concerns. The impact of fluctuating foreign exchange rates can be hedged by savvy financial departments. But the moves in currencies are not just a headache for a company's accounting and financial executives.

It's hard to hedge against cheaper prices. Remember that the strong dollar also makes the prices of products made by non-American firms look more attractive.
That works in the United States and in foreign markets.

Hershey (HSY) has been hit hard due to the stronger dollar too. International sales of its candy have fallen.
The stronger dollar is one reason why Katie Nixon, chief investment officer for wealth management at Northern Trust, thinks that earnings for the S&P 500 will increase by only 3% this year.
""The speed of the change in the value of the dollar has surprised many multinationals,"" she said. ""The impact on the competitive side is harder to hedge.""
Related: The bull market is six years old. Now what?
How much worse can it get? The dollar has already gained nearly 13% versus the euro this year.
But the dollar could appreciate even further now that the European Central Bank is finally buying bonds through a quantitative easing program while the Federal Reserve seems poised to raise interest rates later this summer.
Focus on companies with little foreign exposure. Simply put, higher rates should lead to a stronger currency.
That's why George Young, co-manager of the Villere Balanced and Villere Equity mutual funds, said that one way for investors to protect themselves from the strong dollar is to look for smaller companies that don't depend as much on international markets for growth.
Some of the fund's top picks are furniture and bedding supplies manufacturer Leggett & Platt (LEG) and Financial Engines (FNGN), a company that provides investment advice to workers with 401(k) retirement plans.
""We own mostly domestic companies. So foreign currency changes are not an issue,"" he said.
That strategy may do well for a while if the dollar continues to put the euro, yen and other currencies in an armbar like Rousey does to her helpless opponents.

2015-02-18 12:09:26,"On your Facebook feed: Your virtual reality experience? - Feb. 18, 2015 ",http://money.cnn.com/2015/02/18/technology/social/facebook-virtual-reality/index.html,"Forget plain, flat photos. In the future, Facebook wants you to share a 360Ëš view of your exotic experiences too.
Facebook (FB, Tech30) is working on integrating virtual reality into your newsfeed. The company's head of product, Chris Cox, explained the company's vision Tuesday night at the Code/Media conference in Dana Point, California.
Cox said Facebook has even developed a few demo versions.
In one, users can be virtually inside the cockpit of an F/A-18 Hornet flying over Colorado with the Blue Angels, the U.S. Navy's flight demonstration squadron. In another, a person can be transported to Mongolia and be inside a tent with a woman cooking food and a fire nearby or check out the sweeping vista.
""Not a lot of people are going to get to Mongolia in their life. I've never been,"" he said. ""You can look around. It's beautiful. And you immediately understand it's like one of these things ... the first time you're in it, you realize you're looking at the future.""
And people can share their experiences on Facebook. Cox said it adds another dimension to what people are sharing already: photos, videos, text, ideas, thoughts.
Last year, Facebook spent $2 billion to buy startup Oculus VR, which makes a virtual reality headset with visuals and audio.
At the time, Zuckerberg said that Facebook would help accelerate Oculus' plans to make immersive games and environments.
""But this is just the start,"" Zuckerberg wrote. ""After games, we're going to make Oculus a platform for many other experiences. Imagine enjoying a court side seat at a game, studying in a classroom of students and teachers all over the world or consulting with a doctor face-to-face -- just by putting on goggles in your home.""
On Tuesday, Cox said he expects average Facebook users to take part in this.
""You'll do it, BeyoncÃ© will do it,"" he joked.
But don't expect this to come out anytime soon. The Oculus Rift headset isn't even out yet for the general public, and there's no telling how popular (or expensive) it will be.
The wait time? ""Probably a while,"" Cox said. ""We're a long way away from everybody having those headsets.""

Ulbricht faced a series of charges, ranging from money laundering to drug trafficking to computer hacking.
Launched in 2011, Silk Road was an unregulated online marketplace where users could buy and sell anything from drugs to hacking tutorials. Payments were made using bitcoin, a digital currency that's difficult to trace, and the site used software that let users browse anonymously.
Related: Alleged Silk Road kingpin gets his day in court
Over the past weeks, prosecutors said Ulbricht was the mastermind behind the site. According to the feds, he went by the name Dread Pirate Roberts, a reference to a character in the movie The Princess Bride. They said they traced around $13 million in bitcoin to Ulbricht's computer. The defense argued that Ulbricht had created the site but passed it on to another operator but was lured back in as a fall guy.
In an exclusive interview before the verdict, Ulbricht's parents maintained their son's innocence.
""I think in 30 years, there would have been a glimmer among either of us,"" his mother, Lyn, said. ""This drug kingpin thing ...The guy was living in a very simple apartment, living a very simple life. So many things don't add up.""
The prosecution had a strong case against Ulbricht. During the trial, they presented chat logs, journal entries detailing operations, and the testimony of a college friend who said he helped Ulbricht create the site.
""Ulbricht's arrest and conviction -- and our seizure of millions of dollars of Silk Road bitcoins -- should send a clear message to anyone else attempting to operate an online criminal enterprise,"" read a statement from U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara. ""The supposed anonymity of the dark web is not a protective shield from arrest and prosecution.""

The agreement, first reported by Bloomberg, should drive more traffic to Twitter, and perhaps add to the company's current roster of 284 million active users.
Starting in the first half of the year, tweets will appear in search results as soon as they are posted, according to Bloomberg.

The deal is similar to a content-sharing agreement that Google (GOOG) and Twitter (TWTR, Tech30) had in place between 2009 and 2011. That deal was allowed to lapse, but Twitter is again under pressure to grow its user base.
Wall Street is worried that too few people are joining the service. The number of active users grew only 5% in the third quarter, and only 6% the quarter before that.
Twitter will report fourth quarter earnings on Thursday.
Shares popped this week after Twitter announced plans to start syndicating promoted tweets on popular magazine app Flipboard. The stock has gained nearly 15% so far this year, but is still off about 40% from its peak of nearly $70 in January, 2014.

Then the snowy calm. And then the questions about when business will return to normal.
Parts of the Northeast began digging themselves out Tuesday after a storm that shut down highways, mass transit and air travel.
By afternoon in New York City, where the hit wasn't as great as feared, the roads were largely cleared, subways were back in service and a strict travel ban imposed the night before had been lifted.
Flights began again from New York's LaGuardia Airport, where 11 inches of snow had accumulated by Tuesday morning. Spirit Airlines became the first major carrier with scheduled takeoffs and arrivals, the airline said. (The first departure was headed for Tampa, which chalked up zero inches of snow.)
At the same time, folks in the Boston area were bracing for several more hours of snow from a storm that was described as a potentially ""historic"" blizzard. They likely face a steeper climb to return to normal.
Air travel is where the impact is most readily noticed, and the ripple effect of canceled flights means it will likely be days before travel is back the way it was.
The airlines should be operating as usual by Friday, said Tulinda Larsen, president of the travel analysis firm masFlight. But rebooking passengers whose flights have been canceled likely will last into next week.
Thousands of flights were canceled on Monday and Tuesday, and masFlight estimated Tuesday morning that at least 400,000 travelers were affected by flight cancellations alone.
If you were planning on traveling by plane, train or automobile this week, here's what you need to know:

By train:
--Amtrak: The rail line canceled all Tuesday trips on several of its busy lines in the Northeast. It suspended Northeast Regional and Acela Express trains between New York and Boston, as well as Empire Service, Amtrak Downeaster, Vermonter and the Springfield line. The Lake Shore Limited and trains between New York and Washington, D.C., will conduct only partial service on Tuesday, Amtrak said. More from Amtrak.
--Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority: The greater Boston T said it will be closed all day and evening Tuesday. More from MBTA.
--New Jersey Transit: Service closed Monday evening but reopened on a reduced schedule on Tuesday. More from NJ Transit.
--New York City Transit: All service ended at 11 p.m. on Monday night but slowly returned on Tuesday. The nation's largest single public transport network ran additional trains on Monday afternoon to get commuters fleeing work early before the weather hit.

By road: The storm is making for slick roads, including along major highways like I-70, I-80 I-84 and I-95. Travel bans put in place Monday evening were largely lifted Tuesday morning, but in many places, the conditions were still rough. ""I am asking everyone in NJ who doesn't have to drive this morning please don't. And those that do, please drive slow,"" New Jersey Governor Chris Christie posted on Twitter around what would have been the Tuesday morning commute.
--Connecticut: Highways closed Monday evening but re-opened at 2 p.m. on Tuesday.
--New Jersey: A ban on driving in the state was lifted after daybreak on Tuesday.
--New York City: Roads, including bridges and tunnels into the city, closed at 11 p.m. Monday but were reopened Tuesday morning. A statewide ban on suburban counties was also lifted.
--Massachusetts: Many roads closed at midnight on Tuesday, and cars parked on major roads in Boston after 6 p.m. were at risk of being towed. Some roads were later re-opened, but the ban on travel along I-90, a major thoroughfare known as the Mass Pike, remained.
--Philadelphia: Cars parked on major city streets after 6 p.m. were towed.

By plane: More than 4,700 flights on Tuesday were canceled, according to the tracker service FlightAware, on top of the more than 2,800 flights canceled on Monday and hundreds more already scrapped for Wednesday. The three major airports in the New York area were among those most affected. Those cancellations will ripple out through the country and it will likely be days before service is back to usual.
--American Airlines (AAL) and U.S. Airways: American planned for only ""very limited operations (on Tuesday) in the Northeast,"" including in Boston, New York and Philadelphia. The airlines will let customers flying to or from two dozen airports in the region rebook reservations made for Monday and Tuesday without a fee. More from American. More from U.S. Airways.
--Delta Air Lines (DAL): The airline canceled all flights out of the three major New York-area on Tuesday after canceling approximately 600 flights scheduled for Monday. Customers were urged to rebook flights, and the airline said it would do so without no extra fee. It said service at New York's JFK and La Guardia airports was slated to resume on Wednesday morning. More from Delta.
--Frontier Airlines: Customers traveling from airports in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, and the Washington area may rebook without penalty. More from Frontier.
--JetBlue (JBLU): Flights in and out of the Northeast were canceled on Tuesday, and customers were allowed to rebook before February 1. More from Jet Blue.
--Southwest Airlines (LUV): It said customers traveling to and from the Northeast could reschedule without a fee. More from Southwest.
--Spirit Airlines (SAVE): The airline warned travel in and out of Boston would continue to be difficult through Wednesday. Travelers arriving at or departing from nine airports in the Northeast may reschedule their travel between now and February 3.
--United Airlines (UAL): The airline resumed some flights into and out of it's key hub, Newark, but said all flights to Boston and other New England-area airports were canceled through Wednesday.
--Virgin America (VA): The airline advised travelers headed into or out of Boston, New York, Newark or Washington airports on Tuesday that they may change their reservation without fees. More from Virgin America.

2015-02-17 07:27:15,"Obamacare sign ups top 11 million - Feb. 17, 2015 ",http://money.cnn.com/2015/02/17/news/economy/obamacare-enrollment/index.html,"About 11.4 million people have signed up for Obamacare coverage for 2015, the Obama administration announced Tuesday evening.
Consumers raced to apply before open enrollment ended Sunday, with more than a million people picking plans in the final nine days, officials said.
""It gives you some sense of how hungry people were out there for affordable, accessible health insurance,"" President Obama said in a video that was posted on the White House Twitter and Facebook accounts.
The tally includes people who signed up for the first time and existing consumers who were automatically re-enrolled for this year. Some 8.6 million signed up through the federal exchange, which is handling enrollment for 37 states, and 2.8 million in the state-based exchanges.
Florida and Texas, which have high rates of uninsured, each had more than 1 million people pick plans on the federal exchange, healthcare.gov. Their Republican governors were among the many who opposed Obamacare.
The overall sign-up number may grow somewhat in coming days. While open enrollment officially ended on Sunday, those who had trouble signing up because of technical issues or long wait times last weekend have a few more days. The federal exchange is allowing these consumers to enroll through Feb. 22, while most state exchanges have also extended their deadlines. There are fewer than 150,000 people ""in line,"" said Health Secretary Sylvia Burwell.
Pressure is also mounting on the White House to extend enrollment to April 15 for those who have to pay a penalty for being uninsured in 2014.
Related: Obamacare penalty payers ask, 'Where's my refund?'
Advocates argue that many Americans won't know they are subject to the penalty until they complete their taxes this year and that may prompt them to want to enroll for 2015. Up to 6 million taxpayers may be subject to the fine for 2014, which is $95 or 1% of income, whichever is greater. The penalty for lacking coverage this year grows to 2% or $325, whichever is greater.
Washington, which runs its own state exchange, has already made this move. Administration officials said they would make a decision in the next two weeks.
Related: I have to pay back my Obamacare subsidy
Obamacare is likely to meet or surpass its reduced enrollment goal of 9.1 million for 2015, though it will take time to determine how many of the people who signed up completed their enrollment by paying their premium. Roughly 85% of those who signed up completed enrollment last year, which would bring the 2015 number down to 9.7 million.
Enrollment is fluid since people can enroll mid-year if they lose their job or get divorced or leave the plan if they land employment or get married to someone with insurance. Burwell said she'd like enrollment to be at 9.1 million at the start of the next open enrollment season in the fall.
Also, the administration is in the midst of culling up to 200,000 enrollees from last year from the rolls because they have not proved their citizenship or legal status, Burwell said. Undocumented immigrants are not eligible for Obamacare coverage.
The administration sought to lower expectations last fall by reducing the target from the Congressional Budget Office's goal of 13 million. (The CBO since lowered its projection to 12 million.)
The vast majority of those signing up for Obamacare insurance are getting help to pay for their premiums. Some 87% of those who picked plans on the federal exchange are receiving subsidies that average $268 a month, as of Jan. 30, Burwell said. Nearly 8 in 10 consumers could pick a plan that cost as little as $100 a month with a subsidy.
This government assistance, however, is at risk. The Supreme Court will hear arguments on March 4 as to whether those signing up on the federal exchange can receive subsidies. The health reform law states that subsidies are based on coverage through exchanges established by states. A decision is expected in June.
Administration officials have repeatedly said they do not believe that the court will strike down subsidies, which has led to criticism that they are not developing an alternate plan in case they lose.
""We believe the position we are holding is the right position,"" Burwell said Wednesday."

Instead the 63 year-old from Illinois got a bill in the mail addressed to Super B---- Bauer.
That's after months of battling with Comcast (CCV) to get her cable service fixed so she could watch her favorite channel.
""I said, wait, I need to get my glasses on because I don't believe what I'm seeing,"" Bauer told CNNMoney. ""And there it was: Super B---- Bauer. So I've had it with Comcast.""
Bauer had been having trouble with her cable service since last April and she had called Comcast customer service ""hundreds of times."" In fact, technicians came to her home on about 39 occasions and it was eventually fixed.
On top of this, Bauer said she didn't receive her bill in November. When it arrived, she found that her rate had jumped by $50. She called to complain and was told that her two-year contract (which included the Hallmark channel) had expired and the channel was now part of a more expensive package.
So, she agreed to pay the higher rate. When Bauer finally got the bill Wednesday, it was addressed to Super B---- Bauer.
Related: Comcast vows to fix customer service
This is not a first for Comcast. Last month, the company sent a bill to Ricardo Brown addressed to A--hole Brown after he canceled his cable service.
Bauer said she told a friend who works for a local television station about the offensive name on her bill. The friend passed the tip on and the station immediately contacted Bauer about the story.
However, it turns out that that station is owned by Comcast and the story was killed.

Bauer (pictured above) got in touch with another local station. The story was set to air at 9 pm, she said. Just a minute or so before the broadcast, Bauer said she got a call from an apologetic Comcast manager.
The company also sent a statement to CNNMoney: ""We are continuing to investigate this thoroughly, and have reached out to our customer to apologize and try to make it right.""
But that hasn't changed Bauer's views on the company.
""Comcast is just the most disingenuous company on the entire planet,"" she said. ""I've been totally frustrated with them for a very long time.""

But the social media upstart apparently has no problem making its recent rendezvous with Saudi Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal something for the permanent record.
Alwaleed's Kingdom Holding Company investment firm put out a press release Sunday -- complete with two photos -- to announce that Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel had met with the prince in Saudi Arabia.
Could this mean that Alwaleed is about to make an investment in Snapchat?
Alwaleed, who is worth more than $22.9 billion according to the most recent ranking of billionaires by Forbes, already has an investment in Twitter (TWTR, Tech30). Kingdom also owns several other well-known U.S. stocks, including Citigroup (C) and Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox (FOXA). (Kingdom recently dumped almost all of its position in Murdoch's other company, News Corp. (NWSA))
Kingdom also owns a stake in Chinese e-commerce firm JD.com (JD), a rival to Alibaba (BABA, Tech30).

Snapchat and Kingdom were not immediately available for comment about the meeting.
But in its release, Kingdom said that the prince and other members of his investment firm met with Spiegel and Snapchat chief strategy officer Imran Khan. Kingdom said that Prince Alwaleed and Spiegel discussed ""political, business and economic issues"" as well as ""future potential business cooperation"" in technology.
Snapchat is one of the hottest companies in Silicon Valley. It is reported to be looking to raise more money in a round of financing that would value it at $19 billion.

That's the same amount that Facebook (FB, Tech30) paid to acquire rival messaging firm WhatsApp last year. Snapchat also reportedly turned down a $3 billion takeover offer from Facebook in 2013.
By all accounts, the company is intent on remaining independent.
Snapchat's Spiegel is worth $1.5 billion, according to Forbes.
Most recently, Snapchat announced a partnership to feature content from several big media companies, including CNN.

CheapAir.com analyzed nearly 5 million trips last year and found the best prices for domestic airfare were booked, on average, 47 days ahead of the departure date. The year before, the sweet spot was 54 days.
The online airfare shopping engine tracked prices from 320 days in advance up until the day before a flight and found the prime booking window was generally one to four months ahead of departure. The lowest price of a ticket changed around 70 times when it was for sale, the report found.
By booking on the cheapest day, fliers saved an average of $201 on airfare, excluding the 14 days before a flight since fares are much higher then. If those two weeks are included, the difference rises to $319.
Of course, there are no guarantees. Many factors can affect ticket prices, including time of year, the destination and local events.
""As much as everyone wants an answer for an exact number so they don't have to worry about finding the best price, it's not that simple,"" said Jeff Klee, CEO of CheapAir.com.
Related: Fly business class to London for 50% less
While booking the lowest price isn't an exact science, one thing is clear: procrastination doesn't pay. Buying tickets within 14 days of departure resulted in paying $111 more on average and $174 more when bought seven days in advance.
However, booking too early can also mean paying more. When a ticket is first offered, it's priced about $50 above its lowest point, according to the report. As time goes on, carriers start offering periodic short-term sales to fill seats.
""The odds of you paying the exact same price as the person sitting next to you is really small,"" Klee said.
Airline consolidation has impacted prices, he added. When one carrier offers a sale, the others are likely to follow suit to remain competitive. Less players in the game means less options for consumers. ""It used to be a buyer's market.""

The day you fly can also bring savings. Tuesday and Wednesday are the least expensive days to fly, said Klee, while Sunday and Friday were the most expensive.

However, booking too early can also mean paying more. When a ticket is first offered, it's priced about $50 above its lowest point, according to the report. As time goes on, carriers start offering periodic short-term sales to fill seats.
""The odds of you paying the exact same price as the person sitting next to you is really small,"" Klee said.
Airline consolidation has impacted prices, he added. When one carrier offers a sale, the others are likely to follow suit to remain competitive. Less players in the game means less options for consumers. ""It used to be a buyer's market.""

The day you fly can also bring savings. Tuesday and Wednesday are the least expensive days to fly, said Klee, while Sunday and Friday were the most expensive.
He also recommended searching flights early and often and be ready to pull the trigger. ""Prices change really frequently, people make the mistake of going home and talking to their family to figure out plans and come back the next day and it's gone."""

Staples (SPLS) announced Wednesday it intends to buy rival Office Depot (ODP) in a $6.3 billion deal, betting that the key to higher profits is operating on an even larger scale.
That's the same calculation Office Depot made not long ago, when it bought OfficeMax.
""Office Depot will make Staples bigger, and most importantly, we also believe Office Depot will make Staples better,"" Staples CEO Ron Sargent said on a conference call with analysts.
Over time, the multiple brands will be combined under ""one global name, Staples,"" he said.
An attempt to control costs
In this digital age, people just aren't buying pens and pencils like they used to, and Staples is feeling the pressure from all sides, including from giants WalMart (WMT) and Amazon (AMZN, Tech30).
That's why Staples last year announced plans to close 12% of its stores. It currently has upwards of 1,300 locations in the United States, and securities filings show Office Depot has about 1,900.
The struggling office supply retailer said the merger will mean cost savings of about $1 billion per year.
Staples will ""better optimize our retail footprint (and) minimize redundancy"" -- business language that usually means more store closings and layoffs, although management did not address the scope of potential cuts.
It will also continue to offer more than the traditional paper and printer ink.
""Next year, we'll be pushing to 50% of our sales are not office supplies anymore,"" said Sargent. ""We have a well-developed copy and print operation ... (and) we are now selling over a million"" individual items online, he said, and Office Depot touted its furniture business.
Second attempt at a merger
The purchase announced Wednesday would unite the three brands, but it still must be approved by regulators.
The government scuttled a previous merger attempt between Staples and Office Depot in 1996, but approved the Office Depot and OfficeMax deal more recently.
Staples said the talks that produced this deal began in September.
A deal was pushed by Starboard Value, an activist investor that owns a stake in both companies. Earlier in the week, investors cheered rumors that a deal was close. In premarket trading on Wednesday, Staples slipped about 2% while Office Depot climbed over 6%.
Postal workers object
The deal is strongly opposed by members of the American Postal Workers Union, who say it would lead to higher prices for consumers and layoffs for employees.
The union called on the FTC and the Justice Department to block the merger.
""Staples is an anti-worker corporation, and we don't want to see its reach expanded,"" said the postal union's President Mark Dimondstein. ""We will vigorously oppose this merger. It's bad for workers and bad for consumers.""
Postal workers have criticized Staples for years for operating ""mini post offices"" in dozens of stores. The union says the locations, which are staffed by Staples employees, are exacerbating the Postal Service's financial problems.

Why? The winner from Puerto Rico will likely pay significantly lower taxes than the winners from Texas and North Carolina.
The unknown factor is whether the winnings from a ticket sold in Puerto Rico are considered a Puerto Rican source of income. If so, the winnings won't be subject to U.S. federal income taxes.
The IRS needs to weigh in but could not immediately be reached for comment.
""This is the first time they've had a winner [in Puerto Rico],"" said Joy Hail, a senior tax analyst at Wolters Kluwer Tax & Accounting U.S. ""We haven't seen any guidance released from the IRS.""
Puerto Rico, which is a U.S. territory, has only been included in the Powerball since October 2014.
""I don't know that this scenario has been discussed,"" Hail added.
Hail said the Puerto Rican tax code specifies that prizes from lottery winnings are exempt from income tax. Instead, prizes are subject to a special tax, which ranges from 5% to 20% of the total winnings.
""Because of the amount of the winnings here, the Puerto Rico resident would be subject to a 20% tax on their winnings,"" she said.
That sounds like a lot. But the combined federal and state income taxes that U.S. residents pay will be more. (For instance, in North Carolina, it would come to about 45%.)
Powerball winners can choose to be paid over the course of many years, in which case they'd get one-third of the $564.1 million. But most opt for a lump sum payment, which would make the total about $381 million. Assuming that's what the Puerto Rico winner chooses, Hail said the winnings would be about $127,046,150 -- and the lottery tax will be $25,409,230.
The fact that there's a winner who likely won't have to pay U.S. income taxes is sparking controversy. Many have taken to Twitter to air their frustrations, politically correct or not.
Some are outraged that a winner would not have to pay federal taxes. Others are simply disappointed that this has stirred up racial tensions.
""I can't believe people show their hidden racist persona when someone from Puerto Rico wins the Powerball. They all should be ashamed,"" tweeted @boricualuterano.

Despite an improving economy, nearly 90% of Americans surveyed by the American Psychological Association said the level of stress they are feeling about money has either remained the same or gotten worse in the last year, according to the group's annual Stress in America report.
Nearly three-quarters of the people surveyed said they had stressed about money at some point in the last month, while more than a quarter said they are stressed about money most or all of the time.
People living in lower-income households, parents of children under 18, Millennials and Gen Xers were among those most likely to report high levels of money stress.
Related: America's 10 Most Stressed Out Cities
Overall, top sources of money-related stress include: paying for unexpected expenses, paying for essentials like housing and groceries and saving for retirement.
Money woes are also keeping some people from taking proper care of their health: 12% of respondents said they had skipped a doctor's visit because of financial concerns, while 32% said their finances prevented them from living a healthy lifestyle.
After financial issues, Americans singled out work and family responsibilities as two other major sources of stress in their life.

The survey also noted a growing gap in the stress levels between households earning less than $50,000 a year and those earning more than that amount, noting that the divide ""mirrors the growing wealth gap nationwide.""
Related: Hungry, tired and stressed out
The survey found that stress over money is preventing many Americans from living healthy lifestyles as they try to cope using unhealthy behaviors like smoking or drinking alcohol. Meanwhile, many reported that their stress levels were causing depression or affecting their romantic relationships.
""This year's survey continues to reinforce the idea that we are living with a level of stress that we consider too high,"" APA chief executive officer Norman Anderson said in a statement. ""All Americans... need to address this issue sooner than later."""

Facebook (FB, Tech30) is working on integrating virtual reality into your newsfeed. The company's head of product, Chris Cox, explained the company's vision Tuesday night at the Code/Media conference in Dana Point, California.
Cox said Facebook has even developed a few demo versions.
In one, users can be virtually inside the cockpit of an F/A-18 Hornet flying over Colorado with the Blue Angels, the U.S. Navy's flight demonstration squadron. In another, a person can be transported to Mongolia and be inside a tent with a woman cooking food and a fire nearby or check out the sweeping vista.
""Not a lot of people are going to get to Mongolia in their life. I've never been,"" he said. ""You can look around. It's beautiful. And you immediately understand it's like one of these things ... the first time you're in it, you realize you're looking at the future.""
And people can share their experiences on Facebook. Cox said it adds another dimension to what people are sharing already: photos, videos, text, ideas, thoughts.
Last year, Facebook spent $2 billion to buy startup Oculus VR, which makes a virtual reality headset with visuals and audio.
At the time, Zuckerberg said that Facebook would help accelerate Oculus' plans to make immersive games and environments.
""But this is just the start,"" Zuckerberg wrote. ""After games, we're going to make Oculus a platform for many other experiences. Imagine enjoying a court side seat at a game, studying in a classroom of students and teachers all over the world or consulting with a doctor face-to-face -- just by putting on goggles in your home.""
On Tuesday, Cox said he expects average Facebook users to take part in this.
""You'll do it, BeyoncÃ© will do it,"" he joked.
But don't expect this to come out anytime soon. The Oculus Rift headset isn't even out yet for the general public, and there's no telling how popular (or expensive) it will be.
The wait time? ""Probably a while,"" Cox said. ""We're a long way away from everybody having those headsets.""

Obamacare's second enrollment period, which ended in February for most Americans, went far more smoothly than the first, which was marred by technical trouble at the kickoff.
Nearly 11.7 million people have signed up for health insurance for 2015 through the Obamacare exchanges, federal officials said Tuesday. Some 8.8 million picked plans on the federal exchange, which is handling enrollment for 37 states, while the remaining 2.8 million went through their state-based exchange.
Administration officials touted the fact that the number of Americans lacking insurance fell to record low levels, as measured by the Gallup poll. Only 12.3% were uninsured for the first two months of 2015, compared to 17.1% in the first quarter of last year.
It remains to be seen, however, how many people actually complete their Obamacare enrollment by making their first month's payment. Officials said they'd release 2015 enrollment information later this spring.
A year ago, some 8.1 million people had signed up for Obamacare plans by the end of the initial open enrollment period, officials said at the time. About 6.7 million people were ultimately enrolled in Obamacare plans, the administration said in the fall.
Still, it's likely the Obama administration will reach its goal of 9.1 million enrollees for 2015.
Related: Obamacare will cost less than thought
Obamacare attracted millions of new customers this year. Some 4.7 million people, or 53%, were new enrollees.
Among those who had coverage last year, just over half actively chose a plan, as federal officials suggested. The rest were automatically re-enrolled. Officials pushed 2014 enrollees to investigate their options since many more insurers joined the exchanges this year, changing the pricing for most plans.
For those signing up on the federal exchange, healthcare.gov, some 87% received federal subsidies to help them afford the monthly premiums. The subsidies totaled $263 a month, on average, leaving consumers to pay $101.
These subsidies are at the heart of the next battle for the administration. The Supreme Court is currently deciding whether those signing up on the federal exchange are eligible for subsidies. The section of the health reform law governing subsidies refers to exchanges set up by states.
Related: What could kill Obamacare
The breakdown of those picking plans for 2015 closely mirrors last year's. About 28% of consumers in both years were age 18 to 34, while 11% were Latinos. Obamacare attracted somewhat fewer blacks, with 14% signing up this year, versus 17% last year, though administration officials said fewer people indicated their race on the application.
Open enrollment is now closed for most Americans, except for those who learn they owe a penalty for being uninsured in 2014. They can enroll for 2015 coverage between March 15 and April 30, thus avoiding a penalty for this year.

2015-02-23 11:33:21,"4 money saving tips when visiting Disney World - Feb. 23, 2015 ",http://money.cnn.com/2015/02/23/media/disney-world-savings-tips/index.html,"The ""Happiest Place on Earth"" just got more pricey.
But visiting Mickey Mouse doesn't have to break the bank. Take it from me -- I go to Florida's Walt Disney World at least twice a year.
There's plenty of ways a family can save on Disney (DIS) dollars, even if the price of entry to the Magic Kingdom is now over $100 a person.
Here's four simple money saving tips for families planning a visit to the house of mouse:
1. Avoid single park tickets
The most expensive item at Disney World is the price of a ticket to each of the different parks.
The best route is to avoid single park tickets altogether and buy a ""Park Hopper"" instead.
A ""Park Hopper"" allows you to hop from one Disney park to another in a single day, and it's only an additional $50 per person.
So you'll be paying roughly $160 for each ticket. But that will give you the option to visit all four of Disney's Florida parks -- not an impossible feat for a single day, thanks to Disney World's incredibly reliable bus and monorail system.
2. Watch what you eat
Disney's food prices can rival that of some Manhattan restaurants, so watch what you eat.
Instead of spending money on a quick $6 hot dog, take the time to really explore what the parks have to offer.
If you're having trouble figuring out where to eat, Disney offers dining plans like ""Tables in Wonderland"" that offers a 20% discount on food and drink.
You're not going to find any ""cheap"" meals at Disney per se, but I personally prefer the Magic Kingdom's ""Columbia Harbour House,"" EPCOT's ""Via Napoli,"" and Hollywood Studios' ""50's Prime Time CafÃ©."" All of these offer slightly higher quality food than the regular fare.
3. Try to stay on the property, but during the off season
Some would say you save more by staying at hotels just off Disney property, but I'd argue otherwise.
When you stay on property you get free and steady bus transportation to and from parks, along with transportation from the airport via Disney's ""Magical Express"" bus line.
Not to mention, Disney hotels have a ton of free activities going on all the time for people of all ages.
Disney World offers dozens of hotels ranging in price from $69 to $517 a night, but if you go during the off season like September or January, you could avail of discounts.
4. Make a spending plan and stick with it
Disney World is designed to get you to spend money on everything from Mickey pretzels to mouse ears.
This is why it's important for families to sit down and plan beforehand on what extras and gifts you want to purchase.
Make a financial plan, map out where and when you're going, ask cast members (Disney employees) for advice, and stop when you've hit your limit.
If you do that you won't have to wish upon a star in order to save money at Disney World.

2015-02-15 09:34:48,"Here's what to really fear about the stock market - Feb. 15, 2015 ",http://money.cnn.com/2015/02/15/investing/stocks-markets-investing-bubble/index.html,"Six years into the bull market in stocks and there's no shortage of scary things on investors' worry list.
From Vladimir Putin and Greece to the dramatic plunge in oil prices, something is bound to trip up the stock market, right? After all, the good times on Wall Street can't last forever.
But the key to knowing where stocks are going next is focusing on the real risks to the market, not the irrational ones.
Fear a bubble in bonds, not stocks: Yes, stocks are up over 200% since the 2009 lows. And yes, the Dow is once again trading above 18,000 and the S&P 500 just hit a new record.
But stocks are barely positive on the year. Valuations look a bit lofty, but not insanely high. There are good reasons for stocks to be up: The U.S. economy is humming along, the jobs market is finally looking strong and corporate profits continue to smash records.

Related: Greed is back! Stocks at all-time highs
It's much tougher to justify what's going on in the bond market. The yield on the 10-year Treasury isn't far from an all-time low. That usually happens during times of market stress, not when stocks are soaring.
It's even stranger abroad. The yield on 10-year bonds from Portugal -- a country rumored to be on its way out of the eurozone not long ago -- tumbled to a record low of 2.3% last week. That's down from a whopping 16% in 2012.
Yields have actually tumbled into negative territory in Belgium, Denmark, France, Japan, the Netherlands and Switzerland. Think about that. Investors are basically willing to lose money when they buy these government bonds. And even some corporate bonds, too.
Given the low levels of liquidity in the bond market, it's scary to think about what happens when the bond bubble eventually pops.

Related: So much for the bond bubble bursting
Fear reluctant consumers, not tumbling oil prices: The crash in crude prices has spooked investors worried about how it'll impact corporate profits and what it says about the health of the global economy.
While those are valid concerns, there is mounting evidence the plunge in oil prices is mostly being caused by too much supply, not a sharp decline in demand. And while energy profits are shrinking big time, the consensus is that cheap oil is a net positive for the U.S. economy.
What's really needed is for American consumers to feel confident enough to spend the estimated $750 they're saving on gas this year, not just save it or pay down debt. That's critical because consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of the U.S. economy.
Yet retail sales in January crept up just 0.2% from December, even after excluding auto and gasoline sales. Spending actually decreased on items like furniture, clothing and sporting goods.
That needs to change for the economy to kick into a higher gear.
Related: The stock market needs American spending
Fear the Fed doesn't raise rates, not a June hike: After six years of emergency care from the Federal Reserve, the U.S. economy finally looks healthy enough to stand on its own two feet.
No, it's not in perfect shape. Inflation is still running well below the Fed's 2% target. Wage growth remains a sore point for American workers.
But it would be scarier for investors if the Fed doesn't ultimately raise rates later this year. It would raise questions about whether the central bank has boxed itself into a corner with low rates and leave Fed Chair Janet Yellen and her committee with fewer tools to respond to future shocks.
If the Fed waits too long to raise rates it also risks inflating another asset bubble just like 10 years ago when cheap credit fueled the housing bubble.
Related: Making money as the Fed hikes won't be easy
Fear Europe's future, not the current Greek drama: Investors freaked out earlier this year when Greece elected the anti-austerity Syriza party. The stock market in Athens plummeted and Alan Greenspan predicted the euro's demise as talks over a revamped Greek bailout stumbled.
But the real fear shouldn't be about Greece. It does seem likely the new government will eventually reach a deal with Greece's creditors.
The bigger question mark is whether leaders in Europe will get their act together fix the continent's sleepy economy for the long run.
Not only must the European Central Bank carry out its promise to stimulate the economy through bond purchases, but national leaders have to do their part, too. They need to push through politically painful economic reforms to drive future growth.
Related: Europe is a mess. Should Americans buy now?
Bottom line: Most experts still believe the U.S. stock market will rise in 2015. But with the major averages at or near record highs, it's hard to blame investors for closely scrutinizing the health of the global economy before jumping in to buy more stocks."
2015-03-06 12:01:22,"Germany quotas: New 30% rule for women on boards - Mar. 6, 2015 ",http://money.cnn.com/2015/03/06/news/women-boards-germany-30/index.html,"Germany has just made a radical move to promote gender equality in the boardroom.
The German parliament passed a new law Friday requiring the country's biggest companies to appoint women to 30% of the seats on their non-executive boards from 2016. The plan is to increase the quota to 50% from 2018.
The new rules apply to about 100 of Germany's biggest listed companies, where shareholder and employee representatives make up the supervisory board.
A number of big German companies, including Adidas (ADDYY) and financial services firm Allianz (AZSEY), already meet the 30% quota. However, many others lag behind, including Volkswagen (VLKAY), which only has 15% female representation on its board.
Thousands more smaller German companies are also required to set binding targets this year for increasing the number of women on their supervisory boards and executive committees.
The new quotas will also apply to senior leadership positions in the public sector.
Related: Best and worst countries for women on corporate boards
Catalyst, a group that lobbies for women in business, says research shows that companies with diverse boards attract more talented employees, are more innovative, and have greater financial success than companies where men dominate.
However, many people are opposed to fixing binding quotas for women, arguing that unqualified people may be given positions in order to satisfy the rules.
Other critics argue that the German law doesn't do enough to tackle the gender imbalance on top management teams, where the real power lies. A supervisory board provides general oversight and appoints top executives, but is not involved in setting strategy or daily corporate affairs.
Currently, Norway has the best record for women on boards, according to Catalyst. In 2003, the country passed a law requiring at least 40% of corporate board members to be female. At present, nearly 36% of board members are women.
The situation is very different in Japan, which is known for having a low rate of female participation in the workforce. Women in Japan hold about 3% of all board seats at major companies.

2015-02-26 10:51:53,"FCC adopts historic Internet rules - Feb. 26, 2015 ",http://money.cnn.com/2015/02/26/technology/fcc-rules-net-neutrality/index.html,"The FCC has passed a historic measure to more strictly regulate the Internet.
The new rules, based on the principles of ""net neutrality,"" act to provide equal opportunity for Internet speeds and access to websites.
The central question was whether network owners -- like Comcast (CMCSA) or Time Warner Cable (TWC) -- can discriminate what runs on their cables. The FCC's answer on Thursday was: No.
The Democratic-led commission approved 3-to-2, split along party lines, to assert extra government authority over the Internet.
Now for the wild claims on both sides: ""We saved the Internet!"" or ""We've destroyed it with government bureaucracy!""
Don't believe the hype. Take a deep breath. It's a long, tricky road ahead.
The FCC rules won't be official until maybe summertime. Then major telecom companies will challenge new rules in court. A judge might put the rules on hold. The next president, if Republican, could let this fizzle away.
That's why, in the near term, nothing changes. No, Netflix won't suddenly stream any faster. No, AT&T and Comcast won't abruptly stop laying down high-speed fiber cables in your neighborhood as retaliation. And yes, Netflix can still cut deals with broadband companies for faster access to a network.
So what just happened, exactly? The FCC just granted itself the power to defeat a raging, fire-breathing monster: the monopolistic network owners who can kill Internet freedom by blocking websites -- or by creating an Internet fast lane for the privileged, few, rich tech companies that can pay for it.
But this monster is actually a phantom menace. Sure, in the past, telecoms have been bullies. Verizon blocked Google Wallet. AT&T blocked video chatting apps. Comcast slowed down file-sharing services like BitTorrent. Rural telephone provider Madison River blocked Vonage's over-the-Internet phone calls. However, the FCC used existing rules to fix those problems.
The new rules essentially maintain the status quo. The Internet sure feels free today. It'll feel the same way tomorrow.
That's why some worry about how the FCC just ensured net neutrality. To enforce fairness rules, the agency will regulate network owners by scooping them up under Title II of the 1934 Telecommunications Act, a specific set of regulations that apply to phone companies. Telecoms say the rules don't match the services they provide. They don't trust the FCC's promise that it will apply only a tiny fraction of those rules and won't regulate rates and increase taxes.
""Assurances like these don't tend to last very long,"" warned Republican FCC Commissioner Ajit Pai. ""Expect ... regulation to ratchet up as time goes on.""
Meanwhile, Tom Wheeler, the FCC chairman who ditched his original dialed-back plan for this one, assured this isn't a government power grab.
""This is no more a plan to regulate the Internet than the First Amendment is a plan to regulate free speech,"" he said. ""They both stand for the same concept: openness, expression and an absence of gatekeepers.""
How did we start caring about this? Credit comedian John Oliver, who got enough viewers of his HBO show that a record 4 million Americans sent comments to the FCC.
He framed it from the point of view of the average person dealing with their Internet service provider. Plans are expensive, service is inexplicably spotty and you have little choice. Clearly, the network owners are the bad guys.
During Thursday's hearing, the testimony of those who spoke in favor of the FCC's new rules all took that populist tone. Etsy CEO Chad Dickerson thanked the FCC for ""protecting the Internet as an engine for economic opportunity."" Celebrated technologist Sir Tim Berners-Lee said this ensures modern entrepreneurs the same opportunity he had when he created the World Wide Web 26 years ago.
After the vote, President Obama issued this statement via Twitter: ""Today's FCC decision will protect innovation and create a level playing field for the next generation of entrepreneurs.""
But wait, there's a third option. As this fight makes its way through the courts, Congress has the opportunity to stand up and write rules that work too.
After all, both network owners and the websites that flow data through them have a point. Outright blocking and anti-competitive behavior is unfair and should be illegal. On the other hand, for technical reasons, network owners need to manage traffic. Your video stream needs to move faster than your email for your experience to feel smooth.
That's why critics call the Title II approach -- what the FCC did today -- a blunt instrument. But it's not clear that it's as wonderful -- or terrible -- as everyone says.
Rob Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a technology policy think tank, laments how the conversation has spiraled out of control.
""This has become a debate about a false choice: letting carriers do whatever the heck they want and overly burdensome regulations,"" Atkinson said.

A recent study conducted by researchers at Nanyang Technological University, Bradley University and the University of Missouri Columbia found that heavy Facebook (FB, Tech30) users can experience envy -- which can ultimately lead to extreme sadness.
The researchers surveyed 736 college students and found that, basically, if you quietly stalk your friends on Facebook and then realize that your life doesn't measure up to theirs, you feel bad about yourself.
""If Facebook is used to see how well an acquaintance is doing financially or how happy an old friend is in his relationship -- things that cause envy among users -- use of the site can lead to feelings of depression,"" said Margaret Duffy, a professor at the University of Missouri School of Journalism.
This isn't just a college phenomenon. I am nearing middle age and I can relate.
Facebook is a huge part of my life. Like most Facebook users, I have the app on my phone. I check it at work. I check it at home. I check it when I am out. If I am in a subway station with Wi-Fi, I check it there too.
I am up to date on all my friends, their kids and whatever they are reading at that moment. Unfortunately, it's an addiction that I can't quit.
Facebook has allowed me a little window into my friends' lives back home. They have babies -- well some of them have teenagers. They have lovely homes. And the dinners -- oh the dinners they serve! There are food presentations that look like something out of a Martha Stewart magazine. I watch all the videos of their kids saying the darndest things. I click on their pictures of vacations in exotic places.
I have come to the conclusion that Facebook is a lifestyle magazine featuring my friends, who are doing it better than me.
I peruse Facebook from computer on my coffee table, because I am not grown up enough to buy a desk for myself. My coffee table is my all-purpose table. I eat there too -- usually hunks of cheese with a knife and no crackers. That's right no crackers, because I am too lazy to run out to the bodega.
My only consolation is sometimes my friends confuse ""there,"" ""their"" and ""they're"" in their posts about their lovely vacations and darling children. Then suddenly, I feel a little bit better about myself.

Over the last year, one in four people who left pets with the organization cited problems finding pet-friendly housing. The organization started tracking the numbers this year after staff noticed that housing issues were becoming an increasingly common problem, according to spokesperson Krista Maloney.
An influx of highly-paid tech workers in recent years have pushed out many low- and middle-income renters and driven rents higher. With limited space to build on and tight regulations, the short supply of housing in the city has only made matters worse.
Competition for each apartment is so fierce that landlords can afford to be more selective about tenants, said Mark Campana, president of Anchor Realty, which does not allow pets in any of its roughly 1,000 units.

""Now with the market moving with great speed and with vacant units in high demand, an owner doesn't have the incentive to be pet-friendly,"" said Campana.
Michael Harrington, president of Pacific Union Property Management, said that while some landlords may be flexible about allowing small dogs, they know they can always find another tenant without an animal.
""We're definitely in what I would call a landlord's market,"" said Harrington.
Just because a unit is advertised as pet-friendly doesn't mean it will go to a pet owner, said Dr. Emily Weiss, vice president of research and development at ASPCA.
That might explain why data from online rental listing company, Lovely, showed that the percentage of listings that said they allowed ""some pets"" actually grew from 34% to 39% between 2012 and 2014.
Pet-friendly options also tend to be more out of reach for low-income renters, said Weiss. According to a recent analysis of listings by HotPads, pet-friendly units in San Francisco cost an average of 12% more than those that don't allow pets. That's compared to a national average of 3.5% in major metro areas, the company found. And that doesn't include pet deposits or additional ""pet rent,"" which may be required on top of normal rent.
San Francisco even lags behind New York City, where the share of dog-friendly apartments is almost three times higher and just over half of all landlords allow ""some pets,"" according to Lovely. Yet, pet ownership in the city has long faced the same challenges that the SPCA is seeing in San Francisco, said Sandra DeFeo, executive director of the Humane Society of New York.
""People with more means tend to find places that will accept them with pets,"" she said.
Jackie Tom, president of leasing company RentalsinSF, said it was hard enough finding an apartment that would accept her Great Dane 15 years ago. Today, the market is even more stressful and more expensive for pet owners, she said.
""There are a lot of wonderful pet owners and not enough affordable housing for them,"" said Tom, who manages 35 pet-friendly units in the city. ""They can keep their pets, but there is a price.""

Eric Andresen, president of the San Francisco Apartment Association and Viking Services Corp., which manages about 2,300 housing units in the area, said he would be surprised if the housing crunch really made the city less pet-friendly overall.
He notes that many residents have learned to skirt landlords' pet restrictions by claiming their pets as assistance animals, abusing laws meant to help people with disabilities. The problem has become so widespread in recent years that Andresen recommends landlords simply allow pets so they have some control over the animals in their buildings.
""Then at least you can protect yourself with a pet deposit,"" said Andresen. ""And it certainly puts your relationship with your tenant in a more cooperative place."""

Why?
It's part of the deal between the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and ABC, the official broadcaster of the academy's annual awards show. ABC is the only channel allowed to be live from the red carpet between 7:30 and 8:30 p.m.
Most viewers don't know about the deal, and that's why there are surprised (and perturbed) tweets right after the 7:30 mark every year. (Here's an example from last year.)
But it seems to have the desired effect -- that is, steering viewers to ABC, first for the fashion sightings and celebrity interviews, and then for the actual awards show.
ABC has televised the Oscars every year since 1976. Its deal with the academy was going to expire in 2014, but the two sides renewed it three years early, in 2011, and now it's set to run through 2020.
Related: Why the 'best' picture doesn't always win
The deal allows ABC's rivals to have spots along the red carpet and to broadcast and stream live interviews. CNN, the owner of this website, airs a red carpet special starting at 6 p.m. Eastern. E! and a newbie entertainment channel, Pop TV, also have multiple hours of live coverage.
But the live coverage has to stop at 7:30. (CNN and Pop TV sign off at that time; E! keeps going, but only shows videotape and photos from the red carpet, no live pictures.)
What's in the $160,000 Oscars gift bag
In an amusing twist, the other networks can keep interviewing stars on the carpet -- but they can't show the interviews until after 8:30.
The carpet area actually closes at 8 p.m. But ABC's exclusive window of time extends until 8:30 because that's when its special pre-show ends and the awards show begins.
""Oscar's Red Carpet Live,"" as the ABC special is called, scored 27.6 million viewers for the 8 to 8:30 p.m. portion last year, and the awards averaged 43.7 million.
ABC declined to comment on the terms of the deal.

The national average for a gallon of regular gas jumped nearly 40 cents a gallon in that period, to $2.43 a gallon, according to AAA.
That's the longest streak of increases in about two years, pushing average price back above $2 a gallon in all 50 states. In January, more than half of U.S. gas stations were selling gas for less than $2, and the national average stood at $2.03 a gallon.
Despite the price increase, drivers are still saving money at the pump. Prices are currently 90 cents a gallon below where they were in September 2014, and the U.S. Energy Information Administration forecasts that the typical American household will save $750 on gas this year.
In January, before prices bottomed out, a gallon of gas was selling for less than the cost of the crude used to make it, according to Tom Kloza, chief oil analyst for the Oil Price Information Service, which tracks prices on behalf of AAA.
Related: What's gas cost in your state?
Those low prices prompted refiners to cut back on production, Kloza said. He expects prices to rise through March as refiners prepare to switch to more expensive summer blends of gasoline.
But crude prices are still very low. Weakening economies in Europe and Asia, as well as more fuel efficient vehicles, have all cut worldwide demand for crude. An increase in U.S. oil production, which made the nation the world's largest source of oil last summer, has also pushed prices down, as has OPEC's refusal to cut production. A strong dollar is also pushing prices lower.
Related: Scared OPEC members want meeting but Saudis call the shots
One factor that has not affected prices, according to Kloza, is a refinery strike by the United Steelworkers union. Management has kept these refineries up and running despite the strike, so it's had little impact on gasoline production and prices.
Kloza expects prices to top out at about $2.50 to $2.70 a gallon, before turning lower once again. By this summer or early this fall, he predicted, gas will be back below $2 in many areas.

Apple CEO Tim Cook teased it in September. And on Monday, he revealed the last remaining details during an event in San Francisco Monday.
""I've been wanting to do this since I was 5 years old, the day is finally here,"" Cook said about the watch's ability to make and receive phone calls.
The Apple Watch will be available for pre-order in nine countries, including the U.S., on April 10. (The other countries are Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United Kingdom.)
Customers will start receiving watches on April 24. That's also when they will go on sale online or by reservation at Apple stores.
As expected, the cheapest model -- the Apple Watch Sport -- is 38mm high from the top to the bottom of its rectangular face. It costs $349. The 42mm version costs $399.
The stainless steel model will start at $549 (38mm version) and $599 (42mm size). Prices will then go up to $1,049 and $1,099. Although Cook did not say, it's likely the range will depend on the type of band that's paired with the watch.
The high-end version, called the Apple Watch Edition and made from 18-karat solid gold, will start at $10,000.
The Apple Watch Edition will only be available in certain Apple stores, Cook said.
""The Apple Watch Edition is the most beautiful expression of the Apple Watch,"" he said.
In order to work, the Apple Watch needs to be paired with an iPhone. Users running iOS 8.2 must download the Apple Watch app.
Battery life has been a concern. Cook said the Apple Watch battery will last up to 18 hours. ""That should work for most people I think,"" he said.
Cook was most excited about some of the device's features. You can receive calls on your Apple Watch, for example.
You can send other Apple Watch users doodles, taps, and your heart beat with its new ""digital touch"" technology. ""This is the most personal device we have ever created,"" Cook said. ""We're introducing a whole new way to communicate.""
To promote its health and fitness features, Apple (AAPL, Tech30) gave an Apple Watch to model and activist Christy Turlington, who recently ran a half marathon in Africa wearing the watch.
Turlington appeared with Cook on stage to talk about her experience. ""The race was pretty challenging so I was checking it quite frequently,"" she said.
A number of third-party apps will be available for use on the watch. Among them are Uber, the W Hotel, American Airlines and Shazam.
CNN will be one of the apps as well when the Apple Watch launches next month, letting users engage with CNN content. Users will be able to tap to open a story and then choose to save it or continue reading on the phone. They can also use the watch to launch live CNN TV on the phone.

2015-02-27 10:27:01,"The answer to New York City's housing crisis: Smaller apartments - Feb. 27, 2015 ",http://money.cnn.com/2015/02/27/real_estate/microapartments-new-york/index.html,"New York City has a housing problem: Real estate is too expensive, and there's not enough of it.
The city is betting on solutions like My Micro NY, a pioneering new project that's currently in construction, with prefabricated units smaller than most existing studio apartments. The units are being constructed locally, and will eventually be assembled in downtown Manhattan.
The apartments will be for one to two people and range in size from 250 to 350 square feet. New York isn't exactly known for huge apartments, but these units are so small that the project received a one-time exemption from city zoning codes to make the building possible.
Related: Tiny living around the world
About 40% of the 10-story building will be designated as affordable housing, and while the specific rent prices have not been confirmed, the building's project manager, Tobias Oriwol of Monadnock Development, said studios in the area go for $3,000 to $3,200. The market-rate apartments will be around that price, but slightly less because of the smaller size.
Those who qualify for affordable housing will pay even less, depending on their income.
""The whole point is making studios affordable to people who right now would be living in a converted or shared situation, which they wouldn't do if they could afford to live elsewhere,"" Oriwol said. ""This is another housing type that should be offered to people in New York City.""
Rents in the city rose by 75% between 2000 and 2012, according to a 2014 report by the New York City Comptroller's Office.
The city's mayor, Bill DeBlasio, has promised to build and preserve 200,000 affordable housing units over the next decade.
Related: I bought a house for $1,000
Because of the limited space, architect Mimi Hoang of nARCHITECTS, focused on what she could add to make up for what the unit would lose.
""If you are to shrink the average size of the unit, what should you gain in return,"" she asked. ""What do you get back in micro-living?""
The answer: Light and air.
She added windows that are larger and taller than they need to be. She also added ceilings that are nearly 10 feet high. Juliet balconies are also part of the design, and the windows open to the street.
""When you open them you feel like you're connected to street life and the neighborhood,"" Hoang said.
The building will also offer a communal study room, a fitness center and an outdoor patio, among other amenities.

Fluorescent colors that look like they came straight out of a highlighter are taking over the sports world in a big way. They will be featured in this week's Super Bowl.
They're all over the Australian Open. They were a big part of last weekend's Pro Bowl and NHL All-Star games. They were in this year's college football playoffs, and they will make several March Madness appearances.
The neon spectacle across multiple sports isn't a coincidence. Fluorescent colors are currently trending with young people -- the target demographic of sports equipment makers.
""Uniform designers have come to the realization that kids prefer fluorescent colors,"" said DayGlo Business Manager Brian Skelly. ""We've definitely seen a spike in sales in the last couple years.""
DayGlo, which manufactures fluorescent pigments, recently conducted a study, which found that children prefer neon colors four-to-one over conventional colors. The company also found that customers stop to look at brightly colored clothing twice as long as they spend looking at non-fluorescent items.
""It's a cliche, but kids do like shiny objects,"" said Paul Lukas, who reports on sports uniforms for his Uni-Watch blog and ESPN. ""The neon and fluorescent colors you see on sports uniforms play into that. When teams change their uniforms, the first question is, 'How will this sell?'""""
Sports uniform makers have gotten the message. Nike (NKE) redesigned the Super-Bowl-bound Seattle Seahawks' uniforms in 2012 to include neon green highlights and trim. Nike also designed the highlighter-like Australian Open outfits, Pro Bowl uniforms and Oregon Ducks jerseys.
Reebok's 2015 NHL All-Star uniforms featured fluorescent green stripes -- a standout for a typically conservative league. Unsurprisingly, Reebok said it had young fans in mind when designing the uniforms.
""To showcase the heroes of the game, we thought we could have a design more targeted towards a younger demographic,"" said Dom Fillion, Reebok's lead designer. ""We think it will get them excited about the game.""
Since none of the NHL teams feature neon colors on their uniforms, Reebok is turning to team-licensed apparel such as t-shirts and hats to feature the popular color.
""Demand for these colors has definitely gone up,"" said Keith Leach, Reebok's director of NHL merchandising.
Hot, bright colors have been around for a few decades. They were big in the 1980s, but they didn't have quite the same vibrancy that they do today. Ultra-bright colors have become far more prevalent in recent years, because fabric and dye technology has vastly improved.
Today's fluorescent colors pop more, they don't rub off on your skin and they stay bright after washing them, DayGlo's Skelly noted.

""It's definitely having an impact on what people are buying,"" said Leatrice Eiseman, executive director of the Pantone Color Institute. ""It's a huge attention-getter; the human eye cannot avoid looking at a color with that much intensity and sparkle.""
But Pantone's Eiseman isn't so sure about its lasting impact.
""I think that just like most trends, they have their moments,"" she said. ""It's just a given in the fashion world that a trend can only last so long. The consumer will eventually look at fluorescent colors as ho-hum.""
But Lukas expects the neon craze to stick around for a long time, as sports apparel makers Nike, Adidas (ADDDF) and Under Armour (UA) try to outshine one another -- literally.
DayGlo also believes fluorescents will be here for the long haul, calling the current trend ""more than just a moment.""
So your eyes may get a rest in a few years. But don't count on it.

The company removed the ""feeling fat"" emoticon Tuesday after a backlash from a group that said it makes fun of people who feel overweight. More than 16,700 people signed a petition on Change.org demanding Facebook take the emoticon down.
""We've heard from our community that listing 'feeling fat' as an option for status updates could reinforce negative body image, particularly for people struggling with eating disorders,"" Facebook (FB, Tech30) said in a statement.
Before Tuesday, the ""feeling fat"" face was one of many emoticon options for Facebook users to post in a status update.
The activist group, Endangered Bodies, considers the change a win.
""This success shows us that people together can challenge the cultural messages that are so damaging to our ability to love ourselves and live comfortably in our bodies,"" wrote Catherine Weingarten, who spearheaded the petition.

It has struck a deal to sell up to 2,400 of its approximately 4,000 stores and wireless company Sprint (S) will create a ""store within a store"" in up to 1,750 of those.
RadioShack said that its remaining stores are expected to close.
The company's franchise locations, as well as stores in Mexico and Asia, are not included in the deal.
But RadioShack is not completely going away. Customers will still be able to purchase RadioShack products, services and accessories at the approximately 1,750 stores where Sprint will open shop. In fact, Sprint will occupy just one third of those locations, where it will sell devices and plans. The stores will be ""co-branded,"" according to a Sprint spokeswoman.
The bankruptcy announcement is no surprise. The New York Stock Exchange suspended trading of its shares on Monday. And RadioShack  (RSHC)workers have told CNNMoney that some locations have already been converted to clearance stores.
It's been a long, slow decline for RadioShack. Losses have been mounting, and in its latest quarter sales plunged 16% from a year ago.
Cash-strapped, RadioShack found itself saddled with more than 5,000 stores at the beginning of last year, many of which it couldn't afford to keep open.
Related: 94 years of hits and misses at RadioShack
But closing stores is expensive, due to the cost of severance, liquidating merchandise and paying penalties to get out of leases.
And RadioShack has been so low on cash it couldn't afford to close enough of the stores strangling its business.
Last March, the company announced a plan to close about 1,100 stores, but it was only able to close 175 stores through the end of October. By year's end it was battling with its lenders to get the green light to close more.
Once upon a time, RadioShack bragged about its vast retail network, saying that 90% of the U.S. population lived or worked within a few minutes of a RadioShack location.

But with online shopping, those brick-and-mortar stores became dead weight.
RadioShack goes back to 1921, when it opened a store and mail-order operation in Boston to serve the needs of radio officers aboard ships. It was bought in 1963 by Tandy Corporation, a retailer that started as a supplier of leather parts to shoe repair shops.
For a time RadioShack prospered from Americans' growing love affair with technology. It introduced one of the first mass-market personal computers, the TRS-80, in 1977, and one of the first laptops, the Model 100, in 1983. It also was an early seller of both cell phones and satellite television systems.

The stock price for AMC Networks at that time? Just below $67. The stock price today? Just below $67.
So does ""Breaking Bad"" prequel ""Better Call Saul"" -- which debuts this Sunday -- need to be a big hit for AMC (AMCX)? You better believe it.
""AMC needs more scale. Their biggest problem is not enough visibility,"" said John Tinker, an analyst with Maxim Group who covers AMC.
The cable channel has struggled to find new blockbuster shows after ""Breaking Bad.""
AMC has renewed Revolutionary War drama ""Turn"" and ""Halt and Catch Fire"" -- a show about the PC industry in the 1980s -- for second seasons. But they have not come close to duplicating the critical and ratings success of ""Breaking Bad.""
The tale of chemistry teacher/meth kingpin Walter White became a ratings juggernaut by the time it ended.
The series finale was watched by more than 10 million viewers ... a solid number in the increasingly fragmented world of media. And it was averaging 5.4 million viewers for its final season before the last episode.
It would be a huge shock if the ratings for ""Better Call Saul"" -- which will debut Sunday and air its second episode Monday night in what will become its normal time slot -- comes anywhere close to that.
David Joyce, an analyst at Evercore/ISI who follows AMC, says he's hoping that about three-quarters of the viewers who routinely watched ""Breaking Bad"" will want to check out ""Better Call Saul."" That works out to about 4 million.
Related: African-Americans propel prime time TV hits like 'Empire'
But the expectations for ""Better Call Saul"" are much higher than when ""Breaking Bad"" debuted in 2008.
At that time, ratings were relatively low. It wasn't until people started binge-watching the show on Netflix (NFLX, Tech30) that it became a true phenomenon.
""Better Call Saul"" doesn't have the luxury of being a sleeper that slowly builds an audience. Adding to the pressure? AMC is also about to lose ""Mad Men"" as well.
The last episodes of its final season will begin to air in April. ""Mad Men"" is more of a critical fave than commercial blockbuster. But it put AMC on the pop culture map when it debuted in 2007.
The network used to be known as American Movie Classics. Before AMC gave us Don Draper, it mainly aired movies and reality shows.
Sure, ""Better Call Saul"" is going to be on Netflix too. Episodes won't air in the United Sates until after the first season wraps up this spring though. But they will be available in the United Kingdom just a day after they are on AMC.
Still, a Netflix bump won't help AMC as much as you might think. The prime beneficiary will actually be Sony (SNE), since it's the studio that produces the show. It also was the studio behind ""Breaking Bad."" (AMC doesn't own ""Mad Men"" either. Lionsgate (LGF) does. So it gains the most financially from being on Netflix.)
Related: Breaking Bad's Aaron Paul has a new app
Fortunately for AMC, its biggest hit is also set to come back this Sunday: zombie saga ""The Walking Dead."" And AMC owns that show. That means it reaps all the financial benefits from streaming deals.
Tinker said it would be great if AMC could develop more blockbuster shows that it owns outright. But any successes will do.
Higher ratings help attract advertising dollars and could also give AMC more leverage when it is negotiating new contracts with cable and satellite TV operators to carry AMC and its other networks, such as IFC and Sundance.
Related: AMC CEO says 'zombies are thriving'
To that end, AMC warned DirecTV (DTV) subscribers of a possible blackout and urged fans of ""The Walking Dead"" last year to ""make your voice heard"" by contacting DirecTV. The contract expired at the end of last year but the channel is still on DirecTV.
""If you don't have hits right now, you're in a world of pain. Just look at Discovery,"" Tiinker said, referring to Discovery Communications (DISCA). That stock, despite big promotional stunts like Shark Week, has been one of the worst-performing media stocks of the past year.
So will ""Better Call Saul"" lift AMC stock out of its funk? That remains to be seen.
But if the ratings are underwhelming, investors might follow some advice that Saul gave Jesse Pinkman during ""Breaking Bad"" and sell the stock.
""It's the way of the world, kid. Go with the winner."""
2015-01-20 01:17:48,"MSNBC shuns guest who made racially charged remark about Jindal - Jan. 20, 2015 ",http://money.cnn.com/2015/01/20/media/msnbc-arsalan-iftikhar-bobby-jindal/index.html,"MSNBC is distancing itself from a guest who asserted on Monday that Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal ""might be trying to scrub some of the brown off his skin.""
Arsalan Iftikhar, a human rights attorney and commentator, made the racially-tinged remark on MSNBC's ""Now with Alex Wagner."" It immediately prompted criticism.
An MSNBC spokeswoman told CNN on Tuesday morning that Iftikhar won't be appearing on the channel again.
""We found this guest's comments offensive and unacceptable, and we don't plan on inviting him back,"" the spokeswoman said.
Iftikhar didn't immediately respond to a request for further comment. But on Monday night, he told CNN, ""I will apologize to Bobby Jindal when he apologizes to seven million American Muslims for advancing the debunked 'Muslim no-go zones' myth.""
Jindal did no such thing on Tuesday. Instead, he faulted MSNBC for giving Iftikhar a platform in the first place. The governor compared Iftikhar's criticism to liberal filmmaker Michael Moore's recent assertion that ""snipers aren't heroes.""
""It's embarrassing for MSNBC to give voice to such shallow foolishness,"" Jindal told CNN in a statement. ""Much like Michael Moore denigrating our military servicemen, these comments deserve no comment.""
He continued: ""I will not be silenced. Radical Islam must be stopped and we must stop pretending. It is time for the Western world to face reality. These are not cultural differences, this is the difference between right and wrong. It is wrong to treat women as second class citizens and it is wrong to shoot civilian teenagers in the head for watching soccer on TV. Period.""
Iftikhar was responding to the Republican governor's statements, during a speech in London, about supposed ""no-go zones"" for non-Muslims in Europe.
The idea of ""no-go zones"" -- where Islamic law is allegedly observed and where local police fear to operate -- has been widely circulated by right-wing media outlets, but has been contradicted by officials in France, Britain and elsewhere who say it's an exaggeration not supported by the facts.
British Prime Minister David Cameron has pushed back on the idea, saying that, ""when I heard this, frankly, I choked on my porridge and I thought it must be April Fools Day.""
On Saturday, Fox News apologized for a number of its recent segments about ""no-go zones.""
After his speech on Monday, Jindal's decision to invoke ""no-go zones"" was scrutinized by political analysts; some concluded that he is trying to position himself for the upcoming Republican presidential primaries by ratcheting up his rhetoric against radical Islam.
In interviews with CNN, Jindal was asked for specific examples of ""no-go zones"" but did not name any.
He commented to CNN's Max Foster that ""the radical left absolutely wants to pretend like this problem is not here.""
On MSNBC, a favorite channel of liberals, Wagner read that quote to Iftikhar. He pounced, ascribing political motivations to Jindal's stance.
""I think Governor Jindal is protesting a bit too much,"" he said. ""He might be trying to, you know, scrub some of the brown off his skin as he runs to the right in a Republican presidential exploratory bid.""
Jindal is Indian American. He was raised Hindu, and converted to Roman Catholicism as a teen.
Iftikhar added, ""I think it's the worst common denominator of American politics -- to marginalize any minority demographic group. I'm pretty sure that Governor Jindal will come to his senses, hopefully in the next couple of days.""
Iftikhar's comment immediately drew complaints from conservatives.
""MSNBC upped the ante in their quest to attack Republicans on Monday when a guest made aÂ racially charged attack,"" wrote the Washington Free Beacon.
Web sites like The Daily Caller and The Right Scoop also picked up on Iftikhar's remark.
Iftikhar appears on MSNBC and CNN regularly; he recently garnered press attention when CNN's Don Lemon asked him if he supported the terror group ISIS.
Now he's gaining attention for a very different reason. He laid low on social media after Monday's MSNBC appearance, choosing not to respond to tweets like this one from conservative political strategist Matt Mackowiak: ""Your outrageous, racist, bigoted, disgusting attack on @BobbyJindal requires an immediate, public apology."""

The U.S.-made gun will have same name as the original: AK-47, arguably the most ubiquitous assault rifle in the world.
The gun will be made by American company RWC, which is the official importer and distributor of Kalashnikov AK-47s. The company had to stop importing the guns after the U.S. imposed sanctions in July against Russia for its role in the Ukraine crisis.
RWC said it is not permitted to have any contact with the Russian company, Kalashnikov Concern, which makes the AK-47s.
""We are not permitted to pick up the phone and to talk to them,"" said Thomas McCrossin, CEO of RWC, which owns the Kalashnikov USA brand. ""We were forced to stop doing business with them because of the sanctions.""
RWC, based in Tullytown, Pa., has the rights to the AK-47 Kalashnikov brand of guns, which has been produced in the Soviet Union after World War II.
It is arguably one of the most famous firearm brands in the world. The original AK-47s are made by the 200-year-old Russian company, but it is one of the most copied assault rifles in the world with knock-offs made all over the globe, including China, Europe and the U.S.
Related: AK-47s become hot commodity after U.S. sanctions
Demand for Ak-47s -- already very high in the U.S. -- has surged after the sanctions.
For now, the company has enough guns to meet the demand.
""I have a lot of inventory on my shelf bought and paid for,"" McCrossin told CNNMoney in Las Vegas at the annual gun industry show. ""We are permitted to sell these weapons because they were already in the U.S. But when the inventory goes down to zero, there are no more.""
McCrossin plans to change that with a new factory that will make the first AK-47s in the U.S.
""In the second quarter of this year we are going to start manufacturing here in the U.S.,"" said McCrossin. ""What I'm manufacturing are our own AK-47s and shotguns under the Kalashnikov brand.""

CNNMoney has reached out to Kalashnikov Concern in Moscow for comment, but hasn't heard back.
McCrossin said he's shopping around for a location for the factory. He said that he plans to hire people, but he wouldn't say how many.
He made the announcement at the Kalashnikov USA booth at the SHOT Show. The booth carried the slogans ""Russian heritage"" and ""Made in USA."""

And rich people are rushing to buy passports in search of safe places to shelter their families and their money.
Many countries offer so-called golden visas that grant residence permits and, in some cases, citizenship in exchange for sizable investments. The investments are typically made in bonds, property or cash donations to the host government.
The programs are luring growing numbers of nationals from the Middle East, China and Russia. And demand is expected to increase as political instability drives rich individuals to seek economic and geographic safety.
""Wealthy people are looking for safe places to relocate in case of crisis,"" said Armand Arton, chief executive of Arton Capital, a company that advises on investor citizenship programs.
He said demand is growing by as much as 15% per year, and the threat of ISIS in the Middle East along with international sanctions in Russia will continue to fuel interest. Investors are also lured by the promise of visa-free travel, plus access to education and services.
Related: Rich Russians buy U.K. investor visas in record numbers
Among the beneficiaries are the U.K., which has seen a record number of applications from Russia as economic conditions in the country deteriorate.
Experts advising on investor permits for Ireland, Malta and Bulgaria also reported steady interest from Russia last year.
During the same period, an influx of Chinese applicants exhausted U.S. supplies of investor visas.
The bulk of the golden visa programs are clustered in Europe, many of which were devised following the financial crisis as a way for cash-strapped governments to boost revenues. A number of countries in the Caribbean also open their borders to rich investors.
The costs vary widely. Cyprus will make you a citizen for a cool â‚¬2.5 million investment ($2.9 million) in real estate. Dominica -- a tiny nation in the Caribbean -- offers citizenship for just $100,000.

The industry is expanding and Arton said the number of countries offering investor visas has more than doubled in the past 10 years.
And as competition intensifies, nations are attempting to make their programs more attractive. For example, Bulgaria will fast-track citizenship if investors double their â‚¬512,000 ($594,600) investment.
The cash-for-passports industry has been running for about 30 years. Schemes first cropped up in North America, Australia and the U.K. -- safe places for wealthy citizens looking to relocate or invest their funds.
These regions accept the highest numbers of investor migrants. Data from Arton Capital shows that smaller countries including Bulgaria, Portugal and St Kitts and Nevis also issued several hundred investor visas in 2013 -- while Hungary granted 1,075.

One the newest and most expensive plans is already generating plenty of interest. Launched in early 2014, Malta charges $1.4 million for citizenship. Advisory firm Henley & Partners helped design the program, which has received 400 applications from more than 40 nationalities so far.
But the bar to entry is high, and not just financially.
""They are very careful about who they will take,"" said Mark Stannard, managing director Henley & Partners Malta. ""Quite often an application is not accepted."""

Personal submarines are the latest must-have accessories for wealthy yacht owners looking for exciting ways to enjoy the water.
A decade ago, so-called ""submersibles"" were rarely found outside scientific and military circles but private use has spiked over the past few years. The market has grown alongside the jump in wealth for the top 1%, and a drop in the average age of millionaires.
""The younger, more adventurous owners want more out of their yacht than just sitting on the back drinking a cocktail,"" said Graham Hawkes, founder of luxury sub maker DeepFlight.
DeepFlight makes two-person submersibles that resemble underwater jets. They cost at least $1.5 million and can typically dive to around 120 meters, or what founder Hawkes describes as the edge of darkness.
Clients, who include entrepreneur Richard Branson and venture capitalist Tom Perkins, are chasing unique encounters with ocean life in comfort and safety. Hawkes recalls coming face to face with a Great White shark while teaching Branson to ""fly"" the submarine.
""We were gobsmacked,"" Hawkes said. ""That 30 seconds was worth everything, the 20 years of effort. It was just awe inspiring.""
The machines are custom made but DeepFlight is considering moving to regular production runs as the market grows. In the last few years the company has sold 2 or 3 each year, and this could rise as high as 10, according to Hawkes.
Triton Submarines is another firm benefiting from growing demand: Chief executive Bruce Jones said the company has more orders than ever. At $3.5 million, the Triton 3300/3 is the company's most popular model. This sub carries 3 people and dives to around 1,000 meters.
""It's quite an unusual experience to go down deep in a submersible, [so owners] are heroes with their family and friends,"" Jones said.
But before shelling out for a personal submarine you'd really have to own a superyacht to berth it on. Superyachts cost hundreds of millions of dollars, and the smallest are about the size of a tennis court. Some are four times as big. With that in mind, Jones said a typical Triton client would be worth around $500 million.
Those who can scrape the cash together could soon find themselves behind the wheel of a luxury sub. DeepFlight and Triton offer pilot training but there's no specific license required.
""Nobody buys the a Ferrari to give the keys to a chauffeur,"" Deepflight's Hawkes said.

Tulips are in peak season by the time Valentine's Day rolls around and -- bonus -- usually cost a fraction of the price.
Most tulips are imported from Holland, and overall tulip imports to the U.S. are on the rise, increasing by 1.3 million bulbs between 2012 and 2013, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.
The Midwest has seen the biggest increase in tulip sales over Valentine's Day, according to BloomNation, a flower service company that supports about 3,000 florists nationwide. Around 35% of Valentine's Day sales last year were in tulips for that section of the country, compared with 10% for the West.
""Our customers tend to be on the adventurous side,"" said Eric Phillips, the lead floral designer at Dilly Lily florist in Chicago, Ill. ""People are definitely more open to integrating tulips rather than just sticking with a more traditional design.""

He said tulips have been a hot item, and he's been featuring them in the lead-up to Valentine's Day.
""People are looking to get something extravagant and gorgeous, but as a whole, people are still trying to be conservative. When buying tulips versus roses you can find that bargain,"" Phillips said.
At his shop a customer can get a bunch of ten tulips for around $10, the cost of just one red rose.
Americans are expected to spend $18.9 billion on Valentine's Day-related gifts this year. That's the highest ever, according to a National Retail Federation survey. Nearly 40% of those surveyed plan on buying flowers.
Fresh Tulips USA, one of the leading tulip producers in the country, sells about 100 million tulips a year, with Valentine's Day sales accounting for about 15% of the business, according to spokesperson Adam Corl.
""Tulips have a clean aesthetic that fits in with modern taste,"" Corl said. ""People seem to be moving away from roses.""
But it's still a slow switch. Roses for Valentine's Day are wildly popular, and about 224 million of them are grown for the holiday every year. But a dozen usually cost about $80 or more. Prices vary depending on location and quality.
""The Midwest has always seen a higher price point for roses,"" said BloomNation co-founder David Daneshgar. He said that's because the majority of roses are imported from Colombia and Ecuador, and the Midwest is furthest from the ports of Miami and Los Angeles, where the flowers come in.
He said the switch is a win for florists and customers, because it's cost effective for the buyer and lets the florists get creative.
""They can get away from the whole cookie-cutter-red-roses thing and put their heart into these different arrangements,"" he said."

When Daniel Kottke reminisces about his college days in the early '70s, he describes them as pretty prosaic. A freshman dorm room filled with books on spirituality, Pink Floyd playing in the background, a pastoral college campus -- and hallucinogens.
The only thing, he says, that was in any way remarkable about his LSD trips was his fellow traveler: Steve Jobs.
Kottke was one of Apple's first employees, and before the world knew Steve Jobs as the creator of Apple, Kottke knew him as a friend he used to trip with at Reed College.
He was uncomfortable discussing these experiences while Jobs was alive, but was willing to share them with CNNMoney now.
""We would take psychedelics and whole new vistas opened up,"" Kottke said.
The two initially bonded over their interest in ""Be Here Now,"" a book on things like psychedelics and spirituality. This became the foundation for a fast friendship.
""We were monk-wannabes,"" Kottke said. They were on a quest to better understand consciousness using an LSD varietal known as Orange Sunshine as their Sherpa.
""We were ... in a meditative space,"" Kottke said. ""But that's partly because we were reading books about chakras and psychic energy and the chi and the Kundalini serpent that was going to rise up our spine.""
Kottke had access to LSD, and Jobs was an enthusiast. They would read, go on hikes and wander the rose gardens at Reed College. Jobs has been quoted as saying that LSD was one of the most profound experiences of his life, and the name for Apple came from his experience working on the apple farm of another fellow tripper from Reed.
Kottke moved to Palo Alto in 1976 to be one of the only staffers in the Apple Garage, working on the very first Apple I computer. He was not an engineer but developed a curiosity about how chips worked, spending his free time reading Byte magazine and the manual for the 6502 processor.
Showing the prototypes to CNNMoney, Kottke recalled that from the very beginning, Jobs was obsessed with making every aspect of the product as aesthetically appealing as possible -- even the appearance of the circuit board. From one iteration to the next, Jobs demanded that the RAM chips be moved further apart, even though the only way they'd be seen was if the computer was broken open.

Jobs was working the phones, and Kottke's main role was testing circuit boards. Steve Wozniak would come work at night after his day job at Hewlett Packard. The company was based out of the garage for about a year, moving into a real office a few months after it was incorporated in January 1977.
At that point, the drug-fueled search for salvation had mostly faded.

""Once Apple started, Steve was really focused with all of his energy on making Apple successful."" Kottke said. ""And he didn't need psychedelics for that.""
Wozniak was also not interested in dropping acid, according to Kottke.
""Woz was in very close touch with the extent to which his mind is a miracle of nature. He's just fantastically interested in things ... His mind was always working perfectly well and [he] didn't want to mess it up,"" Kottke said.
As the company grew, Kottke and Jobs drifted.
Just a few years before Jobs' death, it was psychedelics that put Kottke back in touch with Jobs. Albert Hoffmann, who discovered LSD, was turning 100 and soliciting financial support for psychedelics research. Kottke was asked to connect Hoffmann with Jobs, which he did; but Kottke doesn't believe that the introduction resulted in any monetary contributions.

A one-day ticket to the Walt Disney World Resort's flagship theme park, the Magic Kingdom, now costs $105, up from $99. Prices had been jacked up by $4 just last year.
The price of admission applies to anyone 10 years and older entering the Orlando-area theme park. Younger children, aged 3 to 9, pay $99 to enter the Magic Kingdom, compared to $94 last year.
Prices also increased for the other Disney World theme parks -- EPCOT, the Animal Kingdom Park and Hollywood Studios -- to $97 for visitors aged 10 and older, compared to $94 last year. Children aged 3 to 10 now pay $91 for a single-day ticket to those parks, compared to $88 last year.

The price hikes seem to be working for parent company Walt Disney World Resorts, which reported a 7% increase in revenue year-over-year, largely from its parks.

""Increased guest spending was primarily due to higher average ticket prices for admissions at our theme parks,"" Walt Disney Company (DIS) said in a financial report.
A Disney spokeswoman said the ""vast majority"" of visitors buy the multi-day passes, which can knock the price down to $96 per day for a two-day ticket, or $63 per day for a five-day ticket.
She also said that a ticket for a single day at Walt Disney World buys 16 hours of entertainment.

Cook's pay more than doubled last year to $9.2 million, according to a regulatory filing. His salary rose by a quarter to $1.75 million, and his bonus doubled to $6.7 million. Cook also cashed out vacation time he never took, for a total of $56,923. And he received nearly $700,000 in security expenses.
But his paycheck and perks are the least of it.
Also in 2014, $145 million worth of his previously announced stock awards vested. The shares were part of his welcome package when he took over as CEO in 2011.
Cook still has $536 million worth of stock awards from that package that have not yet vested. Cook will receive those shares over the course of the next six years.
Cook's pay package was valued at $378 million when he became Apple's CEO. But shares have risen so sharply over the past three years (mostly in 2014) that his stock awards are now worth $681 million -- an 80% increase.
Cook doesn't yet appear on either the Forbes or Bloomberg billionaire lists. But he may be there soon.
Despite his big payday, Cook was one of the lowest-paid executives at Apple (AAPL, Tech30) last year.
New Apple Store chief Angela Ahrendts got a $73.3 million pay package, most of which came in the form of stock awards that will vest over time. She also received a $412,000 salary and a $1.65 million cash bonus.
Apple gave Ahrendts nearly $800,000 to relocate to the company's Cupertino, California, headquarters. She had lived in London when she was CEO of Burberry (BURBY).
Other highly paid executives included software & services chief Eddy Cue, who made $24.5 million in cash and stock, as well as operations head Jeff Williams, who was paid $24.4 million.
New Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri got paid $14 million, and outgoing CFO Peter Oppenheimer made $4.5 million.
The company's executives were rewarded handsomely because Apple had a banner year.
Apple sold a record number of iPhones and Macs last year, and the company unveiled its plans for the highly anticipated Apple Watch. The company got into the mobile payments business with Apple Pay, and it made its flashiest acquisition in history when it bought Beats Electronics. Though iPad sales are slumping, the iPhone 6 Plus has sold well and represents Apple's answer to the phablet craze.
Bonus targets for the top execs were upped to 200% of executives' salaries (up from 100%) and their maximum bonuses were increased to 400% (up from 200%). Every executive maxxed out his or her bonus.

His email inbox filled up and traffic spiked on the Facebook page he runs for his dog breeding business.
It wasn't until much later in the evening that he connected the dots -- that a four-year-old, 15-inch Beagle named Miss P walked away with the Best in Show title at the 139th Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show around the same time.
""I don't usually watch the dog shows but I flipped to it earlier in the night but actually missed the announcement,"" said Young, who runs Sweet Pea Kennels out of Jackson, Missouri. ""Normally, we don't get calls like that late at night.""
Young, who grew up with a beagle mix whom he said was his ""little girl,"" only started breeding last year. He thinks the win is great for all beagle kind.
""It's amazing how [Westminster] was almost like free advertising for us,"" he said.
Related: Cost of getting a show dog to Westminster
Miss P, who will retire into motherhood after doing a round of talk show interviews about her victory, is the second beagle to ever win the big show. Beagles, the perennial underdog, had never taken home a Best in Show title until 2008, when Uno, Miss. P's great aunt, came out on top.
Beagle breeders across the country saw a similar spike after Uno's win
Scott Bachman, owner of Bachman's Kennel in Hudson, Michigan, was one of them. Last night, at about 11 p.m., he saw the familiar stream of emails coming in from people looking for a beagle pup.
The news thrills him, since he sees beagles as a true dual purpose dog -- perfect for family life and hunting, as they were originally bred to do. He also debunked some of what he called myths about the breed -- that they constantly bark, are stubborn and won't listen.
""I think if people realized what kind of family dogs beagles are, they would be the most popular dogs in the country,"" Bachman said.
Cyndi Tipton of Split Oak Kennels in Jacksonville, Florida, has kept beagles for the last 20 years and has been breeding them for 10. She got three back-to-back calls after Miss P's victory and expects to see more in the coming days. She had a new litter of six beagle puppies earlier this month and she already has about 8 families interested in them.
""They're going really quickly,"" she said, which she loves to hear. ""They can be hardheaded but they put a smile on your face and they're a lot of fun.""
Miss P is probably not surprised by the beaglemania.
In an interview even before her big win, her handler William Alexander said he met Miss P when she was six-months-old and she's been ""[his] princess"" ever since.
""She just thinks she's the best one here."""

And now it's about to take another part of New York by storm: Wall Street.
The upscale burger joint priced its initial public offering at $21 a share Thursday evening. That's above the price range Shake Shack set earlier this week, which it had already raised due to strong demand.
At $21 a share, Shake Shack is raising $105 million, making the company worth $745.5 million.
Shake Shack (SHAK) is set to debut on the New York Stock Exchange Friday morning.
To celebrate its first day as a public company, Shake Shack said it will turn the New York Stock Exchange into the New York SHACK Exchange. In other words, it plans to park a Shake Shack food truck in front of the exchange and dish up free food.
Restaurateur Danny Meyer, who is chairman of Shake Shack and founder of the Union Square Hospitality Group that started Shake Shack, owns a 21% stake in the company. His share is now worth $156.2 million.
Shake Shack, which started in 2001 as a hot dog cart in New York's Madison Square Park, has quickly become a Big Apple icon.
Expanding ... but not too quickly. The company currently operates just 63 restaurants worldwide -- but 16 of them are in the metropolitan New York City area.
And Shake Shack has already planted outposts in several global markets, such as London, Moscow, Kuwait, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates.
Shake Shack has said that it wants to expand relatively slowly. It is targeting 10 new locations in the U.S. a year as well as more international locations.

The strategy has been extremely successful so far. Shake Shack reported revenue of $83.8 million in the first three quarters of last year, an increase of more than 40% from the same period in 2013.
Shake Shack is also profitable. But net income fell in the first nine months of 2014, primarily due to higher costs for paper, food and labor as the company opened more locations.

The proof is in the prices. A typical burger at Shake Shack can cost twice as much as a Big Mac.

To celebrate its first day as a public company, Shake Shack said it will turn the New York Stock Exchange into the New York SHACK Exchange. In other words, it plans to park a Shake Shack food truck in front of the exchange and dish up free food.
Restaurateur Danny Meyer, who is chairman of Shake Shack and founder of the Union Square Hospitality Group that started Shake Shack, owns a 21% stake in the company. His share is now worth $156.2 million.
Shake Shack, which started in 2001 as a hot dog cart in New York's Madison Square Park, has quickly become a Big Apple icon.
Expanding ... but not too quickly. The company currently operates just 63 restaurants worldwide -- but 16 of them are in the metropolitan New York City area.
And Shake Shack has already planted outposts in several global markets, such as London, Moscow, Kuwait, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates.
Shake Shack has said that it wants to expand relatively slowly. It is targeting 10 new locations in the U.S. a year as well as more international locations.

The strategy has been extremely successful so far. Shake Shack reported revenue of $83.8 million in the first three quarters of last year, an increase of more than 40% from the same period in 2013.
Shake Shack is also profitable. But net income fell in the first nine months of 2014, primarily due to higher costs for paper, food and labor as the company opened more locations.
Profiting from the problems at Mickey D's? So will the stock be a big hit? Aren't consumers backing away from unhealthy burgers and fries? McDonald's (MCD) just announced its CEO is retiring after a period of weak sales.
That's true. But Shake Shack and other gourmet burger companies appear to be doing well at the expense of McDonald's.

Shake Shack bills itself as a ""fine casual"" dining chain, a play on the fast casual term popularized by Chipotle (CMG) and Panera (PNRA).
In addition to having the backing of star chef Meyer, Shake Shack says in its IPO filing that it prides itself on using ""sustainable ingredients, such as all-natural, hormone and antibiotic-free beef.""
The proof is in the prices. A typical burger at Shake Shack can cost twice as much as a Big Mac.

Shake Shack also differentiates itself from other burger restaurants by selling hot dogs, beer, wine and -- of course -- frozen custard shakes.
And investors are clearly hungry for restaurant IPOs.
El Pollo Loco (LOCO), Potbelly (PBPB), Noodles (NDLS) and Zoe's Kitchen (ZOES) are just a few chains that have gone public in the past two years that have soared on their first day of trading.
There is a lot of competition in the burger wars. But those four stocks are now well off their highs.
So is Habit (HABT), a popular California burger chain that went public last November and more than doubled in its debut.
Habit may not be as well-known to New Yorkers as Shake Shack. But its burgers were voted best in America by readers of Consumer Reports last year.
To that end, competition could prove to be the biggest risk for Shake Shack.

Even though its burgers are delicious, so are ones made by privately held Five Guys, Smashburger, Bareburger, In-N-Out and many other regional and national upstarts.
Heck, Sonic  (SONC)is doing really well lately thanks to strong demand for its burgers.
So Shake Shack may soar on Friday like other restaurant IPOs have done lately.
But the challenge is going to be staying at those lofty levels. The company now has to satisfy the fickle tastes of Wall Street as well as the palates of hipster burger gourmands.

That's how much food is wasted by consumers every year around the world, according to a new report by U.K. nonprofit Waste & Resources Action Programme.
The vast majority of food is wasted in Asia, followed by Europe and then North America.
The report is based on United Nations estimates that consumers waste 280 million tons of food each year.
To put that in perspective, that food waste could fill the MetLife stadium in New Jersey to the brim 560 times.
The U.K. organization, which calls itself WRAP for short, outlines that tens or even hundreds of billions of dollars in food could be saved if consumers were more careful.
""Practical changes, such as lowering the average temperatures of refrigerators or designing better packaging, can make a considerable difference in preventing spoilage,"" the organization said in a press release.
WRAP estimates that one-quarter of food waste in the developing world could be eliminated with better refrigeration equipment.
But this problem goes well beyond consumer carelessness. Veggies rot on the fields and food can become damaged during processing and distribution.
The UN estimates that 415 million tons of food is wasted at the agriculture level every year and 600 million tons is wasted after harvest, before it reaches consumers."
2015-02-20 07:54:56,"No dogs allowed: San Francisco's pet housing crisis - Feb. 20, 2015 ",http://money.cnn.com/2015/02/20/real_estate/pets-san-francisco/index.html,"The housing crunch in San Francisco isn't just forcing out lower income renters, it's forcing out Fido, too.
According to San Francisco animal welfare nonprofit SF SPCA, there's been a surge in owners abandoning their pets due to an inability to find pet-friendly housing.
Over the last year, one in four people who left pets with the organization cited problems finding pet-friendly housing. The organization started tracking the numbers this year after staff noticed that housing issues were becoming an increasingly common problem, according to spokesperson Krista Maloney.
An influx of highly-paid tech workers in recent years have pushed out many low- and middle-income renters and driven rents higher. With limited space to build on and tight regulations, the short supply of housing in the city has only made matters worse.
Competition for each apartment is so fierce that landlords can afford to be more selective about tenants, said Mark Campana, president of Anchor Realty, which does not allow pets in any of its roughly 1,000 units.
Related: 10 least affordable rental markets
""Now with the market moving with great speed and with vacant units in high demand, an owner doesn't have the incentive to be pet-friendly,"" said Campana.
Michael Harrington, president of Pacific Union Property Management, said that while some landlords may be flexible about allowing small dogs, they know they can always find another tenant without an animal.
""We're definitely in what I would call a landlord's market,"" said Harrington.
Just because a unit is advertised as pet-friendly doesn't mean it will go to a pet owner, said Dr. Emily Weiss, vice president of research and development at ASPCA.
That might explain why data from online rental listing company, Lovely, showed that the percentage of listings that said they allowed ""some pets"" actually grew from 34% to 39% between 2012 and 2014.
Pet-friendly options also tend to be more out of reach for low-income renters, said Weiss. According to a recent analysis of listings by HotPads, pet-friendly units in San Francisco cost an average of 12% more than those that don't allow pets. That's compared to a national average of 3.5% in major metro areas, the company found. And that doesn't include pet deposits or additional ""pet rent,"" which may be required on top of normal rent.
San Francisco even lags behind New York City, where the share of dog-friendly apartments is almost three times higher and just over half of all landlords allow ""some pets,"" according to Lovely. Yet, pet ownership in the city has long faced the same challenges that the SPCA is seeing in San Francisco, said Sandra DeFeo, executive director of the Humane Society of New York.
""People with more means tend to find places that will accept them with pets,"" she said.
Jackie Tom, president of leasing company RentalsinSF, said it was hard enough finding an apartment that would accept her Great Dane 15 years ago. Today, the market is even more stressful and more expensive for pet owners, she said.
""There are a lot of wonderful pet owners and not enough affordable housing for them,"" said Tom, who manages 35 pet-friendly units in the city. ""They can keep their pets, but there is a price.""
Related: 'Why I have a roommate at my age'
Eric Andresen, president of the San Francisco Apartment Association and Viking Services Corp., which manages about 2,300 housing units in the area, said he would be surprised if the housing crunch really made the city less pet-friendly overall.
He notes that many residents have learned to skirt landlords' pet restrictions by claiming their pets as assistance animals, abusing laws meant to help people with disabilities. The problem has become so widespread in recent years that Andresen recommends landlords simply allow pets so they have some control over the animals in their buildings.
""Then at least you can protect yourself with a pet deposit,"" said Andresen. ""And it certainly puts your relationship with your tenant in a more cooperative place."""

NBC announced on Monday that the Patriots 28-24 last second victory over the Seattle Seahawks drew an average audience of 114.4 million viewers.
This makes Super Bowl XLIX the most watched broadcast in U.S. TV history.
Sunday's total was up from last year's 112.2 million viewers -- the largest recorded TV audience at the time.
It's important to note, however, that Nielsen doesn't account for groups at sports bars or viewing parties, so Sunday's numbers could even be more massive.
The game peaked at 120.8 million viewers during its final minutes when the Patriots literally snatched away victory from the Seahawks.
This record audience is obviously a big win for the Peacock network and the NFL, but it's also a victory for many of the game's sponsors like McDonald's (MCD) and Budweiser (AHBIF) who shelled out $4.5 million per 30-second ad for the game.
""Super Bowl XLIX delivered for all of our partners, proving once again that the Super Bowl is the most dominant and consistent property on television,"" Mark Lazarus, chairman of NBC Sports, said in a statement.
Katy Perry and her dancing costumed sharks also took a bite out of the history books Sunday night with a record audience for the performer's halftime show.
Perry's colorful pyrotechnic extravaganza hauled in 118.5 million viewers making it the most watched halftime show in the Super Bowl's 49 year history.
NBC also had a big night on the digital side of the things, with its live stream of the game bringing in a ton of viewers.
More than 1.3 million people watched the Super Bowl through NBC's web stream of the game during the final moments when Patriots' Malcolm Bulter intercepted a pass from Seattle on the goal line to seal the win.
Even though the Seahawks came up short, the team's fans still watched in droves.
According to ESPN's Sports Business Reporter Darren Rovell, 89% of the TVs on in Seattle during the game were tuned into the Super Bowl.
Super Bowl XLIX was a huge hit on social media too.
Over 28.4 million tweets related to the game and halftime show were sent during the live telecast.
This made it the most tweeted Super Bowl ever.
The game also gave a boost to networks that didn't even broadcast it, like ESPN and the NFL Network.
ESPN aired 346 hours of NFL programming during Super Bowl Week across its networks, and in a press release on Monday it said people spent a total of 7 billion minutes viewing the coverage.
""That correlates to 13,628 years of television viewing,"" the network said."

The books have been dubbed ""mommy porn"" by some, and the movie opening on Valentine's Day promises to be nearly as racy.
There is no shortage of marketing opportunities. On the more tame end of the spectrum, Vermont Teddy Bears is peddling a Christian Grey bear, donning a suit and carrying mini handcuffs and a blindfold. The website boasts that the plush gift will help you ""dominate Valentine's Day.""

And Target (TGT) is selling Fifty Shades-branded adult toys. (Now the big-box retailer really does carry everything.)
It has a Fifty Shades ""Massage Me"" candle, ""No Peeking"" blindfolds, as well as bath and massage oils. On the more R-rated end of things, the store is also carrying lubricant and even a vibrating love ring. (No, that's not for your finger.)
The items can be found in what Target calls the ""adult health area"" of the store, according to a spokeswoman.

Fashion retailer Hot Topic sells tights with the Christian Grey's signature sign off ""Laters, baby,"" written on them. And on Etsy, you can find plenty of t-shirts that say things like ""Property of Mr. Grey.""
Anyone who has read the books knows that these items hardly come close to the more risque toys featured in the story. The UK-based online sex shop Lovehoney has the exclusive rights to the Fifty Shades of Grey Official Pleasure Collection, which was approved by the author E.L. James herself.

On Sunday morning the website announced that its editor in chief, Ben Smith, will sit down with President Obama at the White House on Tuesday. Obama will also take part in a video shoot.
BuzzFeed is using Facebook to amplify the interview, first by having Smith invite users' questions for the president ahead of time and then by posting the Obama video on Facebook afterward.
The video is being produced by the site's relatively new video production division, called BuzzFeed Motion Pictures. It's intended to be funny and appealing to young people.
The combination -- a news interview and an entertaining video -- is akin to Obama showing up on ABC's evening newscast with David Muir and ABC's late-night talk show with Jimmy Kimmel on the same day.
It's a coup whenever any news outlet winds up with an interview with the president because it elevates the outlet and the individual interviewer.
For BuzzFeed, it's especially significant, given the site's beginnings as an entertaining source of viral videos, photos and listicles. The site still has plenty of that, but it also employs more than 200 journalists in its news division, called BuzzFeed News.
""It's a real moment for us,"" said a BuzzFeed spokesperson. ""Not only will the President talk to Ben, he will also be part of a video shoot which you can expect to be the kind of fun, playful video you're accustomed to seeing from BuzzFeed Motion Pictures.""

It is also another example of the Obama administration's effort to seek nontraditional forums for the president to get out his messages.
Obama, of course, has granted many television Q&As over the years -- CNN's Fareed Zakaria televised an interview with him last Sunday. But he has also taken questions from Facebook users, YouTube stars and comedians.
Dan Pfeiffer, an outgoing senior adviser to the president who has spearheaded this press strategy, said the White House has tried to reflect a swiftly changing media environment.
""We don't have an either/or strategy, we have an and-both strategy,"" he said in an interview for CNN's ""Reliable Sources"" in December. ""So we're going to do 'Meet The Press with Chuck Todd,' 'The Lead with Jake Tapper,' but we're also going to do 'Between Two Ferns.'""

2015-02-04 06:12:32,"NBC's Brian Williams recants Iraq attack story - Feb. 4, 2015 ",http://money.cnn.com/2015/02/04/media/brian-williams-recants-iraq-story/index.html,"It was a dramatic account from the early stage of the Iraq War, one that placed NBC News anchor Brian Williams aboard a U.S. military helicopter that had drawn enemy fire. The story was told repeatedly by Williams and NBC.
And it wasn't true.
Williams, the anchor of the ""NBC Nightly News,"" apologized on Wednesday for claiming -- as recently as last Friday -- that he'd been on a helicopter that was ""forced down after being hit by an RPG.""
The incident happened on March 24, 2003. A Chinook helicopter was forced down by enemy fire. But Williams was not aboard.
Stars and Stripes reported on Wednesday that ""Williams arrived in the area about an hour later on another helicopter,"" one that ""took no fire and landed later beside the damaged helicopter due to an impending sandstorm from the Iraqi desert.""
Williams is blaming a foggy memory.
""I made a mistake in recalling the events of 12 years ago,"" he said on Wednesday's ""Nightly News,"" specifically addressing his false comments from last Friday.
But he did not address any of the past occasions when he apparently misspoke about the RPG attack.
Related: How Brian Williams' Iraq story changed
In a 2013 appearance on David Letterman's talk show, for instance, Williams said ""two of the four helicopters were hit, by ground fire, including the one I was in, RPG and AK-47.""

The damaging revelations may harm Williams' credibility. Media critics and Internet commenters immediately expressed doubt that Williams could have innocently misremembered what had happened on the reporting trip.
NBC declined to comment on Wednesday night.
Williams was embedded with U.S. military forces on risky missions at the start of the Iraq War in 2003. A USA Today report at the time said he was ""stranded in the Iraqi desert for three days after a Chinook helicopter ahead of his was attacked by a man who fired a rocket-propelled grenade.""
USA Today said ""the grenade just missed, but it forced the group to make an emergency landing.""
A few days later, Williams said this on NBC: ""Suddenly, without knowing why, we learned we've been ordered to land in the desert. On the ground, we learn the Chinook ahead of us was almost blown out of the sky.""
The story evolved over time. And last week Williams briefly retold it on the ""NBC Nightly News,"" which he has anchored since 2004. It was part of an on-air tribute to a soldier who provided security for the downed crew.
""The helicopter we were traveling in was forced down after being hit by an RPG,"" Williams said on the broadcast. ""Our traveling NBC News team was rescued and kept alive by an Armored Mechanized Platoon from the U.S. Army 3rd Infantry.""
After the tribute aired and NBC shared it on Facebook, people started to raise questions about its veracity.
Lance Reynolds, who was quoted in news accounts about the March 24, 2003 incident, wrote on Facebook, ""Sorry dude, I don't remember you being on my aircraft.""
Reynolds continued, ""I do remember you walking up about an hour after we had landed to ask me what had happened. Then I remember you guys taking back off in a different flight of Chinooks from another unit and heading to Kuwait to report your 'war story' to the Nightly News. The whole time we were still stuck in Iraq trying to repair the aircraft and pulling our own Security.""
Another commenter, Joseph Miller, wrote, ""Thank you Lance! I've been calling him out on this for a long time with no response. He was actually on my aircraft and we came in behind you about 30-45 minutes later.""
Some of the comments insulted Williams and called him a liar. He responded in a Facebook post on Wednesday afternoon.
""You are absolutely right and I was wrong,"" he wrote to Reynolds, Miller and several others.
""In fact, I spent much of the weekend thinking I'd gone crazy,"" he wrote. ""I feel terrible about making this mistake.""
William said he has ""no desire to fictionalize my experience (we all saw it happened the first time) and no need to dramatize events as they actually happened, I think the constant viewing of the video showing us inspecting the impact area -- and the fog of memory over 12 years -- made me conflate the two, and I apologize.""
The anchor did not go into that much detail on Wednesday's ""Nightly News.""
He said ""I want to apologize -- I said I was traveling in an aircraft that was hit by RPG fire. I was instead in a following aircraft. We all landed after the ground fire incident and spent 2 harrowing nights in a sandstorm in the Iraq desert.""
""This was a bungled attempt by me to thank one special veteran, and by extension, our brave military men and women, veterans everywhere, those who have served while I did not,"" he added. ""I hope they know they have my greatest respect, and also now my apology."""
2015-02-08 08:56:00,"Russia: How long until the economy cracks? - Feb. 8, 2015 ",http://money.cnn.com/2015/02/08/news/economy/russia-economy/index.html,"Russia is skating on thin ice: Cheap oil, Western sanctions and years of mismanagement have sent its economy into a deep freeze.
Now everyone is wondering when the ice will crack.
As things stand, Russian GDP is expected to shrink by 5% (or more) this year, inflation has soared to 15%, the ruble is trading near record lows, consumer and business sentiment is on the slide, and its companies are shut out of financial markets in the U.S. and Europe.
Escalating violence in Ukraine could lead to new international sanctions, and there's little sign of a significant rebound in world oil prices.
So just how long can Russia avoid complete economic meltdown?
Much will depend on how fast it burns through its remaining stash of foreign currency. Last year it spent $134 billion trying to prop up the ruble, bail out struggling companies and contain the crisis.
That splurge cut its international reserves to about $376 billion, more than enough to finance a year of imports if necessary, but the lowest level since the depths of the global financial crisis in March 2009.
Russia needs reserves for imports, but also to service $600 billion worth of foreign debt -- most of it held by Russian companies and banks.
Depending on who you ask, the crunch could come by the end of this year, or it could hold out for another 12 months beyond that.
Philip Uglow, chief economist at MNI Indicators, says Russian reserves could sink to a critical level six months from now, though the first half of 2016 is more likely.
""Countries under pressure can burn through reserves very quickly,"" he said. ""It could be staring down the barrel of default, much like in 1998, sooner than expected.""
Other experts think Russia's cash buffer could keep the nation afloat for another two years, even if oil prices stay at current levels and the conflict in Ukraine drags on.
Related: Kalashnikov's business keeps booming
Then again, no one can predict the future. And if oil prices surge back this year, some of Russia's economic problems will fade.
""With so many moving parts, coming to a view as to how long reserves might last for is almost impossible,"" wrote Neil Shearing, chief emerging markets economist at Capital Economics."

Dodge said the dealers are possibly doing something unethical and illegal.
The car company said a ""small number"" of dealers are taking multiple deposits for the 2015 Dodge Challenger and Charger SRT Hellcat models, even though their customers might have to wait months for their cars, if they get them at all.
""An isolated number of dealers have taken a far greater number of orders than they could reasonably expect to fulfill under the ...allocation system,"" said a statement from Dodge, a unit of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCAM).

Challenger sales are up 60% the first two months of this year, while Charger sales are up 23%. But Dodge won't say how many of the Challengers and Chargers it is selling are the sought-after Hellcat models."

The season three episodes (which ""House of Cards"" calls chapters) were ironically placed under a banner on the site that read ""Watch Season 3 on February 27.""

2015-02-12 06:03:51,"What else has NBC News dug up on Brian Williams? - Feb. 12, 2015 ",http://money.cnn.com/2015/02/12/media/brian-williams-investigation-questions/index.html,"Brian Williams' future at NBC News may hinge on just how many other examples of exaggerations and fibs are found.
The network's internal fact-checking investigation is ""nowhere near done,"" a senior NBC source said Thursday.
It has widened beyond just Williams' initial errors about a 2003 Iraq War mission to include other possible misstatements, but the network has not commented on any particular ones.
When he apologized last week for his on-air error about the Iraq mission, he chalked it up to innocent ""misremembering."" But others have implied something more malicious.
On Thursday The Huffington Post identified questions about Williams' claims of flying into Baghdad with SEAL Team 6 and about ""war memorabilia the anchor claims to have received as gifts, including a Navy SEAL's knife and a piece of the helicopter from the raid that killed Osama bin Laden.""
CNN analyst Peter Bergen said on ""Anderson Cooper 360"" that he was told by sources in the Seal community that it would be impossible for Williams to have ever traveled with Seal Team 6.
""We do not embed journalists with any elements of that unit ... bottom line -- no,"" one Special Operations Command official said.
In the case of the memorabilia that Williams says he received from ""his friends"" in the Seal community: ""that doesn't pass any sniff test,"" another Seal officer told Bergen.
A spokeswoman for NBC News declined to comment.
Williams' exaggerations about Iraq and subsequent questions about his accounts of Hurricane Katrina have triggered a full-blown crisis of confidence inside NBC News. (The scrutiny about Katrina is particularly significant.) Williams was suspended on Tuesday for six months without pay, and may never return to his ""NBC Nightly News"" anchor chair.
The suspension had an ominous feel to it -- a sense, expressed by many media analysts, that there are more examples out there of the anchor embellishing the truth.
""We have concerns about comments that occurred outside NBC News while Brian was talking about his experiences in the field,"" NBC News president Deborah Turness said in announcing the suspension.
Media accounts have concentrated more on Williams' misstatements than the apparent lack of executive oversight. (His appearances on late-night shows, for example, were set up by public relations people and supported by NBC management.)
Meanwhile, Williams -- who is bound by the terms of his contract -- isn't allowed to speak without the network's approval, and the network isn't giving him that approval right now.
As NBC's fact-checking continues, two accounts from Williams' younger days could also invite scrutiny.
As a reporter for WCBS-TV in New York in 1989, Williams traveled to Berlin to cover the demolition of the Berlin Wall. The assignment has become an omnipresent line in his various biographies, and Williams himself has identified it as a career highlight.
""I've been so fortunate,"" he said during a 2008 forum at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library. ""I was at the Brandenburg Gate the night the wall came down.""
Williams did indeed witness some of the wall's physical removal. But ""the night the wall came down"" is widely recognized as November 9, 1989, an iconic date with particular significance to Williams' ""Nightly News"" predecessor Tom Brokaw.
Brokaw was famously the only American anchorman to report live from the scene on that historic day, an accomplishment that NBC News has proudly trumpeted for years. It was a defining moment for Brokaw.
And Williams has, to be sure, consistently credited Brokaw and NBC for having a jump on the story. In a 2004 interview, Williams said he ""arrived at the Berlin Wall a day after -- more like 12 hours after -- Tom Brokaw did.""
""But I got there, and I have my own piece of the wall, my own piece of that memory that I'll always hold tight to,"" he added.
Other times, Williams has arguably conflated his experience with that of Brokaw's.
""Here's a fact: 25 years ago tonight, Tom Brokaw and I were at the Berlin Wall,"" Williams said at a gala held on November 8, 2014.
At the same event, where Brokaw was honored by the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation, Williams cracked that he was ""very pissed off 'cause Tom had arrived [in Berlin] first"" while ""everyone else in journalism"" was racing to catch a flight from New York to Berlin.
""So by the second night of the story, we were all there,"" Williams added.
An NBC News source in a position to know confirmed to CNNMoney that ""Brian arrived the day after the wall came down.""
In public settings, Williams has also discussed another brush with history that occurred a decade before the fall of the Berlin Wall. As a student at Catholic University, Williams was at the school when Pope John Paul II spoke at the Washington, D.C. campus in 1979. The anchor's account of the papal visit has varied over the years.
In 2002, Williams was quoted as saying that he chipped in with the school's preparations as an employee in the campus public relations office.
""I was there during the visit of the pope,"" Williams said.
If he had any interaction with the pope, Williams didn't mention it then. But that changed in 2004, a year before the death of Pope John Paul II. While delivering the commencement address at Catholic University that year, Williams said the ""highlight"" of his time at the school ""was in this very doorway, shaking hands with the Holy Father during his visit to this campus.""
After reporting the news of the pope's death in 2005, Williams said on-air that he was ""thinking back to the first time I met him at Catholic University, I guess it's 25 years ago now.""
Days later, Williams provided a more colorful version of his meeting.
""I have to begin with a beautiful day in 1979,"" Williams said in an interview published by NBC News. ""I was a student at Catholic University, and over the course of two hours, chatted up a Secret Service agent who spilled like a cup of coffee and told me that the pope would be coming our way, straight up the steps of a side door at the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception. I positioned myself and held out my hand and said, 'Welcome to Catholic University, Holy Father.' And he embraced my hand with both of his, made the sign of the cross, and said a blessing to me.""
The same year, he told Esquire he met the pope simply by being in the right place at the right time -- not thanks to a chatty Secret Service agent.
The holes in these accounts may seem small. Up until a week ago, most people wouldn't have given them a second thought. That they're even getting brought up speaks to the depth of this calamity.
Representatives for NBC News repeatedly declined to comment on the stories.
The head of NBC's in-house investigation is Richard Esposito, the senior executive producer of the news division's investigative unit. The general counsel of NBC's parent company, NBCUniversal, is also involved.
Many media critics have raised eyebrows about NBC's decision to appoint one of its own investigative producers, rather than an outsider, to look into Williams' claims.
At one point early in the process, Esposito provided his bosses with the names of several other people who could conduct an external investigation, according to two people with knowledge of the discussions.
An NBC executive, speaking anonymously, said these names were meant to be recommendations in case the probe expanded and required additional resources.
On Thursday another NBC source said a third-party investigator may, in fact, become involved, but that no final decisions have been made.
Brian Stelter contributed reporting.

2015-02-04 02:15:02,"Apple's timing on bonds: Perfect - Feb. 4, 2015 ",http://money.cnn.com/2015/02/04/investing/apple-bond-timing/index.html,"Here's another thing Apple excels at: market timing.
The tech giant raised $6.5 billion Monday by selling its bonds on Wall Street. It's a huge sum for any company, but the move is especially notable because Monday was the day interest rates on U.S. bonds hit rock bottom -- the lowest level since May 2013.
Apple's finance team might as well belong to the genius bar given the company is paying interest rates as low as 1.55% on its 5-year bond.
""Very few companies can come to market so quickly and get big bond deals like this done so seamlessly,"" says Marilyn Cohen, CEO of Envision Capital Management, which specializes in bonds. ""People are confident in Apple (AAPL, Tech30) as both a stock play and bond play.""
The stock hit a new all-time high Wednesday.
Related: Investing in Apple is a 'no brainer'
Investors who bought Apple's 30-year bond will be paid an annual interest rate of 3.45%. That's a lot lower than the rate many home buyers can get on a 30-year fixed mortgage.
Apple declined to comment, but Cohen notes that Apple is clearly watching interest rates closely and knows when to strike and get what amounts to ""almost free money.""
This isn't the first time Apple has had such astute timing in the bond market. The company pulled off what was then the biggest corporate bond issue ever in April 2013. At that point, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note -- the key benchmark against which many interest rates are priced -- was below 1.7%.
""They very nearly nailed the top of the bond market then,"" says Tim Anderson, managing director of MND Partners. He points out that rates haven't gotten back to those low April 2013 levels... until just the past few days.
Related: Stocks plunge, but bonds are still red hot
Overall, Apple has tapped the bond market frequently. It has raised $39 billion in the bond market just in the past two years.
The company isn't hurting for money. It has a mind boggling $178 billion of cash on hand already, but most of that is held overseas. One of the big tax debates in Washington is how much tax Apple should have to pay when it brings that money back to America.
For now, the cheap bond market is allowing Apple -- and other companies such as Netflix (NFLX, Tech30) that also raised money via a big bond issue this week -- to raise money without having to tap its overseas reserves.
Apple initially planned to only raise about $5 billion, but there was so much demand Monday that the company raised the amount.
Billionaire hedge fund manger Carl Icahn told CNNMoney recently that investing in Apple is a ""no brainer,"" but he has been pushing the company to use some of its cash to buy back more stock.
""Carl is probably dancing a jig right now,"" Cohen says.

2015-02-13 12:19:16,"The View-Master is back. Now it's virtual reality for kids. - Feb. 13, 2015 ",http://money.cnn.com/2015/02/13/technology/view-master-virtual-reality/index.html,"Remember the View-Master? That classic toy is getting a virtual reality reboot.
This fall, Google (GOOG) and Mattel (MAT) are coming out with a plastic viewer that pairs up with your smartphone. You can explore virtual reality environments, make three-dimensional dinosaurs appear in the real world or -- in classic fashion -- transport yourself to faraway places and historical monuments.
Unlike the old View-Master's static images, you can spin around in place and see everything around you.
It'll work with every smartphone and cost $30, the companies said. They unveiled it in New York City on Friday.
The new View-Master is basically a polished version of Google Cardboard. A downloadable app does all the magic, splitting your phone screen into two images that, when viewed together, create the 3-D effect. The viewer is just a comfortable way to hold the phone up to your eyes. A magnetic button on the side lets you cycle through images or interact with your environment.
You can click on an item and learn more about it. Mattel is also dusting off old stereoscopic images from its vast library, so you can see the Golden Gate bridge today -- and back when it was just constructed in the 1940s.
I tried out an early version of the product and traveled to San Francisco, the surface of the Moon, and I had a 3-D dinosaur sit on the palm of my hand and dunk its head into a raspberry.

Mattel is on a mission to keep its product line relevant to today's technological world, so expect brands like Barbie, Hot Wheels, and Thomas to get digital treatment too someday. Mattel executives wouldn't say what's next, but a fully explorable Barbie house and the experience of driving inside a blazing orange Hot Wheels race track are a natural fit, they said.
Mattel isn't totally ditching the classic View-Master product design, though. The old version relied on thin, cardboard disks called ""reels"" that featured pairs of stereoscopic images on transparent film. In this new model, disks still carry content. But you don't slip them into the viewer. Instead, you point your viewer at them, scan a unique design (like a QR code), and 3-D images pop up.
Select the floating images, and the software in the phone transports you to wherever you're going.
Mattel expects to sell the disks in $15 packs of four. Mattel brand executive Douglas Wadleigh said the company is betting on nostalgia and an appetite for collectibles.
But the device can work without reels and rely solely on app stores online.
Like its predecessor -- which was popular with children in the 1960s, 70s and 80s -- this View-Master is geared toward family use. Small adjusters inside the device will fit any parent's smartphone. And the app is meant to be used without full Internet access.
But is it healthy for children to stare at virtual reality screens two inches from their eyeballs? Mattel said the product has received approval from a team of pediatric ophthalmologists at St. Louis University. And the toy is recommended for children ages seven and older.
Besides, this View-Master isn't meant to be used very long anyway.
""We made it without a strap. We don't expect them to zone out for hours on end,"" said Mike Jazayeri, Google Cardboard's product director.

The U.S.-made gun will have same name as the original: AK-47, arguably the most ubiquitous assault rifle in the world.
The gun will be made by American company RWC, which is the official importer and distributor of Kalashnikov AK-47s. The company had to stop importing the guns after the U.S. imposed sanctions in July against Russia for its role in the Ukraine crisis.
RWC said it is not permitted to have any contact with the Russian company, Kalashnikov Concern, which makes the AK-47s.
""We are not permitted to pick up the phone and to talk to them,"" said Thomas McCrossin, CEO of RWC, which owns the Kalashnikov USA brand. ""We were forced to stop doing business with them because of the sanctions.""
RWC, based in Tullytown, Pa., has the rights to the AK-47 Kalashnikov brand of guns, which has been produced in the Soviet Union after World War II.
It is arguably one of the most famous firearm brands in the world. The original AK-47s are made by the 200-year-old Russian company, but it is one of the most copied assault rifles in the world with knock-offs made all over the globe, including China, Europe and the U.S.
Related: AK-47s become hot commodity after U.S. sanctions
Demand for Ak-47s -- already very high in the U.S. -- has surged after the sanctions.
For now, the company has enough guns to meet the demand.
""I have a lot of inventory on my shelf bought and paid for,"" McCrossin told CNNMoney in Las Vegas at the annual gun industry show. ""We are permitted to sell these weapons because they were already in the U.S. But when the inventory goes down to zero, there are no more.""
McCrossin plans to change that with a new factory that will make the first AK-47s in the U.S.
""In the second quarter of this year we are going to start manufacturing here in the U.S.,"" said McCrossin. ""What I'm manufacturing are our own AK-47s and shotguns under the Kalashnikov brand.""

CNNMoney has reached out to Kalashnikov Concern in Moscow for comment, but hasn't heard back.
McCrossin said he's shopping around for a location for the factory. He said that he plans to hire people, but he wouldn't say how many.
He made the announcement at the Kalashnikov USA booth at the SHOT Show. The booth carried the slogans ""Russian heritage"" and ""Made in USA."""

That's a 7% jump from 2013, according to the 2014 ""Billionaire Census"" from Wealth-X and UBS.
So who is your standard billionaire? According to the report, the typical billionaire has about $3.1 billion, is 63 years old, and did not reach the $1 billion threshold until their late 40s.
Almost 90% of them are married, and on average, have two kids a piece.
They like to hang with other billionaires: They have relationships with nine ultra-high net worth individuals, three of whom are billionaires.
They're mostly male: Just 286 of them are women.
They're self-made: About 60% of male billionaires fully made their fortunes themselves, and another 27% have at least partly made their money themselves. Though it's a different story for the women -- just 17% are self-made. More than 65% of women billionaires inherited their wealth.
They own a lot of stuff: The typical billionaire owns four properties, each worth an average of $23.5 million. About 35% of billionaires have their own private philanthropic foundations, and one in thirty billionaires owns a sports team or a race horse.
Education isn't required: Not all billionaires have a wall full of degrees. In fact, the report states that 35% of global billionaires do not have bachelor's degrees.
For those who did go to college, University of Pennsylvania tops the list of schools with most billionaire undergraduate alumni.
Unsurprisingly, Harvard, Yale and University of Southern California follow, but University of Mumbai and Moscow State University aren't far behind. However, 16 of the top 20 are in the United States.
And where do they live?: Nearly 35% of the world's billionaires are concentrated in 20 cities, only two of which are in the United States. Despite that, the U.S. has the highest number of billionaires, accounting for close to 25% of the world's total billionaire population.

This year alone, there were 57 new American billionaires.

Olbermann, who has been critical of Penn State in the past, responded by finishing the phrase with ""...Pitiful.""
The original tweet, however, also included a link to a Penn State student newspaper story about the school raising $13 million in support of children and their families fighting pediatric cancer at the Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center.
Penn State supporters chimed in and went after Olbermann: ""So you have no opinion on Penn State raising over $13 million for pediatric cancer research?"" one tweet read.
Olbermann didn't back down. ""Good for you,"" he responded. ""Doesn't change the school's reputation. Check back next century.""

Oil and gas drilling companies lost Â£5.3 billion on their North Sea operations in 2014, the worst losses in four decades, according to a new report.
The annual survey conducted by Oil & Gas UK, which represents Britain's offshore energy industry, painted a bleak picture of the future of North Sea drilling.
New investment in the region will fall by about one third in 2015 as companies are forced to slash costs. The slump could bring the industry to its knees.
""Without sustained investment in new and existing fields, critical infrastructure will disappear, taking with it important North Sea hubs,"" said Malcolm Webb, chief executive of Oil & Gas UK.
Interactive: World's Top Oil Producers
Oil prices slumped from around $110 per barrel to $50 per barrel in just over six month last year. At that price, one third of North Sea oil fields are making losses.
The report said North Sea oil and gas revenues slumped to Â£24.4 billion in 2014, the lowest since 1998.
Only 14 out of 25 wells planned for 2014 were actually drilled, and only between eight and 13 are planned for 2015.
Webb said the dire outlook could mean some areas could become completely unsustainable, leaving oil and gas in the ground. He estimated the industry needs to cut costs by around 40% in order to become viable.
BP (BP) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA), both big producers in the region, have called on the British government to cut taxes on production to ease the pain.
Despite the plunging prices, OPEC's power players are resisting calls to cut production.

Those are just a few of the expenses detailed in recent court filings related to the divorce proceedings of hedge fund billionaire Kenneth Griffin and his wife Anne Dias Griffin. The ongoing contentious split has provided a peek into the private life of the wealthy couple.
Dias Griffin has claimed expenses of nearly $1 million per month, saying that's how much she needs to support the couple's three young children, who are all under 10 and have four nannies. The couple has been married since 2003.
Her husband contends that the budget includes ""exorbitant expenses"" that aren't for the children, but rather to fund his wife's extravagant lifestyle.

The budget includes $300,000 a month for a private jet, $160,000 for vacation accommodations, $60,000 for an office space and professional staff, as well as $14,000 per month for groceries and dining out, according to court filings.

""Anne failed in her initial effort to obtain these things from Ken in the name of maintaining the 'status quo,'"" the filing says, ""Now she claims that these same expenses are in fact 'child support.'""
The filing states that Griffin has paid for 100% of the children's needs, except for ""her astronomical demand for $450,000 to take a ten-day vacation to St. Barth's during the winter break."" He claimed he gave her $45,000 instead.
But a spokesperson for Dias Griffin says she wasn't actually asking for $450,000. ""The only thing Anne has done is to state what Ken's historic spending was for their children during the marriage and what it would cost to replicate that, as required by Illinois law.""

""Ken Griffin, one of the wealthiest men in the world, continues to lie with impunity and to brutally and shamelessly attack the mother of his children in an effort to avoid his financial responsibilities to his family,"" Dias Griffin's spokesperson said.

It's worth about $12,000.
Well, that's what it would be worth if it were owned by you or me. But since it was owned and driven by Buffett -- and even has his signature scrawled above the glove compartment -- it is expected to sell for considerably more.
The last car Buffett sold off, a Lincoln Town Car, went for $70,000 in 2006, or roughly three times its ordinary value.
This time, Buffett is auctioning a beige 2006 Cadillac DTS. The DTS is a roomy, comfortable front-wheel drive car powered by a 275-horsepower V8 engine.
Proceeds from the sale will go to Girls Incorporated of Omaha, a local chapter of the national group formerly known as the Girls Club of America. Buffett's first wife, Susan, who passed away in 2004, was among the founders of the Omaha Girls Club chapter. The auction will run online February 11-18 at www.proxibid.com/girlsinc.
The car is a ""cream puff,"" Buffett told CNNMoney in a phone interview.
""If I were a used car salesman, this would be a cinch for me to sell,"" he said.
The Cadillac, with only 20,000 miles on it, has leather in the interior with heated and cooled power seats, automatically dimming side mirrors, a parking sensor system and it is equipped for satellite radio.
Buffett said he was unaware of which equipment in the car was optional because, as usual, he had his daughter, Susie, buy it for him and he gave her no specific instructions.
""If there are options, it's because of her,"" he said.
Nothing particularly memorable ever happened in the car, Buffett said.
""If I was 16 or 17 I would have had a few memorable moments it the car,"" he said in jest.
No momentous business deals were done in it, either, save one. General Motors CEO Mary Barra sold him a new Cadillac while the two were riding together in the DTS.
""I said 'Does the new Cadillac have anything this one doesn't?'"" Buffett recalled. ""And we were driving to lunch downtown so she only had 8 minutes and she sold me a new car!""
Related: Buffett bought a new Cadillac XTS
Last year, an opportunity to have lunch with Buffett was auctioned for $2.2 million and the money went to benefit The Glide Foundation, a San Francisco anti-poverty group.
Presumably, though, someone bidding on a meal with Buffett would be hoping for a side dish of investing advice. In this case, the winning bidder will only get a car Buffett used to drive and which isn't likely to make them rich.
This is about Warren Buffett, the celebrity and some celebrity names do add enormous value to a car. Probably the strongest example of that is the actor Steve McQueen. Cars and motorcycles he owned often sell for many times their ordinary value.
But besides celebrity, Buffett's car is being auctioned for charity, and a charity connection usually drives bidders to offer much more money than they would otherwise.

Nissan (NSANF) has created a special glow-in-the-dark Leaf to advertise the benefits of charging the electric car from solar panels.
The luminescent car is covered in a special paint that absorbs energy from the sun during the day and emits a blue glow for up to 10 hours at night. It was created by Nissan in Europe by spraying the car with a special glow-in-the-dark coating.
Glow-in-the-dark car coatings of various types are readily available and have been put on cars before, although Nissan claims it is the first automaker to do so. The paint used on this car, which contains a substance called strontium aluminate, was made especially for Nissan using organic materials. It is biologically inert and cannot harm the environment, according to Nissan.
If it were made available the public, the paint would last for 25 years, Nissan said.

The purpose of the car, Nissan said, is to promote the potential for charging the Nissan Leaf at home using solar panels. If government incentives are used to help pay for the solar panels, the car can be charged virtually free of cost, according to Nissan.
Nissan has put some interesting paint on Leaf electric cars before. Recently, it created a Leaf with mess-resistant paint that would almost never need cleaning because dirt, mud -- and other substances -- won't stick to it.

Sometimes, it's because a participating hospital relies on out-of-network doctors, including emergency room physicians, anesthesiologists and radiologists.
Consumer advocates say the sheer scope of such problems undermine promises made by proponents of the Affordable Care Act that the law would protect against medical bankruptcy.
""It's not fair and probably not legal that consumers be left holding the bag when an out-of-network doctor treats them,"" said Timothy Jost, a law professor at Washington and Lee University.
Adding insult to injury, insurers are not required to count out-of-network charges toward Obamacare's annual limit on out-of-pocket expenses.
Efforts by doctors, hospitals and other health providers to charge patients for bills not covered by their insurers are called ""balance billing."" The problem pre-dates the Obamacare and has long been among the top complaints filed with state insurance regulators.
Because the issue is complex and pits powerful rivals against one anotherâ€” among them, hospitals, doctors and insurersâ€” relatively few states have addressed it. What laws do exist are generally limited to specific situations, such as emergency room care, or certain types of insurance plans, such as HMOs.
Obamacare largely sidesteps the issue as well. It says insurers must include coverage for emergency care and not charge policyholders higher copayments for ER services at non-network hospitals. While the insurer will pay a portion of the bill, in such cases, doctors or hospitals may still bill patients for the difference.

That means that in spite of having insurance, a consumer involved in a car wreck and taken to a non-network hospital might receive additional bills, not just from the hospital, but from the radiologist who read his X-rays, the surgeon who repaired his broken leg and the laboratory that processed his blood tests.
Networks Get Narrower
Advocates believe a growing number of consumers are vulnerable to balance billing as insurance networks grow smaller in the bid to hold down costs.
For example, there were no in-network emergency room physicians or anesthesiologists in some of the hospitals participating in plans offered by three large insurers in Texas in 2013 and 2014, according to a survey of state data by the Center for Public Policy Priorities, a Texas advocacy group.
Smaller networks are also becoming more common in employer-based insurance: About 23% of job-based plans had so-called ""narrow networks"" in 2012, up from 15% in 2007, according to a May report from the Urban Institute and Georgetown University Center on Health Insurance Reforms.
To protect consumers, advocacy groups want regulators to strictly limit balance billing when an insured person gets care in a medical facility that is part of an insurer's network.
Some states have taken other steps to protect consumers:
â€¢ Colorado insurers must pay non-network medical providers their full charges, not discounted network rates, for care at in-network hospitals.
â€¢ In Maryland, insurers must pay for ""covered services,"" which includes emergency care, but the state sets standardized payment rates.
â€¢ Starting in April, New Yorkers won't face extra bills for out-of-network emergency care, when an in-network provider is unavailable or when they aren't told ahead of time that they may be treated by a non-participating provider. Instead, the bills must be settled in arbitration between the providers and the insurance companies.

Cost Trade-Offs
Insurers defend the move to smaller networks of doctors and hospitals as a way to provide the low-cost plans that consumers say they want.
If regulators required them to fully cover charges by out-of-network doctors, that could reduce ""incentives for providers to participate in networks"" and make it harder to have adequate networks, America's Health Insurance Plans, the insurers' trade group, and the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association wrote in a joint letter to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC).
It would also raise premiums.
Instead, AHIP says, states could require out-of-network doctors to accept a benchmark payment from insurers, perhaps what Medicare pays, rather than balance billing patients.
Physicians, meanwhile, blame insurers for inadequate networks.
""It is the limited coverage, not the physician bill, which is the cause of the unfairness,"" the Texas Medical Association wrote to the NAIC.
At the very least, doctors and hospitals say insurers need to do a better job of educating policyholders that their plans may not cover care provided by some doctors and hospitals. And not all doctors choose to balance bill.
For patients like Durocher, the only recourse is to negotiate with the physician or hospital to ask them to lower or drop the charges.
""Fortunately for me,"" Durocher said, ""this doctor was very nice and wrote off almost $7,000 of the bill.""

How To Protect Yourself From ""Balance"" Bills
1) Check your insurer's website to verify that the hospital or doctor is listed, and then call the provider to be sure. Use in-network providers whenever possible. Be aware that some health-care providers may be in-network only at specific offices.
2) Be aware you could be billed by an out-of-network doctor even at an in-network hospital. Some plans will cover those costs fully, especially for emergency care, but many do not. When possible, request a network doctor, anesthesiologist or specialist in advance of elective surgery. If you are billed by a non-network provider, call your plan to find out if it will cover the bill because you were at an in-network hospital.
3) If you get a balance bill, double-check to make sure the doctor or hospital is not part of your network. If they are not in your plan, check with your state insurance regulator to see if there are rules that might protect you, especially in an emergency situation. Ask the doctor or hospital to reconsider. If they won't, complain to your health plan and whoever regulates it, as well as to your state's consumer assistance program, if there is one.
4) Negotiate. If there are no plan policies or state rules to prevent the billing, negotiate with the providers to lower their charges to an amount close to what an insurer would pay. Your insurer's website might have pricing information. Websites, such as Fair Health or Health Care Bluebook, can also help determine the prices of various procedures.

The Starbucks (SBUX) CEO called out former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani for questioning President Obama's ""love"" for his country.
""As an American, I find Rudy Giuliani's vicious comments about President Obama 'not loving America' to be profoundly offensive to both the President and the Office,"" Schultz said in a statement.
Giuliani caused a political stir this week with his remarks about Obama at a dinner event featuring Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, in a speech first reported by Politico. He said he didn't believe Obama ""loves America.""
In an interview with CNN on Thursday, Giuliani followed up by saying he believed Obama ""was brought up in an atmosphere in which he was taught to be a critic of America.""

Schultz has weighed in several times in recent years at what he sees as political dysfunction.
He called Giuliani's remarks ""yet another example of the extreme rhetoric that continues to divide our country rather than uniting us in common purpose.""
Last fall, he called on Congress to get its act together and act with ""civility."" During the ""fiscal cliff"" fiasco in December 2011, he urged lawmakers to ""come together.""

Nike is bringing back some vintage kicks from the pre-Jordan era: the Classic Cortez running shoes that were a hit in the 70's and worn in the 1994 feel-good flick ""Forrest Gump.""
Even those who never ran a marathon in the Cortez shoes -- or weren't alive in the '70s -- might still recognize them from the Tom Hanks film, where his character Gump wears them on a cross-country run from Alabama to the Southwest. Gump also wears them in the famous park bench scene where he cogitates about chocolates.
The Nike Cortez shoes, with their streamlined features and herringbone style soles, might have looked cutting edge when they first went on the market back in 1972. That's when Nixon was president and the U.S. was still fighting a war in Vietnam (instead of making shoes there).
Nike (NKE) is selling the Cortez, in that same red, white and blue design worn by Gump, starting on February 28 at select stores around the world. They can also be ordered online.

The Cortez shoes, which were invented by Nike co-founder Bill Bowerman, are going for $100 a pair. That's cheaper than most adult-sized shoes in Nike's hot Air Jordan line, like the Future Premium, which is discounted to $300.
They're also a lot cheaper than Kanye West's recently released Yeezy Boost shoes, a limited edition line retailing for $350 but going for more than $1,000 on eBay (EBAY, Tech30).

2015-02-15 05:38:43,"Coming soon: A change in who gets overtime pay - Feb. 15, 2015 ",http://money.cnn.com/2015/02/15/pf/overtime-pay/index.html,"The Obama administration is expected to move forward soon on its plan to provide overtime pay protections to low-salaried managers who don't qualify for them.
The move could affect millions of workers. It is aimed at addressing what the White House says is an erosion of the rules that established the 40-hour workweek -- a ""linchpin of the middle class.""
The way it works now, companies can avoid paying OT to any full-time workers making as little as $23,660 -- or $455 a week -- by classifying them as ""exempt"" and paying them as salaried employees, rather than hourly.
That means when they don't get overtime pay even if they work more than 40 hours a week.
And it's not just managers in lower-paid jobs in this bucket. Exempt positions also include administrators and sales employees, among others.
The expectation among policy experts is that the Department of Labor will propose raising the $23,660 income threshold, most likely to somewhere between $42,000 and $52,000. The agency may also amend how ""exempt"" duties are determined.
What advocates want: The liberal Economic Policy Institute estimates that 3.5 million more workers would become eligible for overtime pay if the threshold were raised to $42,000. And 6.1 million workers would qualify if the threshold approaches $52,000.
Advocates for an increase, like EPI and the National Employment Law Project, would like to see the threshold raised to at least $51,168 -- or $984 a week.
That threshold would provide automatic overtime eligibility for 47% of workers. That's up from 12% today but still below the 65% eligible in 1975.
What's more, advocates would like the Labor Department to be more specific as to what makes a position exempt from overtime. For example, to be classified as an exempt administrative employee, a worker's primary duty must include the ""the exercise of discretion and independent judgment with respect to matters of significance.""
Related: Minimum wage increases will give raises to 3 million workers
Since every job requires some independent judgment, ""that's meaningless,"" said Judi Conti, NELP's federal advocacy coordinator.
She would rather the department require that at least 51% of a worker's time be spent on exempt duties.
That would help prevent hollow promotions where a low-paid worker is given the title of manager but not given much managerial power, Conti noted.
What concerns employers: More generous overtime protections, of course, will mean higher payroll costs.
Companies either would end up paying time-and-a-half to more eligible workers, or they may decide it's less expensive to hire more people to cover the extra hours once worked by formerly exempt employees.
But just how much more they'll have to pay is a concern.
""One [income] threshold for the whole country won't work,"" said Marc Freedman, executive director of labor law policy at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
The Chamber has recommended that the Labor Department apply geographically specific thresholds.
A big change in the income threshold would require employers to reclassify millions of salaried workers to hourly -- and that could cause workers to lose some employee benefits, said Mike Aitken, vice president for government affairs at the Society for Human Resource Management.
Their morale could suffer too.
For instance, while salaried workers are often given some latitude to schedule their day, hourly workers may get pay docked or have to use vacation time for midday appointments, Aitken said.
Some companies, too, offer merit-based bonuses to salaried workers but not to hourly ones. Or they may be put on a different vesting schedule for vacation days, he added.
Related: Many low-wage workers not protected by minimum wage
What's ahead: The Labor Department has February marked on its agenda for release of the proposed overtime rules. But some policy observers suspect the release could come in March or April.
Whenever they new rules are released, however, it will be the start of a comment-and-review process that could take months before anything is finalized.
Advocates for change hope it won't take too long. If the new rules go into effect right before President Obama leaves office, the next president could undo them if he or she doesn't like them."

Apple sold a record 74.8 million iPhones in the fourth quarter of 2014, giving it 20.4% of the global smartphone market, according to new research from Gartner.
That was enough to push Apple (AAPL, Tech30) ahead of Samsung (SSNLF), which had 19.9% of the market in the quarter.
The last time Apple held the top spot was in the fourth quarter of 2011.
The blockbuster sales of iphones also pushed overall smartphone sales over 1 billion for the first time ever. In 2014, there were 1.2 billion smartphones sold worldwide, up 28% from 2013.
Overall, smartphones accounted for two thirds of all mobile phone sales last year.
Related: Apple stock is making regular Americans rich
Apple's breakthrough came on the heels of a deal with China's biggest mobile provider, China Mobile (CHL). That deal benefited Apple in a big way, with sales in China surging 70% last quarter.
Making such gigantic inroads in China was once believed impossible. Apple's brand did not hold the same cache as some Chinese smartphone makers, including Xiaomi, Lenovo (LNVGF) and Huawei. And those brands heavily discount their phones, making them far more accessible to the masses than the iPhone.
Apple also rolled out the new iPhone 6 to other countries faster than it had in previous years which helped boost sales. The iPhone 6 is available in 130 countries. Apple also said its supplier efficiencies helped the company manufacture 7 million more iPhones than it had expected to make last quarter.
Related: Apple iPhone import ban sought by suit
But the iPhone's expected success isn't solely due to China, the global market or supply chains.
The iPhone 6 has proven extremely popular with customers who were holding out for a bigger Apple smartphone. The 4.7-inch screen competes much better with some larger Android smartphones, and the superior camera has helped some would-be defectors stick with the iPhone brand.
Samsung (SSNLF) still outsold Apple for the full year. The South Korean company sold more than 307 million phones in 2014. Apple came in second, with over 191 million smartphone sales, followed by Lenovo (LNVGF), Huawei and LG Electronics.

He doesn't just own the products, he owns the stock. He's made close to $50,000 since he first bought Apple shares in 2007.
While working his way through college in Maryland, he took all the money he had to his name -- about $4,000 -- and bought the stock. Friends thought he was a little nuts. Now they kick themselves for not following his lead.
The first iPhone captivated him. He lined up when they went on sale and traveled to Europe about two weeks later. People kept coming up to him on the streets of London wanting to touch it since it wasn't available there yet.
""I said, 'Oh my God, this is going to be huge,'"" Gerb said, speaking to CNNMoney on his current iPhone 6 Plus.
Over time, he has added to his Apple stake, holding it in both his retirement account and his ""play money"" brokerage account. He estimates Apple stock makes up close to 45% of his investment portfolio.
""I'm sure any financial adviser would say I'm nuts. They would say diversify, but I trust in Apple,"" Gerb says.

Related: Apple: First U.S. company worth $700 billion
Apple as Social Security: Gerb is hardly alone. Apple is one of the most popular stocks on the planet. People are making big money off the stock's phenomenal rise in the last decade.
In January 2005, the stock was trading for around $5 a share. Today it's worth about $130 a share and is the most valuable company in the world.
Bruce Cowling, a 64-year-old retiree in Florida, is a more recent Apple enthusiast.

When Cowling started collecting Social Security in September 2012, he invested most of the money in Apple stock.
He was fortunate to have a pension after many years working for the state government in Pennsylvania and being frugal. He and his wife didn't need the Social Security money right away, so they looked for somewhere to put the cash and grow it in the hopes of giving some of it to their children one day.
Cowling follows the company religiously now. He has bought an Apple TV and MacBook. He's skeptical about the rumors of Apple getting into the car business, but he thinks the watch and latest iPhones have a lot of room to run.
Share your story: How did you start investing?
""I still think they will make a lot of money off the iPhone, and, of course, they make a ton of money in China,"" he says.
Today he owns about 1,225 shares of Apple stock and has earned a net profit of around $45,000. It's all unrealized gains at this point, since he's not planning on selling any time soon. A number of Wall Street analysts predict the stock will climb to $150 or higher.
Crowling's only complaint? Apple's skimpy dividend.

Why I sold Apple: It's a similar gripe from other retirees who hold Apple stock and depend on that income. Apple does pay a 1.5% dividend (tech companies aren't known for big dividends), but that's small relative to other stocks.
Hedge fund titan Carl Icahn has repeatedly pushed Apple to give more money back to shareholders through a bigger dividend or share buyback.
Randy Anglin, a 65-year-old retiree in Missouri finally got so fed up waiting for Apple to return some of its $175 billion in cash to shareholders that he sold the stock in December when it was trading around $110. He still made about a 30% return on his investment -- real money -- since he held it for many years.
""I rode Apple to highs up to $700 and down to $386. I still remember that. I bought more Apple stock in 2013,"" he told CNNMoney.
But he realized that he also owned mutual funds. Since Apple is the biggest public company on the planet, many of his funds also had large stakes in Apple. He ran the numbers and realized that Apple stock was nearly 20% of his portfolio. That's a very, very big bet on one company.
""I didn't really part ways with Apple, I just parted ways with a chunk of it,"" he says. ""If Apple had a 4% or 5% dividend, I would jump back in.""

They removed the photos from a wall and painted over the words under them: ""He's been there, he'll be there"" -- a tagline for a celebration of Williams' 10th anniversary on the ""NBC Nightly News.""
The next day the workers returned and put the pictures back up. But NBC employees were already buzzing with gossip.
The official word was that the temporary exhibit had been accidentally taken down two weeks early, and that's why it was restored. The unofficial response was ... more sarcastic.
No one knows what's next for NBC News, and that's why even the walls are being studied for clues.
Related: Brian Williams once eyed David Letterman's job
Friday's big shakeup -- Andy Lack replacing Pat Fili-Krushel as the chairman of NBC News -- is a clear sign of corporate dissatisfaction with the news division.
Lack's challenges start at ""Nightly News"" but don't end there. He has to restore confidence in the news division, improve morale among the rank-and-file, and regain ratings momentum at the network's most important news asset, the ""Today"" show.
Lack, now 67, led the news division to greatness as its president in the 1990s. But the news industry has been flipped on its head since then, thanks to the Internet and smart phones.
After being introduced as the new chairman at an NBC staff meeting on Friday morning, he made a throwback joke: ""How many hours is 'Dateline' on now?""
Expanding the newsmagazine franchise was a top achievement two decades ago, but it's not the answer now.
On Sunday, New York magazine published a much-anticipated story about what it called ""chaos"" within the news division.
""The trouble didn't start with Brian Williams,"" the tagline to the story said.
""Over the past year,"" reporter Gabriel Sherman wrote, ""all of the NBC News marquee franchises -- 'Today,' 'Meet the Press,' 'Nightly News' -- have been badly damaged by bungled talent decisions and control-room shakeups. Taken together, the upheavals portray a news division that has allowed talent to take over.""
The magazine quoted a senior NBC executive as saying ""there's no adult supervision,"" despite the fact that NBCUniversal CEO Steve Burke put Fili-Krushel in charge back in 2012 to be ""adult supervision.""
Separately, a lengthy Business Insider story listed a number of insider complaints about Fili-Krushel earlier this week.
Fili-Krushel has not said anything publicly about Williams or herself. On Friday, Burke said Fili-Krushel ""will move into a new role on my executive team"" once Lack takes over in April.
NBC News president Deborah Turness remains in place, but her role will be ""substantially diminished"" with Lack in charge, Sherman wrote.
Related: 52% say Brian Williams should be allowed back on
In the coming months, Lack and Burke will have to make what will likely be their most high-profile decision: whether to let Williams return to ""Nightly News.""
At the moment, Williams remains determined to mount a comeback. Sherman quotes a close friend as saying, ""He can't wait until he can speak. He's just anxious to get back to work. And he can't wait to respond.""
Lack and Williams have been friendly for decades, and Sherman reports that when NBC was deciding how to handle the controversy about Williams' embellishments, ""Lack called Burke and asked him to spare Williams with a short suspension.""
Some executives in the TV industry believe Lack will stand by Williams and seek to rehabilitate the anchor when the six-month suspension period is up in August. Others, however, are not so sure. They cite internal anger at Williams and the inherent risk in bringing him back.
And they speculate that Lack's ability to talk frankly with Williams -- friend-to-friend -- could ease the transition from Williams to another anchor, like Lester Holt, who is currently filling in.
On CNN's ""Reliable Sources,"" former CBS News president Andrew Heyward said much the same thing a senior NBC source said to me earlier on Sunday morning: that Williams' fate is ultimately a business calculation, and ultimately up to Burke.
""It's going to be a decision that has the interest of NBC News and, not to sound too corny, the American public at heart,"" Heyward said. ""It's not going to be based on friendship or anything like that. It's going to be a business-like decision based on whatever facts are on the ground at the time, including the review that NBC is still doing.""

And rich people are rushing to buy passports in search of safe places to shelter their families and their money.
Many countries offer so-called golden visas that grant residence permits and, in some cases, citizenship in exchange for sizable investments. The investments are typically made in bonds, property or cash donations to the host government.
The programs are luring growing numbers of nationals from the Middle East, China and Russia. And demand is expected to increase as political instability drives rich individuals to seek economic and geographic safety.
""Wealthy people are looking for safe places to relocate in case of crisis,"" said Armand Arton, chief executive of Arton Capital, a company that advises on investor citizenship programs.
He said demand is growing by as much as 15% per year, and the threat of ISIS in the Middle East along with international sanctions in Russia will continue to fuel interest. Investors are also lured by the promise of visa-free travel, plus access to education and services.
Related: Rich Russians buy U.K. investor visas in record numbers
Among the beneficiaries are the U.K., which has seen a record number of applications from Russia as economic conditions in the country deteriorate.
Experts advising on investor permits for Ireland, Malta and Bulgaria also reported steady interest from Russia last year.
During the same period, an influx of Chinese applicants exhausted U.S. supplies of investor visas.
The bulk of the golden visa programs are clustered in Europe, many of which were devised following the financial crisis as a way for cash-strapped governments to boost revenues. A number of countries in the Caribbean also open their borders to rich investors.
The costs vary widely. Cyprus will make you a citizen for a cool â‚¬2.5 million investment ($2.9 million) in real estate. Dominica -- a tiny nation in the Caribbean -- offers citizenship for just $100,000.

The industry is expanding and Arton said the number of countries offering investor visas has more than doubled in the past 10 years.
And as competition intensifies, nations are attempting to make their programs more attractive. For example, Bulgaria will fast-track citizenship if investors double their â‚¬512,000 ($594,600) investment.
The cash-for-passports industry has been running for about 30 years. Schemes first cropped up in North America, Australia and the U.K. -- safe places for wealthy citizens looking to relocate or invest their funds.
These regions accept the highest numbers of investor migrants. Data from Arton Capital shows that smaller countries including Bulgaria, Portugal and St Kitts and Nevis also issued several hundred investor visas in 2013 -- while Hungary granted 1,075.

One the newest and most expensive plans is already generating plenty of interest. Launched in early 2014, Malta charges $1.4 million for citizenship. Advisory firm Henley & Partners helped design the program, which has received 400 applications from more than 40 nationalities so far.
But the bar to entry is high, and not just financially.

Raimondi said she's been offered other jobs, but at lower salaries. Meanwhile, she has to shell out more for rent, utilities, food and school supplies for her daughter, an honors high school student. And after her employer restructured the firm's health insurance plan, she's paying 10 times more for medical care.

He and his co-workers were recently reminiscing about the days a decade ago when they got decent raises. Now, Squires is sleeping under extra blankets to try to lower his heating costs and has cut down on buying fresh fruit and fish for himself and his wife, though he still provides it for his two young children at home. Healthy food is now a luxury, not a weekly staple for him.

The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA), which oversees the IRS, has received reports of 290,000 scam calls since October 2013 and said nearly 3,000 victims have been swindled out of $14 million so far.
By altering their caller ID number to make it look like they're calling from an IRS office, these scammers often threaten vulnerable people like the elderly and new immigrants with things like arrest, deportation or the loss of their driver's license if they don't pay immediately for money purportedly owed.

Often leaving messages that say it's ""urgent"" you call them back, the scammers use common names and sometimes say they are from the IRS Criminal Division. They may even claim to know the last four digits of your Social Security number and send follow-up emails that appear to be from the IRS, TIGTA said.
They often demand that payments be made by prepaid debit card.
Once they make their threats, the scammers have been known to call back and again disguise their caller ID so it appears they are calling from the police department or the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV).
Or sometimes when they call, they may say you have a refund due and ask you to provide personal information so you can claim it.
The real IRS will usually contact you by regular mail first, if it needs to contact you at all. And the agency never demands immediate payment by phone or asks for credit card or debit numbers if they do call. It also never asks for personal or financial information by email, text or social media.
If you get what you suspect is a scam call, report it to TIGTA through its Web site or call 800-366-4484.

Yet Bill and Melinda Gates believe banking -- specifically the mobile variety -- can be the source of great good in the near future, helping to lift millions of people out of poverty.
In its annual letter published on Thursday, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation identified mobile banking as one of four exciting breakthroughs that will help improve the lives of people in poor countries faster in the next 15 years than at any other time in history.
""Mobile banking will help the poor transform their lives,"" the billionaire couple wrote in the letter.
At first glance, mobile banking is a surprising choice for the Gates Foundation to throw its incredible heft behind. In the past, the philanthropy, which controls over $42 billion in assets, has focused challenges like access to condoms and turning human waste into drinking water.
But now the power couple is thinking about the 2.5 billion adults the World Bank estimates are without a bank account.
Related: Bill and Melinda Gates predict what the world will be like in 2030
Literally stuffing cash in a mattress: People in rich countries can drive or walk to the bank, use digital services like PayPal and write checks that can be deposited, sometimes even by taking a picture with a smartphone.
Those aren't really options if you don't have a bank account. People in poor countries often keep cash at home, literally stuffing it in the mattress. Or they invest it in an asset like lifestock that can lose value over time.
""If their savings are in the form of jewelry or livestock, for example, they can't very well chip off tiny pieces to cover routine daily expenses,"" Bill and Melinda Gates wrote.
Related: World's top cities: Zurich. Paris. Hartford?
Mobile = more control: Sending money to friends or relatives can also be difficult, with people in poor countries needing to take off from work to deliver it by hand or rely on a courier.
Borrowing money without a bank account can be even more problematic, with some lenders charging exorbitant rates.
""Digital banking will give the poor more control over their assets,"" the couple wrote.
Many developing countries like Kenya are rapidly adopting mobile banking. Gates estimates that by 2030, about 2 billion people who don't have a bank account today will be storing money and making mobile payments.
Related: London is the fastest growing western city
Mobile roadblocks: But to get to that level, mobile banking needs to overcome some big hurdles.
One obvious problem is the need to increase access to mobile phones, especially in countries like Bangladesh where women have fallen way behind men in this category.
The Gates Foundation also highlighted the need to convince regulators to revamp their laws in a way that encourages innovators to enter.
And while digital currency is great, poor countries need to develop enough physical locations for people to be able to convert this money into hard currency.
Interestingly, the focus by Gates and others like Visa (V) and MasterCard (MA) on mobile banking in poor nations could mean residents there enjoy services that Americans don't have access to yet.
""Entrepreneurs in developing countries are doing exciting work -- some of which will 'trickle up' to developed countries over time,"" Gates said.

2015-01-19 10:16:30,"International Monetary Fund: The world economy is worse off than we thought - Jan. 19, 2015 ",http://money.cnn.com/2015/01/19/news/economy/imf-world-outlook/index.html,"Sorry folks, the world economy is not going to improve much this year. Or next year.
The world economy will grow by just 3.5% in 2015, and by 3.7% in 2016, according to the latest estimate from the International Monetary Fund. Both estimates are down 0.3 percentage points from the group's previous forecast, made in October.
One bright spot was the United States: The IMF revised its estimate for U.S. economic growth to 3.6% this year, up half a percentage point from the October forecast.
The IMF estimates underscore the difficult set of choices facing policymakers around the world.

In the wake of the global financial crisis, trillions of dollars have been pumped into the world economy in the form of cheap central bank cash, boosting stocks, bonds and real estate prices.
Yet growth remains limited. Even drastically lower oil prices will have limited impact on stimulating the overall economy.
""New factors supporting growth -- lower oil prices, but also depreciation of euro and yen -- are more than offset by persistent negative forces,"" said IMF chief economist Olivier Blanchard.
Related: China posts its worst growth in 24 years
Russia is expected to be among the hardest hit nations, with the IMF predicting a 3% contraction this year, followed by another 1% decline in 2016. Both figures are sharply lower than the October estimate.
China, the world's second-largest economy, will continue its slowdown, with growth hitting 6.8% this year and 6.3% next year.
The IMF said growth could be stronger than forecast if lower oil prices deliver a greater boost than assumed. Growth could take a hit if volatility spikes in emerging markets.

2015-02-12 11:06:12,"David Carr, New York Times columnist, dies at 58 - Feb. 12, 2015 ",http://money.cnn.com/2015/02/12/media/david-carr-new-york-times-obit-dead/index.html,"New York Times media columnist David Carr has died at 58, his employer announced late Thursday.
One of the New York Times' most engaging and colorful personalities, Carr was a stalwart of the media beat, helping readers -- and other journalists -- make sense of the rapidly changing industry.
Carr wrote the ""Media Equation"" column for The Times, which was published on Mondays. His writing style was conversational, analytic and peppered with humor. A reporter's reporter, Carr didn't just write about journalism -- he practiced it, taking on media heavyweights with in-depth pieces that exposed wrongdoing.
Before joining The Times, Carr reported for The Atlantic Monthly and New York magazine. But he made his name in the punchy world of alt weeklies -- first as editor of the The Twin Cities Reader, and later the Washington City Paper. He specialized in culture coverage, writing about music, television and film with ease.
In 2008, Carr published a memoir called ""The Night of the Gun,"" a chronicle of his struggle with addiction, and subsequent recovery. The account was brutally honest, tracing his journey from troubled drug user to loving family man and successful professional.

In one passage, Carr describes a night spent at the north Minneapolis home of his then-girlfriend and dope dealer. Trapped in a ""drug-induced paranoia,"" he narrowly escapes arrest when police officers arrive in the neighborhood.
Years later, Carr returned to the house: ""Sitting there in a suit with a nice job in a city far away and those twins on their way to college, I almost would have thought I'd made it up,"" he wrote. ""But I don't think I did.""
Carr won plaudits for the book, which he reported over the course of two years.
""My story is charming or horrifying, depending on which part of it you focus on,"" Carr said of the memoir.

Tributes from colleagues and friends were immediate.
""On a personal level, David was one of the most generous men I've ever known,"" CNN's Brian Stelter said. Carr and Stelter worked together at The Times for six years and appeared together in the 2011 documentary ""Page One: Inside The New York Times.""
""David mentored and nurtured countless journalists, and I was so lucky to be one of them,"" Stelter said. ""I loved him like a father and he treated me like a son.""
""On a professional level, David was a giant,"" Stelter said. ""He was the most important, most influential reporter of this tumultuous era in media. Readers, journalists and media moguls all looked to him to make sense of the present chaos and contemplate the future. And David never disappointed. The future without him is terrible to contemplate.""
Bill Carter, another longtime colleague of Carr's, wrote on Twitter, ""Can't possibly find words. David Carr was brilliant, funny, generous. My heart breaks for his family+his legion of friends. Proud to be one.""
Carr passed away after collapsing at the The Times office in Manhattan. Earlier in the evening, he had moderated a discussion about the film ""Citizenfour.""
Related: Who we've lost in 2015
Arthur Sulzberger, Jr., publisher of The Times, said in a statement that Carr was ""one of the most gifted journalists"" to ever work at the newspaper.
Dean Baquet, the executive editor of paper, was equally effusive in his praise, describing Carr as ""the finest media reporter of his generation,"" and a ""remarkable and funny man.""
""He was our biggest champion, and his unending passion for journalism and for truth will be missed by his family at The Times, by his readers around the world, and by people who love journalism,"" Baquet said.
Carr was also a Times exceptionalist. In one particularly notable defense of his employer, captured in the documentary film Page One, Carr stopped an interview with the founders of Vice after they criticized the newspaper's coverage of Liberia.
""Just a sec -- time out,"" Carr said. ""Before [Vice] ever went there, we've had reporters there reporting on genocide after genocide. Just because you put on a [expletive] safari helmet and went and looked at some poop, that doesn't give you the right to insult what we do.""

2015-01-20 12:09:59,"Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo: We intend to sue Fox News - Jan. 20, 2015 ",http://money.cnn.com/2015/01/20/media/paris-mayor-sue-fox-news/index.html,"Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo told CNN Tuesday she intends to sue Fox News in the wake of the channel's coverage of supposed ""no-go zones"" for non-Muslims.
Hidalgo said the channel had ""insulted"" her city.
""When we're insulted, and when we've had an image, then I think we'll have to sue, I think we'll have to go to court, in order to have these words removed,"" Hidalgo told CNN's Christiane Amanpour. ""The image of Paris has been prejudiced, and the honor of Paris has been prejudiced.""
Outside legal analysts largely dismissed the likelihood that a lawsuit would succeed.
A few hours after Hidalgo spoke with Amanpour, a Fox News executive called the warning about a lawsuit ""misplaced.""
""We empathize with the citizens of France as they go through a healing process and return to everyday life,"" Fox executive vice president Michael Clemente told CNNMoney in a statement. ""However, we find the mayor's comments regarding a lawsuit misplaced.""
Bill O'Reilly, Fox's highest-rated host, called it ""ridiculous"" on the Tuesday night edition of his program.
He pointed out that ""the mayor is a socialist"" and that ""Fox News isn't even seen in France.""
""So this is just an attention-getter,"" he said. ""Another playing to the left, that's what this is. The suit's going nowhere. It's ridiculous.""
The warning about a lawsuit came after a series of Fox segments suggested there are parts of Paris and other European cities where Islamic law is practiced and where police are fearful to work. The ""no-go"" zone segments were widely mocked and challenged as inaccurate, particularly by French media outlets.
Some critics have accused the network of using the controversial ""no-go zones"" idea to perpetuate a fearful narrative about Muslims, particularly in the days since terror attacks in Paris.
One Fox show, for example, displayed an inaccurate map of the alleged ""no-go zones"" in and around Paris. On another show, a guest who was identified as a security expert claimed that Birmingham, England is a ""totally Muslim city where non-Muslims don't go in.""
Among those who ridiculed the Fox News claims was British Prime Minister David Cameron, who said of the Birmingham claim: ""When I heard this, frankly, I choked on my porridge and I thought it must be April Fools Day.""
Fox News anchors issued several apologies on Saturday for the segments.
With regards to Paris, ""some of the neighborhoods were highlighted incorrectly,"" host Anna Kooiman said.
At another point, Julie Banderas issued a blanket apology to ""the people of France and England.""
Citing the apologies and the embarrassment suffered by Fox, CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said ""the system has worked"" and ""the courts don't need to get involved here.""
Other media law experts said that in the U.S., where Fox is based, a lawsuit for defamation filed by a city would likely be tossed out right away.
""A claim like this would never succeed in a United States court because there's no such thing as defamation"" of a municipality, said Jeff Hermes of the Media Law Resource Center. (MLRC is nonprofit organization of media outlets; Fox News is a member.)
It's a precedent that was established nearly 100 years ago, when the city of Chicago sued the Chicago Tribune over a series of critical editorials. The Illinois Supreme Court ruled citizens had nearly free range to criticize their government.
So in this case, Paris would be left to pursue a suit in a French court. That's also problematic: Fox News has limited presence there, leaving the justice system with limited leverage over the company.
Also, U.S. law gives media outlets special protections against the decisions of foreign courts.
A 2010 law called the SPEECH Act ""was designed to protect American publishers from defamation lawsuits overseas,"" said Anthony Fargo, a professor and director of the Center for International Media Law and Policy Studies at Indiana University. He, too, thinks it unlikely a U.S. court would hear the case.
CNN, the owner of this web site, was once sued by a small town in Brazil, but CNN won the case on appeal."

President Obama wants Congress to pass legislation that would allow employees to earn up to seven days of paid sick leave a year.
While federal law currently does not require sick leave, it's a common benefit for government workers and full-time employees at big corporations.
But nearly 43 million private-sector workers don't get paid sick leave, according to the White House.
So who are these workers?
They're usually part time: About 74% of full-time workers get paid sick leave, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics, while around 24% of part-time workers get the perk.

They work for small businesses: Smaller companies are more likely not to offer paid sick leave, largely because of cost. Around half of firms with 50 or fewer workers offer the benefit while 81% of those with 500-plus employees have it, according to Paul Harrington, director of the Center for Labor Markets and Policy at Drexel University.
Related: U.S. is 65th in world on gender pay gap
They're often in the service industry: Workers with service sector jobs, like food service or hospitality, are likely to go without sick time, along with those in health-care support services, including home health aids or dental assistants.
""Those are the exact type of jobs that you want people to stay at home because they have such high interactions with customers and co-workers,"" said Jessica Milli, a senior research associate at The Institute for Women's Policy Research.
Many are Hispanic: Hispanic employees are less likely to have paid sick leave than white, Asian or black workers, according to Milli, with less than half of Hispanic workers getting the benefit.
They're on the lower end of the income ladder: Government data show 90% of the top 10% of earners get paid sick time off, while 21% in the bottom 10% get it.
""Part of that is that you are more likely to be part time in the [lower bracket],"" said Harrington.
Related: Behind the 78 cent wage gap
The costs and benefits:
The Labor Department puts the cost of paid sick leave at 34 cents an hour per worker, or about 1% of total compensation. To make up for the added cost, experts predict that employers could cut back on other compensation costs, like taking away paid holidays, lowering wages, or pulling back on hiring or raises.
But putting the cost of a mandate on the government could help smaller firms handle the burden.
""Paying the costs through unemployment insurance or disability or some other form of federal or state government [funds] might make the case easier to push forward,"" said Aparna Mathur, an economist at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute.
Offering sick days often leads to increased productivity and reduced health-care costs for businesses. It also benefits children by allowing parents to stay home with a sick child.
""When we aren't operating at 100% ... that represents a cost to employers,"" said Milli. ""Allowing them to stay home means a faster recovery and fewer co-workers getting sick also brings savings.

Then the snowy calm. And then the questions about when business will return to normal.
Parts of the Northeast began digging themselves out Tuesday after a storm that shut down highways, mass transit and air travel.
By afternoon in New York City, where the hit wasn't as great as feared, the roads were largely cleared, subways were back in service and a strict travel ban imposed the night before had been lifted.
Flights began again from New York's LaGuardia Airport, where 11 inches of snow had accumulated by Tuesday morning. Spirit Airlines became the first major carrier with scheduled takeoffs and arrivals, the airline said. (The first departure was headed for Tampa, which chalked up zero inches of snow.)
At the same time, folks in the Boston area were bracing for several more hours of snow from a storm that was described as a potentially ""historic"" blizzard. They likely face a steeper climb to return to normal.
Air travel is where the impact is most readily noticed, and the ripple effect of canceled flights means it will likely be days before travel is back the way it was.
The airlines should be operating as usual by Friday, said Tulinda Larsen, president of the travel analysis firm masFlight. But rebooking passengers whose flights have been canceled likely will last into next week.
Thousands of flights were canceled on Monday and Tuesday, and masFlight estimated Tuesday morning that at least 400,000 travelers were affected by flight cancellations alone.
If you were planning on traveling by plane, train or automobile this week, here's what you need to know:

By train:
--Amtrak: The rail line canceled all Tuesday trips on several of its busy lines in the Northeast. It suspended Northeast Regional and Acela Express trains between New York and Boston, as well as Empire Service, Amtrak Downeaster, Vermonter and the Springfield line. The Lake Shore Limited and trains between New York and Washington, D.C., will conduct only partial service on Tuesday, Amtrak said. More from Amtrak.
--Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority: The greater Boston T said it will be closed all day and evening Tuesday. More from MBTA.
--New Jersey Transit: Service closed Monday evening but reopened on a reduced schedule on Tuesday. More from NJ Transit.
--New York City Transit: All service ended at 11 p.m. on Monday night but slowly returned on Tuesday. The nation's largest single public transport network ran additional trains on Monday afternoon to get commuters fleeing work early before the weather hit.

By road: The storm is making for slick roads, including along major highways like I-70, I-80 I-84 and I-95. Travel bans put in place Monday evening were largely lifted Tuesday morning, but in many places, the conditions were still rough. ""I am asking everyone in NJ who doesn't have to drive this morning please don't. And those that do, please drive slow,"" New Jersey Governor Chris Christie posted on Twitter around what would have been the Tuesday morning commute.
--Connecticut: Highways closed Monday evening but re-opened at 2 p.m. on Tuesday.
--New Jersey: A ban on driving in the state was lifted after daybreak on Tuesday.
--New York City: Roads, including bridges and tunnels into the city, closed at 11 p.m. Monday but were reopened Tuesday morning. A statewide ban on suburban counties was also lifted.
--Massachusetts: Many roads closed at midnight on Tuesday, and cars parked on major roads in Boston after 6 p.m. were at risk of being towed. Some roads were later re-opened, but the ban on travel along I-90, a major thoroughfare known as the Mass Pike, remained.
--Philadelphia: Cars parked on major city streets after 6 p.m. were towed.

By plane: More than 4,700 flights on Tuesday were canceled, according to the tracker service FlightAware, on top of the more than 2,800 flights canceled on Monday and hundreds more already scrapped for Wednesday. The three major airports in the New York area were among those most affected. Those cancellations will ripple out through the country and it will likely be days before service is back to usual.
--American Airlines (AAL) and U.S. Airways: American planned for only ""very limited operations (on Tuesday) in the Northeast,"" including in Boston, New York and Philadelphia. The airlines will let customers flying to or from two dozen airports in the region rebook reservations made for Monday and Tuesday without a fee. More from American. More from U.S. Airways.
--Delta Air Lines (DAL): The airline canceled all flights out of the three major New York-area on Tuesday after canceling approximately 600 flights scheduled for Monday. Customers were urged to rebook flights, and the airline said it would do so without no extra fee. It said service at New York's JFK and La Guardia airports was slated to resume on Wednesday morning. More from Delta.
--Frontier Airlines: Customers traveling from airports in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, and the Washington area may rebook without penalty. More from Frontier.
--JetBlue (JBLU): Flights in and out of the Northeast were canceled on Tuesday, and customers were allowed to rebook before February 1. More from Jet Blue.
--Southwest Airlines (LUV): It said customers traveling to and from the Northeast could reschedule without a fee. More from Southwest.
--Spirit Airlines (SAVE): The airline warned travel in and out of Boston would continue to be difficult through Wednesday. Travelers arriving at or departing from nine airports in the Northeast may reschedule their travel between now and February 3.
--United Airlines (UAL): The airline resumed some flights into and out of it's key hub, Newark, but said all flights to Boston and other New England-area airports were canceled through Wednesday.
--Virgin America (VA): The airline advised travelers headed into or out of Boston, New York, Newark or Washington airports on Tuesday that they may change their reservation without fees. More from Virgin America.

Windows Holographic is Microsoft's (MSFT, Tech30) insane vision of the future of computing. But it's real, and it's coming soon.
With Windows Holographic, you can see and interact with 3-D images all around you. You can pinch them, pull them, tap them and flick them away. You can ""select"" a hologram just by looking at it, and you can walk around them in 3-D space.
To see and ""touch"" the holograms, you have to wear a special headset called the ""HoloLens."" It kind of looks like Google (GOOGL, Tech30) Glass on steroids -- it fits around your head and has see-through holographic HD lenses that kind of look like ski goggles.
The HoloLens is itself a computer, equipped with a special chip called a holographic processing unit. It understands where you're looking, recognizes your gestures and voice, and it can map your surroundings.
Related: Microsoft unveils Windows 10
The coolest part of HoloLens and Windows Holographic is that it's not just whiz-bang technology for technology's sake. Microsoft presented some actual compelling use cases for it.
In one scene, a woman wearing HoloLens needs help fixing her leaking sink. A man in another city sitting in front of a tablet sees what she is seeing, makes a mark around the correct pipe to turn, and the woman instantly sees a 3-D arrow showing her which pipe to fix.
Other scenes showed people being immersed in video games, performing software-guided surgeries and collaborating with team members on the design of a new motorcycle.
In a live demonstration of a new Microsoft app called HoloStudio, a Microsoft employee created a drone on stage, which she built and then controlled with her voice and her fingers. She then 3-D printed the drone with a virtual tap.
Windows Holographic was created by Microsoft fellow Alex Kipman, who also created the software used in the Xbox Kinect.
The biggest surprise about Windows Holographic was that it was a surprise at all. Today, tech secrets leak out so much that consumers pretty much know exactly what companies will announce well before they take the stage to present it. That wasn't the case with Windows Holographic.
Microsoft took great pains to prevent any leaks. The company said it has been working on the project for years, sending the team to work in a room that sits below Microsoft's visitors center.
""We're not exactly known for having a good track record for keeping secrets,"" Kipman said. ""We were hiding in plain sight.""
Related: Microsoft patents theater mode for your phone
Microsoft didn't give a precise date for when Windows Holographic and HoloLens would come to market. But the company said Windows 10 has already been built to support holographic displays. The holographic technology would be available ""within the Windows 10 timeframe."" Windows 10 is expected to go on sale later this year.
To start, the things people will be able to do with HoloLens will likely be very basic. So don't expect to be able to pick up a virtual gun and play holographic Halo or see a holographic representation of your redesigned kitchen right off the bat.
Like Google did with Glass and Facebook (FB, Tech30) is doing with its Oculus virtual reality headset, Microsoft is creating the hardware and software platform and asking developers to build killer apps and services to make the hologram technology come to life. But Microsoft thinks it created something far superior to Oculus and Glass, and Kipman said Microsoft would like to ""humbly invite"" developers for those platforms to come work with Windows Holographic and HoloLens.
You might not be ready to wear HoloLens on your face, and Microsoft might not convince everyday PC users that holograms are the computing wave of the future.
But that's almost besides the point. With its hologram announcement, Microsoft surprised and impressed the tech world by doing something new and unique.
It signaled that Microsoft shouldn't be discounted when it comes to innovation."
2015-02-09 08:39:14,"Here are the 1,784 RadioShacks set to close - Feb. 9, 2015 ",http://money.cnn.com/2015/02/09/news/companies/radioshack-store-closings/index.html,"RadioShack's plans to close about half of its stores in the next six weeks will impact nearly every state, the company revealed.
It released the list of 1,784 stores it says are due to close by March 31.
Alaska is the only state where no closings have been announced. The state with the most closings is California, with 175, followed by New York and the company's home state of Texas. Vermont has only 2 stores slated to close.
The list shows just how much RadioShack is oversaturated in many markets. The company once bragged 90% of the U.S. population was within minutes of a store. But the network of as many as 5,000 locations became an unaffordable burden, with many stores competing against each other.
On the island of Puerto Rico, for example, there are 56 stores. Forty-five are slated to close.
See interactive map of all RadioShack store closings
The company has not said how many jobs will be lost from the store closings, or from the company giving up about one third of the floor space in its remaining stores to cell phone provider Sprint (S). RadioShack (RSHC) had about 21,000 employees as of its bankruptcy filing.
The closings are part of RadioShack's bankruptcy filing from this past Thursday. According to what staff from across the country told CNNMoney last week, many of the stores have already had their hours and inventories severely reduced, and merely a skeleton staff is left to sell off items at deep discounts.

2015-02-09 08:39:14,"Here are the 1,784 RadioShacks set to close - Feb. 9, 2015 ",http://money.cnn.com/2015/02/09/news/companies/radioshack-store-closings/index.html,"RadioShack's plans to close about half of its stores in the next six weeks will impact nearly every state, the company revealed.
It released the list of 1,784 stores it says are due to close by March 31.
Alaska is the only state where no closings have been announced. The state with the most closings is California, with 175, followed by New York and the company's home state of Texas. Vermont has only 2 stores slated to close.
The list shows just how much RadioShack is oversaturated in many markets. The company once bragged 90% of the U.S. population was within minutes of a store. But the network of as many as 5,000 locations became an unaffordable burden, with many stores competing against each other.
On the island of Puerto Rico, for example, there are 56 stores. Forty-five are slated to close.
See interactive map of all RadioShack store closings
The company has not said how many jobs will be lost from the store closings, or from the company giving up about one third of the floor space in its remaining stores to cell phone provider Sprint (S). RadioShack (RSHC) had about 21,000 employees as of its bankruptcy filing.
The closings are part of RadioShack's bankruptcy filing from this past Thursday. According to what staff from across the country told CNNMoney last week, many of the stores have already had their hours and inventories severely reduced, and merely a skeleton staff is left to sell off items at deep discounts.

2015-02-09 11:53:40,"Will Brian Williams return? - Feb. 9, 2015 ",http://money.cnn.com/2015/02/09/media/brian-williams-future/index.html,"By announcing a leave of absence for ""several days,"" Brian Williams started a ticking clock that will end with his return to the ""NBC Nightly News"" anchor chair. Unless he doesn't return.
A growing number of people inside NBC believe he won't be able to return, but others are more optimistic.
The television news world -- simultaneously close-knit and cutthroat -- is preoccupied by the story. I have never seen anything quite like it.
Some are gleeful about what's going on, but many others are saddened by it. Many at NBC News are scared.
Fundamentally the network now faces a wretched business calculation: Is Williams -- the No. 1 news anchor in the United States -- too damaged to continue in the job? And are NBC's ratings and profits better off with him or without him?
To be clear, this is not what I'm asking. This is what NBC News officials are asking. In fact, they'd be derelict not to be asking.
The president of NBC News is Deborah Turness. Her boss is Pat Fili-Krushel, the chair of the NBCUniversal News Group, which also includes MSNBC and CNBC. Fili-Krushel reports to NBCUniversal CEO Steve Burke.
The trio of executives have said nothing publicly since Friday, when Turness confirmed that an internal fact-checking investigation was underway.
But this crisis is taking up all of their time. Politico reported that Burke held a meeting at his home on Sunday about it.
On Monday, the preliminary Nielsen ratings for last week's ""Nightly News"" came in, and they suggested further trouble.
Williams had been beating his main competitor, ABC's David Muir, all week, including Thursday, the day after Williams apologized on-air.
But on Friday, once the scandal had become a bigger national news story, Muir won by more than 300,000 viewers ages 25 to 54, the key demographic, and almost 500,000 total viewers.
Such a dramatic day-to-day swing is highly unusual in network news.
So will NBC executives make a decision about Williams' future ""based on the entirety of his career and not only one or two or three mistakes,"" as MSNBC's Joe Scarborough put it on Monday?
Or are the mistakes -- some are calling them lies -- and the resulting ratings trouble enough to end his career?
I've been talking to players on all sides and at all rungs of the industry's ladder, from anchors and presidents to associate producers. Everyone has an opinion, some more cynical than others. Everyone agrees Williams and NBC News have been hurt by his embellishments. Williams agrees too -- that's why he profusely apologized to his colleagues on Friday, and is said to be eager to speak more. Here's where people disagree:

Some say Williams has been telling tall tales for years, and it's finally caught up with him.
They say NBC has to replace him right away, the sooner the better, to stem the proverbial bleeding.
They think there's no way viewers will take him seriously anymore, not after #BrianWilliamsMisremembers became a trending topic.
Is there some schadenfreude and television back-stabbing going on here? Sure there is. Pains at NBC could pretty quickly translate to gains at ABC and CBS, its two big rivals in network news.
And as anyone in his position would, Williams has lots of detractors, just like he has lots of fans.
But the scrutiny is legitimate. It's rooted in something real, not just in wishful thinking from NBC's competitors.
Related: What we know about the controversy
Maureen Dowd of The New York Times wrote on Sunday: ""NBC executives were warned a year ago that Brian Williams was constantly inflating his biography.""
David Carr, also of The Times, wrote on Monday, ""Those of us who worked the Hurricane Katrina coverage rolled our eyes at some of the stories Mr. Williams told of the mayhem there.""
While NBC conducts its own internal fact-checking exercise, journalists from many other news outlets are looking for other discrepancies in Williams' past reports.
Some television critics have even started to call for Williams' resignation.
""There is no way to contain the damage. No way to continue. No way out,"" Newsday's Verne Gay wrote, adding, ""It's all over but the press release.""
One of my sources at NBC, who called Williams ""too big to fail"" on Thursday, took that back over the weekend and acknowledged it's now possible that he may be forced out.

Others say Williams is in trouble, but NBC should stand by him and let him regain trust.
These people -- including some at other networks -- are disturbed by the trial-by-Twitter that has enveloped Williams. They hope he can stage a comeback.
""I feel sad about Brian Williams,"" former CNN host Larry King tweeted on Sunday night.
Here's an important point: some TV anchors and executives are wondering what would happen if others' resumes and talk-show appearances were scrutinized the same way.
There's lots of talk about second chances and the benefit of the doubt.
MSNBC's Willie Geist said Monday that viewers ""have every right if they don't want to watch him anymore, that's their right. But... I think we should look at the totality of the man"" as well as the current controversy about misstatements.
That sentiment can be found all over the ""Nightly News"" Facebook page, too. ""Not watching until Brian is back,"" wrote one commenter. ""Tuning out until NBC grows a spine and backs Brian,"" wrote another. Some of these fans say they're tired of ""witch-hunts.""

So what's going to happen? No one knows.
On my CNN program ""Reliable Sources,"" I asked two veteran TV journalists -- Jeff Greenfield and Frank Sesno -- if Williams will return to the chair, and their answers were refreshingly blunt.
""We don't know,"" Sesno said. ""It depends where this investigation leads. It's just too much up in the air right now.""
Indeed, whether NBC has the stomach for all of this is an open question. The network has invested tens of millions of dollars in Williams.
It just renewed his contract last December -- he's set to be the ""Nightly News"" anchor for almost the rest of the decade. Before this scandal, his newscast was No. 1 in the ratings among both total viewers and 25- to 54-year-olds (although not as firmly No. 1 as it's been in the past).
But the current controversy now gets added to a long list of other challenges for the news division.
Burke, the NBCUniversal CEO, must have cringed at this Politico headline on Friday: ""The decline and fall of NBC News.""
Burke reports to Brian Roberts, the CEO of NBC's parent company Comcast (CCV). Roberts has a lot on his plate, including a pending merger with Time Warner Cable (TWC). I've known him to be the type of guy who hates distractions and controversies. He appreciates NBC News but he doesn't want it to embarrass him or his company.
Right now, this is embarrassing."
2015-02-03 11:11:02,"Croatia wipes out debts for 60,000 people - Feb. 3, 2015 ",http://money.cnn.com/2015/02/03/pf/debt-forgiveness-croatia/index.html,"Imagine meeting a fairy godmother that made all your debt disappear. (Bippity boppity boop!)
This fairy-tale scenario is set to become a reality for about 60,000 low-income Croatians who have been struggling to pay their bills.
The Croatian government, acting in place of a fairy godmother, has launched a program called ""Fresh Start"" that will cancel the debt owed by some of the poorest people in the country.
The state, alongside a number of banks, telecom operators, electricity companies, local governments and other firms, have collectively agreed to forgive debt worth up to 60,000 Croatian kuna ($8,830) per individual.
Croatia's economy is in the midst of a prolonged recession, with gross domestic product declining every quarter since the end of 2011.
This measure is expected to boost consumer confidence and spending.
Related: Aussie chocolate bars are getting smaller
The program is designed specifically for households that made less than 2,500 kuna ($370) over the last three months and meet other financial criteria.
""This is for the bottom layer of debtors where there is clearly no chance that they will ever repay the debts that they have,"" said Otilia Dhand, a political analyst at Teneo Intelligence.
The government noted that it has never had a debt forgiveness program of this magnitude, but said this is a one-off initiative.
Dhand says the move was not a surprise since the government has recently lost support in the polls. She said this will give the government a popularity boost ahead of parliamentary elections, which are expected by the end of February 2016.
The International Monetary Fund has recommended a laundry list of reforms and overhauls to get the Croatian economy back on track. In November, it said it supported the idea of writing off debt for distressed households."
2015-02-05 11:22:03,"Illegal ways people are nabbing bigger tax credits - Feb. 5, 2015 ",http://money.cnn.com/2015/02/05/pf/taxes/tax-credit/index.html,"Most people who want to cheat on their taxes will do anything they can to understate their income. After all, the more you make, the more you'll likely to owe.
But there's at least one scam where an unscrupulous tax preparer will try to inflate a clients' income, the IRS said.
Here's why: Some people make too little to owe any federal income taxes, but may still qualify for a refund by claiming certain refundable credits, like the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC).
To make sure their client gets the maximum amount, some tax preparers will report that they earned more than they actually did.
For instance, a couple with two kids who earned between $13,650 and $23,300 in 2014 wouldn't owe any federal income taxes but could get a maximum of $5,460 from the EITC, said Mark Luscombe, principal federal tax analyst for tax publisher Wolters Kluwer, CCH.
But if they earned less than $13,650, they wouldn't get that maximum refund amount, Luscombe said.
Related: Beware promises of 'outlandish' refunds
So by falsely inflating their income to, say, $14,000, they could qualify for the full $5,460.
Another credit where it may be possible to carry out this type of scam is the refundable portion of the Child Tax Credit, Luscombe said. That refundable portion is also tied to earned income and is intended to help offset the cost of raising children for the lowest income families.
What does the tax preparer get out of the deception? A bigger fee. Typically such preparers will take their fee out of the refund.
And the bigger the refund, the bigger the potential fee.
But if they're caught, the low-income couple will be on the hook. Everyone is legally responsible for what's on their tax return, regardless of who prepared it. Ramifications include having to repay the erroneous refund, including interest and penalties, the IRS said."
2015-02-25 05:27:46,"What does net neutrality mean for you? - Feb. 25, 2015 ",http://money.cnn.com/2015/02/25/technology/net-neutrality-fcc/index.html,"On Thursday, the FCC approved new rules that -- depending on which side you believe -- either ensure a fair Internet or smother it with unnecessary regulation.
The FCC's vote allows it to assert extra authority over the Internet to establish net neutrality. It's like equal opportunity for Internet speeds and access to websites. No unfair fast/slow lanes. No blocking of legal services on your phone, computer or tablet.
But hold off on celebrating or gasping in despair.
In reality, the world won't look any different on Friday -- or anytime soon. The biggest hopes and fears about regulators won't materialize. Netflix won't suddenly stream any faster for you. AT&T (T, Tech30) and Comcast (CMCSA) won't abruptly stop laying down high-speed fiber cables and investing in their networks as retaliation. And Netflix can still cut deals with broadband companies for faster access to a network.
Instead, the FCC rules won't be official until maybe summertime, and major telecom companies will challenge them in court. A long fight will follow that might stretch all the way until the next presidential administration.
And if a Republican wins the 2016 presidential election, then this could all fizzle away, and we're back at square one: a country without strong net neutrality rules.
Experts on both sides of this heated debate see this as a long fight that started long ago and isn't ending anytime soon.
Still, it's worth a quick recap over the two vastly different versions of this debate.
The pro-FCC regulation side demands strong net neutrality rules. AOL (AOL, Tech30), Facebook (FB, Tech30), Netflix (NFLX, Tech30), Twitter (TWTR, Tech30), Vimeo and every other major Internet company is on this list.
They create the content you read and watch online, and they don't want to face discrimination by network owners who can threaten to charge higher fees or slow them down.
To them, FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler's proposed rules sound promising. For example, Verizon can't block Google Wallet on your smartphone, like it did in 2011. Your phone carrier can't block tethering apps, which turn your phone into an Internet hotspot for your laptop or tablet. AT&T can't block video chatting apps like FaceTime or Google Hangouts. And Comcast can't slow down file-sharing websites, like it did to BitTorrent a few years ago.
The anti-FCC regulation side doesn't want additional rules, because the situations cited above were already resolved with the existing rules. AT&T, Comcast, Time Warner Cable (TWC), Verizon (VZ, Tech30) and other Internet service providers are on this side.
They own the networks and fear price controls. Fearing a bad business environment, AT&T has threatened to pause investment in its infrastructure.
Their big gripe with the FCC is that the agency will regulate Internet providers by scooping them up under Title II of the 1934 Telecommunications Act, a specific set of regulations that apply to phone companies. Telecoms say the rules don't match the services they provide. They don't trust the FCC's promise that it will apply only a tiny fraction of those rules.
So, for now, forget all this talk about the freedom of the Internet. This is going to be a long, boring fight about whether the FCC has the authority to regulate the Internet the way it wants to.
As Robert M. McDowell, a former FCC commissioner turned telecom lawyer in Washington, D.C. notes: ""The Internet has thrived in the absence of net neutrality rules, thank you very much.""
Republicans in Congress tried and failed to block the FCC from voting on the new regulations. But Congress itself is largely to blame for the new regulations. The only reason the FCC is getting creative with the rules is because the old ones don't work well with our new world of Internet-enabled mobile devices and data-heavy video streaming websites.
Congress could, theoretically, step in and establish rules about Internet fairness. Even the anti-regulation folks are for that.
But given the poisonous atmosphere on Capitol Hill ""it's not a practical alternative"" right now, said Former FCC Commissioner Michael Copps, a net neutrality supporter now with the populist advocacy group Common Cause.

2015-02-10 07:59:35,"Brian Williams suspended for 6 months - Feb. 10, 2015 ",http://money.cnn.com/2015/02/10/media/brian-williams-nbc-suspended/index.html,"""NBC Nightly News"" anchor Brian Williams is being suspended for six months without pay following revelations that he exaggerated tales from an Iraq War mission in 2003.
Tuesday night's announcement capped an extraordinary and painful six-day period for the network. Television veterans could recall nothing quite like it: a network benching the face of its news division to penalize him for what the CEO of NBCUniversal, Steve Burke, called ""inexcusable"" actions.
There is a widespread belief among rank-and-file NBC staffers that he may never actually return to the anchor chair he has held since 2004.
And if he does return, he'll return in a diminished capacity.
Related: Read NBC's statement about the suspension
Meanwhile, NBC's investigative unit is continuing to fact-check Williams' past reports, and could come up with more damaging revelations.
Still, Burke said in a statement, ""He deserves a second chance and we are rooting for him. Brian has shared his deep remorse with me and he is committed to winning back everyone's trust.""
Eight hours earlier, Williams visited Burke at the apartment Burke has on Central Park West in Manhattan. There, Tuesday evening's announcement began to take shape.
NBC News president Deborah Turness informed staffers of the network's suspension decision at a 7:15 p.m. meeting, held minutes after Williams' fill-in, Lester Holt, finished anchoring Tuesday's ""NBC Nightly News.""
""The suspension will be without pay and is effective immediately,"" Turness wrote in a memo.
Holt will continue to substitute-anchor the ""Nightly News."" An NBC source said Williams' name would likely be removed from the newscast's graphics later this week.
One rival executive speculated that NBC, by suspending Williams, was simply ""buying time for more negotiations"" that might lead to the anchor's exit.
Others, however, said it was quite possible he would stay put.
Within NBC News, shock about the announcement gave way to sadness and a general agreement that the news division is in the midst of its toughest period since the early 1990s, when journalistic lapses like a staged car accident for ""Dateline"" spurred soul-searching and management changes.
""I feel like I have just witnessed a sudden death,"" one longtime NBC News staffer said on condition of anonymity.
One NBC anchor called it ""humiliating for this whole network.""
Williams was, at least until last week, the single most popular news anchor in the United States. He reached about 10 million viewers a night. Just in December, NBC signed him to a new contract.
Several rival executives, speaking anonymously, said there was no joy to be had in Williams' befalling. ""Inside Edition"" host Deborah Norville said much the same thing on ""CNN Tonight.""
""There is no delight to be taken in this,"" Norville said, calling the blow to Williams' credibility ""also a blow for journalism.""
Related: Who is Lester Holt
For NBC News, the rolling calamity began last month when Williams paid tribute on his newscast to a soldier who had provided security to the anchor and his NBC crew in the desert on that day in 2003.
""The story actually started with a terrible moment a dozen years back during the invasion of Iraq when the helicopter we were traveling in was forced down after being hit by an R.P.G,"" Williams said on-air. ""Our traveling NBC News team was rescued, surrounded and kept alive by an armor mechanized platoon from the U.S. Army 3rd Infantry.""
Related: How Brian Williams' Iraq story changed
After a video of the segment was posted by the network on Facebook, several soldiers called out Williams for stretching the truth.
Williams, it turned out, had not been on the helicopter that was hit by an R.P.G.
Williams apologized last Wednesday, both on Facebook and on ""Nightly News,"" but what he said raised more questions than answers, and the controversy swelled over the next three days.
As skepticism mounted over Williams' claims about other reporting assignments -- namely his coverage of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 -- NBC News said Friday that it would conduct an internal investigation into the disputed accounts. Williams was once again in the anchor chair that night.
Related: Cronkite biographer on Brian Williams
But on Saturday, Williams said he had become ""too much a part of the news"" and that he planned to step aside from the newscast for ""the next several days."" Williams hunkered down even more on Sunday, canceling a scheduled appearance on the ""Late Show with David Letterman.""
By Monday, his attorney was in crisis meetings at 30 Rockefeller Center, where Williams' posters -- celebrating his first-place status in the nightly news wars -- hang on the walls.
Those meetings continued on Tuesday and ended with the suspension announcement.
On NBC's cable news channel MSNBC, Rachel Maddow covered the breaking news and told her viewers that ""NBC News will not make anyone available to discuss this story with us on the air.""
Over on Fox News, there were messages of support for Williams. Senior political analyst Brit Hume, a friend of Williams, told Megyn Kelly he hopes the embattled anchor pulls through this.
""I really like the guy, and I feel terrible for him tonight,"" Hume said.
""I think you speak for a lot of us,"" Kelly said.
The scribe who broke the news of Williams' recanted Iraq story last week said he wasn't celebrating the suspension.
""I don't get any satisfaction from seeing Brian Williams suspended,"" Stars and Stripes reporter Travis Tritten wrote on Twitter. ""Like the vets I spoke with, I just wanted to set the record straight."""
2015-02-10 02:58:34,"Hackers are stealing your tax refund - Feb. 10, 2015 ",http://money.cnn.com/2015/02/10/technology/security/hackers-tax-refund/index.html,"The recent slew of massive hacks are costing you money -- your U.S. government tax refund.
Last year alone, hackers stole more than 6.5 million Social Security numbers. The number of SSNs stolen this year might be significantly higher, given the recent Anthem hack of 80 million customers. (The company hasn't yet said how many SSNs were lost.)
Stolen SSNs are flooding online black markets -- and they're selling fast.
SSNs go for $3 to $5 when packaged with names and other personal information, according to several firms with undercover agents in those marketplaces. Fraudsters only need two ingredients required to pull off tax fraud: your name and SSN. Plug in some fake income numbers on a doctored W-2 form and voilÃ : They've filed taxes in your name and stolen your refund too.
Once someone claims your government check, good luck getting it back -- or claiming your next one. The IRS freezes your refunds, and investigations are so backed up, the government says the average wait time to clear up the matter is 120 days. Sometimes it takes years.
Tax fraud is older than the IRS. But in the past, fraudsters had to know someone on the inside -- crooked employees at schools, hospitals or banks willing to fork over documents, according to former federal prosecutor Jed Dwyer, now a white collar defense attorney in Miami.
Now, it just takes a few clicks.
""It's so much easier and less risky than drugs,"" Dwyer said. ""All you need is a computer and data,""
Did someone steal your tax refund? Share your story with CNN.
Pulling off the crime
Fraudsters prefer to use commonly available tax preparation software. Forms are quickly put together, so they can file dozens or hundreds in a single day. And it partially shields them from dealing directly with the IRS.
Clever fraudsters will only use SSNs in a specific state or zip code, in an attempt to not raise any alarms at the IRS, said Adam Tyler, an executive at CSID, which monitors those shady marketplaces.
As for cashing it in and sneaking away, that's easy too. The IRS will direct-deposit the money to whatever bank account number you provide. And that includes nearly untraceable prepaid debit cards -- the throwaway kind you buy at gas stations.
It's a federal policy meant to help those too poor for a bank account avoid expensive check cashing fees. But this has become the number one way for criminals to take the money and run, according to several former prosecutors who investigated these cases with the U.S. Department of Justice's tax division until 2014.
""The fraudster is gone in the wind by the time anyone looks for them,"" said former prosecutor Justin Gelfand, calling these government policies ""completely incompetent.""
The IRS fraud controls are working -- but not well enough.
Between 2011 and 2014, the IRS spotted and halted $63 billion worth of fraudulent tax refunds. But the IRS paid identity thieves $5.2 billion in 2011 alone.
Starting this year, the IRS will not load more than three tax refunds onto a single prepaid debit card. That just means criminals will now have to split up their loot onto several different cards.
The agency also has automated fraud filters, which record the IP address of the computer you use to electronically file your taxes, Dwyer said. Alarms go off if dozens or hundreds of people's taxes get filed from the same spot.
But the IRS won't stop you from filing your taxes in Miami if you live in Seattle. After all, people move. Also, you can file a tax return with wildly different income from last year. After all, people get new jobs.
And the most glaring issue is a calendar flaw. You can file your taxes as soon as you get your W-2 from your employer around late January. But businesses don't need to send that documentation to the IRS until late spring. Therefore, there's a gap -- roughly February to June -- where fraudsters can file bogus numbers that the IRS can't verify until it's too late.
It's a gap that IRS Commissioner John Koskinen wants to close, but it'll take legislation from Congress to do it.
The IRS also wants to update its website to require a password when filing taxes to make sure you're you. The closest thing to that extra security now is a six-digit PIN -- but that option is only available to tax fraud victims and residents of Florida, Georgia and Washington. The agency wants to take this pilot program nationwide, but it faces a $200 million cut to its technology budget this year.
Solutions
If you can, sign up for the extra PIN -- even if it's annoying to remember.
Meanwhile, there's no time like the present to file your taxes. The black market heats up for SSNs this time of year. And it's normal for hackers to sell the same SSN to several fraudsters at once, so hackers move fast. They know IRS refunds are essentially first come, first served.
""It's a race to file a false tax return,"" Gelfand said. ""It's almost to the point that every year it starts in January.""

In interviews, O'Reilly said the story was a ""giant piece of defamation,"" ""a lie,"" and a smear. He called one of the writers, David Corn, a ""disgusting piece of garbage,"" a ""guttersnipe liar,"" and a ""far-leftÂ assassin.""
Corn, the Washington bureau chief for Mother Jones, told CNNMoney that O'Reilly was resorting to ad-hominem attacks to distract from the substance of his report, which he co-authored with Daniel Schulman.
""There's an undeniable contradiction"" in what O'Reilly has said about his Falklands coverage, Corn said, urging reporters to focus on that part of the story.
The back-and-forth comes two weeks after ""NBC Nightly News"" anchor Brian Williams apologized for misstating his experience on an Iraq War mission in 2003. Williams was later suspended amid further scrutiny of his claims; a fact-checking investigation is ongoing.
Related: Should Brian Williams be allowed back?
Williams was the #1 nightly news anchor; O'Reilly is the #1 nightly cable news host. But the similarities may stop there.
Fox orchestrated a full-throated response right away on Thursday; O'Reilly told TVNewser that he had ""talked to about eight or nine reporters.""
When asked for comment, a Fox News spokeswoman deferred to O'Reilly's other interviews.
Corn and Schulman's report detailed several times when O'Reilly said that he had spent time in a ""war zone"" while covering the Falklands conflict as a reporter for CBS News.Â
The problem, as CBS News's chief Washington correspondent Bob Schieffer explained to Mother Jones, is that the only ""war zone"" was in and around the islands, and ""nobody from CBS got to the Falklands.""Â
Schieffer, who was the network's lead correspondent covering the conflict at the time, said he ""came close"" to reaching the Falklands, but the task proved ""impossible."" He, O'Reilly and other reporters were based in Buenos Aires, Argentina.
Corn said Mother Jones started to piece together the report last week. It began to ask Fox News for comment on Thursday morning, and never heard back from O'Reilly or any of the network's representatives.
Shortly after its report was published on Thursday afternoon, however, O'Reilly condemned it in a series of interviews with other outlets. He insisted that everything he said about his coverage of the conflict was true.Â
""I was not on the Falkland Islands and I never said I was,"" O'Reilly told Politico. ""I was in Buenos Aires.""
The Mother Jones report highlighted an example from 2013, when O'Reilly recalled that he had been ""in a war zone in Argentina, in the Falklands.""
In another interview, this one with Mediaite, O'Reilly said his descriptions referred broadly to the story he was assigned to cover.
""If you were assigned to a war, you put on your resume you covered the Falklands, the Middle East, El Salvador, wherever it is where you were sent,"" he said. ""This is what journalists do.""
O'Reilly said he bore witness to a chaotic scene in Buenos Aires after the war -- something he called a ""combat situation.""
Corn told CNNMoney this was akin to ""saying that if you're in D.C. covering a protest during the Vietnam War, you were in Vietnam.""
Corn is a regular on cable news; he was a paid contributor to Fox News until 2008. He now has a similar position at Fox's rival MSNBC. He is perhaps best known for breaking the news about Mitt Romney's ""47 percent"" remarks.
O'Reilly asserted that Corn has been out to get Fox News for years. He said to TVNewser that he thought once reporters ""verify what I'm saying, because it's easily verifiable, then I expect David Corn to be in the kill zone.""
Corn said he thought the ""kill zone"" comment was intended to be threatening.

2015-02-20 07:26:08,"Why flying stinks, and you're still paying more - Feb. 20, 2015 ",http://money.cnn.com/2015/02/20/news/economy/airline-tickets-price/index.html,"Flying is rarely a pleasant experience anymore.
There's very little legroom, and a meal is seldom included. There are bag fees, change fees, fees to watch a movie -- not to mention the unpleasantness of going through security.
Yet even as services seem to decline, it costs more money to fly. From 2005 to 2013, ticket prices rose nearly 15% faster the rate of inflation, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation.
""We're paying more and getting less,"" said Charlie Leocha, head of the passenger advocacy group Travelers United. ""Consumers are clearly getting the short end of the stick.""
Much of the blame is placed on the wave of consolidations in the industry over the last decade. Twelve years ago, there were 10 major U.S. airlines. Now there are just four.
""Four carriers control 87% of the domestic market,"" said William Swelbar, a researcher with MIT's International Center for Air Transportation. ""That has given the airlines pricing traction, without question.""
Even in the face of falling oil prices, airlines haven't cut fares.
Related: Legroom -- how the airlines compare
Yet while this all seems like a raw deal for the average flier, the airlines say it's generally for the better.
For starters, the old model of cutthroat pricing and endless perks was unsustainable.
All the consolidations were largely the result of airlines going bankrupt -- and wiping out huge amounts of shareholder value and jobs. Between 2000 and 2009 U.S. airlines lost a combined $60 billion, said Swelbar. Over 160,000 people were laid off.
""Value destruction was the theme of the decade,"" he said.
What emerged is a more stable industry that's been better able to consolidate routes. While that might mean fewer daily flights out of smaller airports, regional hubs are now better connected to more cities -- both domestic and international -- than ever before.
""The payoff is global access,"" said Michael Boyd, a Denver-based aviation consultant.

The airline industry said the return to profitability has led to investment in new equipment that's actually improved services for fliers: New planes, new terminals, new runways, better software that doesn't lose your luggage as much.
""The U.S. carriers were notably behind the rest of the world in modernizing their fleets,"" said John Heimlich, chief economist at Airlines for America, the industry trade group. A new plane has better lighting, bigger overhead bins, more oxygen, and is more environmentally friendly.
And charging for all the things that used to be part of a standard ticket -- a pricing model the industry calls 'a la carte' -- means the person who just wants the cheapest fare doesn't have to pay for someone else's meal.
So keep that in mind the next time you're crammed in on a $500 commuter flight with no food."
2015-02-04 08:21:06,"Samsung's Galaxy S6 is coming March 1 - Feb. 4, 2015 ",http://money.cnn.com/2015/02/04/technology/mobile/samsung-galaxy-s6/index.html,"Samsung has sent out invitations for a March 1 ""Unpacked"" event, at which it is widely expected to unveil its new Samsung Galaxy S6 smartphone.
The wildly popular Galaxy S has been the flagship for Samsung's smartphone lineup for six years.
But as competition has increased, the Galaxy S's stranglehold on the Android market has weakened.
The company's profit slipped by 27% last quarter, largely due to slumping smartphone sales.
Even though Samsung (SSNLF) remains the top-selling smartphone maker in the world, the sales slump has reportedly served as a wake-up call for the company.
The Galaxy S6 is expected to be drastically different from the previous Galaxy S models. Samsung hasn't changed its flagship phone's design much since the 2012 Galaxy S3, and its look has gotten a bit stale.
Here are six things to expect Samsung to announce about the Galaxy S6 during its March 1 event in Barcelona.
1. Better design. Out with the plastic, in with the metal. The Galaxy S series has been bemoaned for its plastic shell, as most high-end smartphones now opt for fancier, shinier, more durable metal exteriors.
Samsung hears you. The company has taken up a new design principle called ""Project Zero,"" signifying a fresh start for the oft-criticized (but well-selling) smartphone. A hint of what could be coming can be found in the well-regarded Galaxy A5, a metal version of the Galaxy S4.
But beyond the materials Samsung is likely to use, the phone is also expected to look more modern, including a super-thin bezel, that makes the screen appear to go edge to edge.
2. Better software. Samsung includes a lot of useless software in its phones, including unnecessary app stores and redundant voice controls. With the Galaxy S6, Samsung is expected to make a lot of its add-on software an optional download, freeing up your phone for the stuff that you actually want to use.
3. Color variety ... except for black. Dark blue, blue-green, gold and white are the rumored colors for the new Galaxy S6. Want a black phone? Get an iPhone.
Related: A smart necklace from Samsung? Really?
4. Phone with an ""Edge."" The invitation that Samsung sent has a conspicuous curve in it. Could it be the rumored Galaxy S Edge?
Samsung is expected to unveil a smaller version of its oddball Galaxy Note Edge, which features a small portion of curved glass that bends around the right side of the phone. That tiny curve on the Edge's display functions as a second screen. It can display a list of apps, quick settings, notifications, weather and the time. It also serves as a stopwatch, timer, health tracker, Twitter feed and even a ruler.
If it's anything like the Galaxy Note Edge, the Galaxy S Edge will be identical to the Galaxy S6 -- except for the curved screen.
5. Not the latest chip. During its latest quarterly financial report, chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM, Tech30) said its new, latest/greatest Snapdragon 810 chip has lost a major customer -- widely believed to be Samsung.
Galaxy S phones almost always feature the most powerful smartphone processor on the market. But Qualcomm has had overheating issues with its 810 chip, and Samsung likely didn't want to risk including it in its newest flagship phone.
6. April release date. The Galaxy S5 was announced at the same event in Barcelona last year, and it went on sale in April. Though some analysts expect a late-March release date, April seems like the safest bet.

2015-02-18 10:03:17,"CNN/ORC poll: 52% say Brian Williams should be allowed back on 'NBC Nightly News' - Feb. 18, 2015 ",http://money.cnn.com/2015/02/18/media/cnn-poll-brian-williams-nbc/index.html,"A new CNN/ORC poll shows a sharp divide in the country's reactions to Brian Williams' six-month suspension from ""NBC Nightly News.""
A slim majority, 52% of respondents, said NBC News should allow Williams to return to his anchor chair. But 40% said the network should not.
The poll results show a generally forgiving attitude among Americans. But the 4 in 10 who say Williams should not be allowed back on ""Nightly News"" signifies a serious problem for NBC moving forward.
Substitute anchor Lester Holt has retained most of Williams' audience so far. Last week he beat ABC's David Muir. If that continues, six months from now, NBC may conclude that reinstating Williams is too risky.
Only 8% of respondents said they had no opinion on the matter, perhaps reflecting the widespread coverage of Williams' February 4 apology (for exaggerating his involvement in a 2003 Iraq War mission) and the media's subsequent scrutiny of other stories he has told.
As new questions piled up, and NBC launched a fact-checking investigation, Williams stepped aside for several days.
Then on February 10, NBC suspended him without pay for six months, raising the possibility that the network has found other examples of exaggerations that further harm Williams' credibility.
The network has declined to comment, citing the fact that the investigation is ongoing.
In the meantime, Williams has become a punchline in some quarters -- on NBC's ""Saturday Night Live"" anniversary show on Sunday night, the actor Jim Carrey asked an unamused Matt Lauer, ""Where are you hiding Brian Williams? Where is he?""
In the CNN/ORC poll, women were slightly more apt to offer Williams a second chance -- 55% of women said he should be allowed to return, and 49% of men said the same.
Republican criticism of the mainstream media was also evident in the poll results: 58% of Democrats said Williams should be allowed to return to ""NBC Nightly News,"" versus 45% of Republicans.
The CNN/ORC International poll was conducted February 12-15, and interviewed 1,027 adult Americans. Results for all adults have a sampling error of plus or minus 3 points.
The poll results bear several similarities to research published over the weekend by Magid Associates, a television consulting firm.
In Magid's research, 44% of respondents said they thought NBC's punishment was ""just right."" Another 30% called it ""too strong,"" and only 9% said it was ""too weak.""
All of those surveyed by Magid said they tuned in for a nightly newscast at least once a month.
Almost half -- 48% -- said they thought Williams can restore his credibility, 30% said Williams cannot regain credibility, and 22% said they were unsure.

2014-08-18 08:02:12,"Average cost of raising a child hits $245,000 - Aug. 18, 2014 ",http://money.cnn.com/2014/08/18/pf/child-cost/index.html,"New parents be warned: It could cost nearly a quarter of a million dollars to raise your child -- and that's not even including the cost of college.
To raise a child born in 2013 to the age of 18, it will cost a middle-income couple just over $245,000, according to newly released estimates from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. That's up $4,260, or almost 2%, from the year before.
Estimates can vary widely depending on where you live and how much you earn.
High-income families who live in the urban Northeast, for example, are projected to spend nearly $455,000 to raise their child to the age of 18, while low-income rural families will spend much less, an estimated $145,500, according to the report.
The figures are based on the cost of housing, food, transportation, clothing, health care, education, child care and miscellaneous expenses, like haircuts and cell phones. But the estimates don't include the cost of college -- a big-ticket expense that keeps rising.
The good news: overall costs have grown more slowly in recent years thanks to low inflation, said economist Mark Lino, who has written the annual report for the USDA since 1987.
But many families are still having to do more with less. The country's median income remains more than 8% below where it was before the recession, while child care and health care costs continue to grow faster than inflation.
Related: 'The most surprising cost of raising my kid'
Child care, in particular, is a huge burden -- often costing as much as the family home.
In 2012, center-based care for one infant was greater than median rent payments in nearly half of the states, according to Child Care Aware of America's most recent report.
In Seattle, Britta Gidican and her boyfriend spend $1,380 each month on daycare for their 17-month-old son, just $20 less than they spend on their mortgage each month.
""When I was pregnant I knew daycare would be expensive,"" said Gidican, a public relations manager. ""But I didn't expect to pay two mortgages.""
Rising transportation and food costs are also eating up a big chunk of family budgets. Gas prices have nearly doubled since 2004, according to the AAA. Meanwhile, food prices have increased more than 13% since 2008, according to the USDA, and make up the third biggest child-rearing expense in the agency's estimate.

Kim Blackham, a mother of four and part-time marriage and family therapist, says she has seen her grocery bill climb dramatically in the past decade. Today, she and her husband spend around $1,000 each month, in part because of her son's food allergies and her efforts to cook healthier meals for her family.
""I used to coupon shop, but the problem with coupons is that they are all for processed items,"" she said. ""You seldom see a coupon for fresh fruit or meat.""
For families trying to get by, here are some ways to ease the sting:
Use your community: From fancy strollers to bike seats, Boulder, Colo. mother-of-two Kate Lacroix said she has found a large community of people willing to share their hand-me-downs.
""There is a real economy of scale when you use the village,"" she said.
Try looking on local parenting blogs or websites to find everything from free baby clothes to a family looking to share a nanny.
Calculator: Cost of living: How far will my salary go?
Take advantage of tax credits: Many employers offer tax-advantaged accounts that let parents pay for health and child care expenses with before-tax dollars.
Taking advantage of these accounts, and other child-related tax credits, can help you save thousands of dollars come tax time, said Bob Gavlak, a wealth advisor with Strategic Wealth Partners in Independence, Ohio.
Plan (and save) ahead: When possible, expectant parents should prepare for the added costs ahead of time, said Matt Becker, a financial planner who specializes in working with new parents.
First, estimate your child-related expenses and then try to save that amount each month. By the time your child is born, you'll be used to living without that money and also have a sizable savings built up.
""Having a baby is a huge life change. You are going to have unexpected things come up,"" said Becker, founder of planning firm Mom and Dad Money. ""Having that extra savings can help a lot."""

So, while Census Bureau data says the average woman working full time made nearly 22% less than her male counterpart in 2013, or 78.3 cents on every dollar, that doesn't mean that all women get paid less to do the exact same job as men.

But there is research that does indicate a discrepancy.
A study from the American Association of University Women that controlled for college major, occupation, age, geographical region, hours worked and more, showed there is still a 7% wage gap between male and female college grads a year after graduation.
""We reviewed men and women who have made exactly the same education and career choices and still found a gap,"" said Lisa Maatz, vice president of government relations at the AAUW.
The trend is particularly troublesome given that mothers are the primary breadwinners in 40% of U.S. households with children, according to a 2013 Pew Research Center report.
Some blame the pay gap on womens' career choices and family demands. Others fault workplace discrimination, or women's reluctance to negotiate for pay and promotions.
To make pay more equal, Maatz said society needs to add more value to ""pink-collar jobs"" that tend to be low-paying.

The 78 cent wage gap is an improvement, according to the Census Bureau, up from 76.5 cents in 2012.
But the increase could have more to do with the decline of men in the labor force than gain for women.
""Men ages 25-34 have seen their wages fall 20% since 1980,"" said Kim Parker, director of social trends research at the Pew Research Center. ""So while there's been some wage improvement for women, the fall for men has been more significant [on closing the gap].""

Of the most traveled private jet routes in 2013, seven out of the top 10 were flown either in or out of New York, according to Knight Frank's Wealth Report.
While jet setters were jumping in and out of the big apple most often, the report found that the most popular route was the trip from Moscow to the Cote d'Azur in the south of France.
The ranking of routes is based on data from NetJets, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA) that allows customers to charter or partially own private planes.
About 60% of private jet traffic starts and ends in the U.S., the report showed, mostly centered around New York, Miami and Palm Beach. Europe follows, with customers mostly traveling between London, the south of France and Moscow. The Middle East is the third-largest market. Once China relaxes its regulations around private aviation, the report's authors expect traffic to explode in the region.
Related: Why flying stinks and you're still paying more
When it comes to what routes were fastest growing in 2013, the list gets a bit more unexpected. The fasted growing route was from the Cote d'Azur to New York, followed by Maiquetia, Venezuela, to Miami.
According to Liam Bailey, Knight Frank's global head of research, there's an obvious strong link between major business hubs. But the link between New York and the south of France has more to do with Russian business owners mixing business with pleasure.
""There are so many Russians who own properties in the south of France who frequently travel to the U.S. and London for business,"" he said.
But these flight routes are gaining popularity mostly due to the continued internationalization of business, according to Marine Eugene, executive director of NetJets Europe.
""We're seeing air crafts really go around the globe,"" she said. ""The long-range activity has been really resilient.""
Related: Fly business class to London for 50% less
Houston is a standout on the list, showing up in four out of the top 10 fastest-growing routes.
Wheels Up, another company that allows customers to rent out seats on private planes, is also experiencing hyper-growth in the Texas market, said Kenny Dichter, founder and CEO. They currently have four planes stationed in Texas to meet demand, but they plan to add more in 2015.
Dichter said that most of the flights out of Texas are for business purposes, not leisure. And about half of private fliers are people who've switched over from commercial flights.
""With reasonable hourly rates, it's created a value proposition that's moved people off their commercial options and onto private,"" he said.
Wheels Up is also seeing a lot of growth in quick commuter routes, like New York to Boston or D.C., or within Texas. Dichter explained that's because commercial tickets for these short flights can often skyrocket to close to $1,000, especially on short notice.
""When prices approach those levels, business people who are traveling with three or four colleagues start say, why wouldn't we fly private for close to the same price?"" he said. ""It saves on airport time, plus the flights have WiFi so they're connected.""
Not included on the fastest-growing list, but still experiencing huge demand, were sunny and snowy vacation destinations in Europe. According to the Knight Frank report, Ibiza saw a 17% increase in traffic over 2013, with similar increases to places like the Maldives and the Seychelles. Trips to ski towns like Verbier, St. Moritz and Courchevel also saw high levels of growth.
While the data is for 2013, NetJets' Eugene said that the fastest-growing list pretty much holds, with one exception: Travel to and from Russia has taken a hit since this summer, when the crisis with Ukraine heated up. Since then, the market there has seen a 15% decline in traffic to and from the country."

Latin America is China's latest business buddy. Chinese banks increased investments in Latin America by 71% last year, and the country plans to double its trade volume with the Central and South American region over the next decade.
This comes as U.S. power in the Americas is starting to erode. U.S. cash is actually fleeing the region as investors see better deals at home or elsewhere.
China doesn't appear as worried about the short-term.
""What we're looking at is not simply an economic play. It's an economic play that also has political and strategic undertones,"" says Ilan Berman, vice president of the American Foreign Policy Council in Washington.
Outside of economic ties, Berman points out that China has helped fund Argentina's nuclear power plant, launched Bolivia's first satellite and is rumored to be helping Venezuela start its own drone program.
But for now, the relationship is mostly economic.

Related: Five reasons why Venezuela may be the world's worst economy
Trading Places: Although America is still the No. 1 trade partner with Latin America, China is already beating it in some places. China is ahead of the U.S. in trade with Brazil, Argentina, Peru and Venezuela, according to M.I.T. data.
It's a win-win for China and Latin America for many reasons. China needs all of Latin America's abundant commodities, like oil and soybeans, while some Latin countries are desperate for cash, which China is happy to provide.
In a sign of the shifting alignments, Latin American countries formed an alliance in 2010 called CELAC (Community of Latin American and Caribbean States), which excludes the U.S. and Canada.
Two months ago, the CELAC countries held a big meeting. Instead of going to Washington, they went to Beijing for the first formal conference between China and the region.
Related: Brazil's scandalous boom to bust story
Of course, the new friendship isn't entirely sunny. Chinese and Latin American economies are slowing down. Demand for goods is declining in China, and Latin America is at the end of a commodity boom, straining ties.
But the potential for long-term ties is strong. China's President Xi Jinping has vowed to double trade between his country and Latin America over the next decade to $250 billion.
""China provides a source of financing and export markets without pressures to adhere to practices of transparency, open markets, and Western style democracy,"" says Evan Ellis, a Latin American expert and professor at the U.S. Army War College.
Venezuela is a good example. As the country's economy flounders -- some have even dubbed it the worst in the world -- China stepped in, lending the South American nation billions in exchange for oil.
The 2015 bargain: emerging market stocks

Money talks: China's banks lent $22 billion to Latin America last year. That's more than the World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank sent to the region combined, according to Margaret Myers, an expert at the Inter-American Dialogue, which is not associated with the bank.
""These countries have really welcomed China with open arms,"" says Myers.
Meanwhile, U.S. businesses are losing interest in Latin America. Direct investment from U.S. firms to Latin America has declined almost 20% since 2011, according to Commerce Department data.
Despite the recent Cuba announcement, Latin America remains low on America's policy priorities, some say. Its sleepy attention toward Latin America has allowed China to capitalize.
""As western capital retreats from Latin America...there's a vacuum there. Why wouldn't the Chinese want to fill that?"" says David Morton, an emerging market expert and chief equity strategist at Rocaton Investment Advisers.

We're all going to miss RadioShack. For most people it's a place to get batteries and random electronic components. But for me, the company's bankruptcy filing brings up memories of my week as a 10-year-old camper â€” at RadioShack ""Computer Camp.""
It was 1983 and I was learning Logo, an early graphic programming language known more commonly as ""turtle graphics."" The experience would ultimately help to spark a lifelong obsession and a two-decade career in digital design.
RadioShack: 94 years of hits and misses
Computers were on the brink of becoming mainstream, but were still cost prohibitive for most families to have in their homes. Then War Games came out and overnight Matthew Broderick somehow turned monitors and keyboards from unbearably nerdy into something a little less apt to get you teased in the school hallway. Geeks suddenly wanted to get in as much computing time as possible.
Radio Shack opened a handful of ""Computer Centers"" in addition to their more traditional stores. Ours was located on the main drag just a block away from the standard resistor/capacitor peddling Radio Shack.
The layout was really smart. The front was stocked with all kinds of eye candy -- the latest models of desktop machines, an uber-cool portable briefcase computer with a built-in rubber cup telephone modem and even a mini machine that fit in your pocket. It was the stuff of a 10-year-old's dreams.
""Camp"" was located in a small classroom in the very back of the store, so we'd have to salivate over the cutting-edge hardware on the way in, and again on the way out. The class featured two or three lines of desks, each holding five brand new TRS-80s. I really wanted to study BASIC, the layman's language of choice that could be used to create full programs and games, but didn't meet the age cutoff of 12 and ended up in turtle graphics.
Logo consisted of steering a ""turtle"" around the screen with simple commands like MOVE 200, causing it to walk forward 200 units. Then you could change the turtle's direction with something like TURN 90, resulting in a right turn. The real fun came when you added mathematical equations to create complex geometric shapes and fractals. It may seem archaic, but the underlying concepts are still used in many scalable vector formats today!
Pretty soon after my class, my family got a Commodore 64 and I got to delve into BASIC and graphic creation at home. The Radio Shack Computer Centers quickly faded away. And now 30 years later, so is a big chunk of the overall brand. Where will we go next time we need to buy a transistor in a hurry?

According to Nielsen, 49.8 million viewers tuned into Fox to witness Seattle's wild overtime win over the Green Bay Packers, 28-22, in the NFC championship.
Those numbers make the game the most-watched program on American television since Super Bowl XLVIII last year.
The game's madcap final minutes -- agonizing for Packers fans, energizing for Seahawks fans -- helped its audience peak at 59.6 million viewers as it went into overtime.
Keep in mind, Nielsen only counts viewers at home, not groups of people gathered at bars, restaurants and viewing parties.
Later in the day, over on CBS, 42.1 million viewers watched a more subdued AFC championship as the New England Patriots decimated the Indianapolis Colts 45-7.
The strong ratings for CBS came just hours after the network announced it would once again be the home for Thursday Night Football in 2015.
Overall, this weekend's conference championships averaged over 45 million viewers.
While high, these totals were down from the comparable week last year, when 55.9 million viewers watched the NFC championship and 51.3 million watched the AFC championship.
But they're up from the totals a year earlier, in 2013, when the NFC championship drew 42 million viewers and the AFC drew 47.7 million.
While a big ratings hit for Fox, this year's Seahawks' game also had an incredible social presence online.
Fans on social media followed along, almost dumbstruck, as the Seahawks somehow, someway erased a sixteen point halftime deficit to defeat the Packers.
""Based on my Twitter feed, this game should get a Nielsen rating of 'everyone,'"" tweeted Brent Weinstein, head of digital media at United Talent Agency.
While the audience wasn't everyone, the NFC Championship did result in 358 million Twitter impressions.
The last minute heroics of Seattle are a great example of why the league's games have to be watched live, which is a rarity in today's delayed TV viewing world.
And the biggest broadcast of all is still to come: the Seahawks take on the Patriots in Super Bowl XLIX on NBC on February 1."
2015-01-16 06:28:39,"Meet the vigilante who hacks jihadists - Jan. 16, 2015 ",http://money.cnn.com/2015/01/16/technology/security/jester-hacker-vigilante/index.html,"Anonymous isn't doing anything new by hacking Islamic extremist websites. A mysterious figure known as ""The Jester"" has been at it for five years.
Jester has single-handedly taken down dozens of websites that, he deems, support jihadist propaganda and recruitment efforts. He stopped counting at 179.
To some, he's an Internet superhero. Think Batman, with all the vengeance-laden moral qualms of vigilantism included.
""I realized something needed to be done about online radicalization and 'grooming' of wannabe jihadis, and we didn't have mechanisms to deal with it,"" Jester said in an interview with CNNMoney. ""I decided to start disrupting them.""
Little is actually known about Jester, other than his public persona on Twitter as @th3j35t3r: He is unapologetic, unabashedly pro-America and full of military jargon.
Jester first appeared on Twitter on Dec. 19, 2009. Since then, he's used his computer hacking skills to shut down, deface or expose anything he considers threatening to the United States -- especially if it endangers soldiers. If a legitimate company is hosting the site, it usually gets a brief warning before he attacks.
Consider his one-man operation on June 18, 2014. It was a Wednesday evening and out of the blue, Jester sent a public message via Twitter to GloboTech Communications, a company in eastern Canada that hosts websites.
""You are hosting fajer.info... which provides material support (inc mobile apps) to #ISIS terrorists,"" he warned, identifying a specific computer server.
At 9:19 p.m., Jester followed up with his signature threat: ""I respectfully urge u to review my last 2 tweets. U should take action, or if you prefer, I can. #30mins #TickTock""
Half an hour later, the jihadist website was knocked offline, and Jester delivered his catchphrase: ""TANGO DOWN.""
Related: Anonymous blocks jihadist website in retaliation for Charlie Hebdo attack
Five years of this has made him something of an Internet celebrity. Fans buy hats and T-shirts sporting his jester face logo or catchphrase. He has racked up nearly 58,000 followers on Twitter. His laptop is on display at the The International Spy Museum in Washington, D.C.
In late December, he retired his public persona and got showered with warm wishes and farewells. It didn't last long.
The deadly attack on the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, which was planned by the group ""Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula,"" brought Jester back out from the shadows.
This past Saturday, he hacked into The Global Islamic Media Front, a jihadist website that provides digital tools and teaches terrorists how to communicate privately. Jester defaced the website by planting two images of Charlie Hebdo covers -- one showing Mohammed (images of whom are extremely offensive to Muslims) and the other showing a Muslim man kissing a magazine cartoonist.
""The aim was to push it out there and give them a black eye,"" he said. ""I'll be ramping up more 'offensive countermeasures' over the coming days/weeks.""
Jester wouldn't say what, exactly, he has in mind. But if he sticks to his usual game plan, he'll target smaller jihadist sites. When people shift to the few, well-known jihadist forums, he's ""herding them into a smaller space, and therefore making them easier to monitor.""
He says he operates without the official approval of any U.S. government agency. But while Jester attacks jihadist sites, he says he quietly steals a bunch of information on visitors and site administrators and secretly passes the data on to his contacts at U.S. intelligence agencies.
So, if he's Batman, who's his Commissioner Gordon?
""Nicely put... sadly, I'll decline to comment,"" he said.
Jester's origin story: He says he spent five years as a U.S. soldier fighting in Afghanistan. His former job, testing computer servers and beefing up their security, taught him the necessary skills. He has a desk job now in the cybersecurity and intelligence field.
He adopted the name ""Jester,"" because it's a common enough Internet moniker that he thought it could better hide his true identity among ""too many false positives.""
But make no mistake: His vigilantism is illegal under U.S. laws. And the fact that he hasn't yet been hunted down and arrested says a lot about federal prosecutors and the FBI. Several cybersecurity experts see it as tacit approval.
On one hand, his personal crusade makes him little different from members of Anonymous. Last week, Anonymous blocked a jihadist website in retaliation for the Charlie Hebdo attack.
The difference is that Anonymous is a worldwide, ragtag group driven by various ideologies and rules. Jester sticks to one, patriotic mission: U.S. enemies only. But the definition is up to him. In 2010, he temporarily blocked Wikileaks. In August, he took down the website of PlayStation hackers Lizard Squad.
""I answer to my conscience, and to God, sir,"" he said. ""That's about it. I think my actions speak loudly enough of my principles and doctrine.""

If you've seen this year's list of Super Bowl advertisers, you might be questioning exactly what Wix is.
But while tech companies like Wix aren't quite household names, they've been betting big on Super Bowl ads for decades.
Most famously, Apple (AAPL, Tech30) did so with its 1984 Super Bowl Ad.
""It was an insane success,"" said Kelly O'Keefe, professor of brand strategy at the Virginia Commonwealth University Brand Center.
In those days, Apple was hardly the Goliath it is today. The company had gone public just four years prior. And its Super Bowl ad introduced the Macintosh, its first mass-market personal computer, to the world.
Directed by Ridley Scott, Apple's ad made the American event one of the year's biggest advertising stages and led to increased production values across the board.
Related: Victoria's Secret supermodels in Super Bowl gear
Wix is hoping to take a play from Apple's book -- and make a name for its brand with the 100 million people watching the Super Bowl.
Founded in Israel in 2006, Wix lets businesses and individuals build their own websites -- no coding experience required. It has 900 employees, 58 million registered users (80% of whom are small business owners) and offers its services in 11 languages.
Like Apple, Wix (WIX) is entering the Super Bowl after a recent IPO: It went public in November 2013.
In its Super Bowl debut, Wix features legends Brett Favre, Terrell Owens, Emmitt Smith, Larry Allen and Franco Harris. The former NFL stars use Wix to get their dream businesses online as part of its ""#ItsThatEasy"" campaign.
The stakes are high: Super Bowl ads cost $4.5 million, not including other costs like production, and talent, according to O'Keefe. (Wix declined to disclose what it spent on its Super Bowl campaign.)
Related: 25-year-old could earn $1 million from $80 ad
Coughing up money to secure a game day spot isn't nearly enough.
""In 1999 and 2000, we had a lot of tech companies who thought this was the recipe and many of those are not around anymore,"" said O'Keefe.
Wix has already rolled out nearly a dozen teaser videos on YouTube, its website and in a national TV campaign.
""We are updating and changing the campaign on a daily basis according to performance,"" said Chief Marketing Officer Omer Shai. ""This is the year that we're comfortable [taking] the brand to the next level.""
Apple's ad catapulted the company into the big leagues: within six hours of its 1984 broadcast, it captured $4.5 million in sales.
The Super Bowl helped other fledgling tech companies become recognizable names.
GoDaddy put itself on the map with its risque ads. In its 2005 debut, it satirized Janet Jackson's wardrobe malfunction from the year before. Monster.com's emotional 1999 ""When I Grow Up"" ad likewise made the site a go-to for job seekers.

""If you succeed, you succeed big. [But] there are as many failures as successes."" said O'Keefe.
That includes the now-defunct Outpost.com, an online electronics retailer, whose 1998 spot featured gerbils shooting out of a canon.
""All they talked about was the name [""Outpost""],"" said Derek Rucker, professor of marketing for Northwestern's Kellogg School of Management. ""While this certainly works for awareness, there's no follow-up message of why users should care, or what their point of differentiation is.""
Groupon's (GRPN) 2011 Super Bowl ad also fell flat in an attempt to make light of China's occupation of Tibet. Groupon later issued an apology and pulled its ad from airwaves.
""What a Super Bowl ad can do for a nouveau brand is give that awareness,"" said Rucker. ""It can have huge implications."""
2015-01-30 10:53:24,"NFL gets billions in subsidies from U.S. taxpayers - Jan. 30, 2015 ",http://money.cnn.com/2015/01/30/news/companies/nfl-taxpayers/index.html,"If you're a U.S. taxpayer then you're subsidizing the wildly profitable National Football League, regardless of whether you're a fan.
The NFL is the most profitable pro sports league in the U.S., raking in an estimated $1 billion in profits on $10.5 billion in revenue last season, figures that are sure to increase this year.
Those massive profits are made possible in part by the billions of taxpayer dollars that local governments spend on teams, coupled with tax breaks worth hundreds of millions for the teams, the league, their sponsors and fans.
""I've been studying this for 15 years, and I still can not believe cities and states are lined up begging to give money to these very profitable [teams],"" said Villanova professor Rick Eckstein, an expert on stadium finance.
Here's a rundown:
Stadium construction: Twenty new NFL stadiums have opened since 1997 with the help of $4.7 billion in taxpayer funds, according to an analysis by the advisory firm Conventions, Sports and Leisure. Local governments pony up to build these venues to attract or keep teams in their towns.
Two more stadiums now under construction in Minneapolis and Atlanta are being built with $700 million in government funds.
Taxpayers paid for most of the University of Phoenix Stadium, which opened in 2006 and is home to this Sunday's Super Bowl -- to the tune of about $300 million.
Teams even get tax breaks on the money they actually do spend on construction. Most of that spending is financed with tax free municipal bonds, which were originally created by Congress to help fund roads and schools.
Related: The high cost of being a football fan
A 2012 analysis by Bloomberg showed that U.S. sports teams will save $4 billion over the life of those bonds, with the NFL being the largest beneficiary. The owners of the Arizona Cardinals saved an estimated $125 million on the bonds issued to build the University of Phoenix Stadium.
Hidden help: The league also gets a financial boost in a less obvious ways, said Eckstein. Elected officials vying for a team to come to their town often serve up discounted city services, such as utilities or police patrolling a stadium on game day.
Teams also often get big breaks on their property taxes.
""There is a shift going on from obvious brick and mortar subsidy to more hidden, subtle form of subsidy,"" he said.
Related: NFL earns record profits despite ugly image
Tax breaks for the NFL's biggest customer: Corporate America: NFL teams sell between $1.5 billion to $2 billion worth of luxury and high-end club seats a year, according to Bill Dorsey, the chairman of the Association of Luxury Suite Directors. A single suite can cost as much as $750,000 a season. Almost all suites and club tickets are bought by corporate clients, which write the cost off as a business entertainment expense.
Related: This year's Super Bowl ads
Sponsors also spend about $190 million a year for the right to plaster a local venue with their logo, according to research firm IEG. Even when corporate names are hung on city-owned stadiums, the teams keep all those profits, not the cities. And companies can deduct all of those expenditures as marketing expenses.
Not for profit: The NFL's not for profit status strikes critics as particularly unseemly, given its financial might. But it's categorized that way because the league's profits are distributed to each of the teams, rather than kept by the league itself.
The league probably only saves about $10 million a year as a non-profit, according to Richard Phillips, research analyst with Citizens for Tax Justice, which is a rounding error for a league as profitable as the NFL."
2015-01-30 02:43:10,"Is $4.5 million for a Super Bowl ad worth it? - Jan. 30, 2015 ",http://money.cnn.com/2015/01/30/media/super-bowl-viral-ads/index.html,"Companies justify spending a whopping $4.5 million on a 30 second Super Bowl ad by touting how it's the one time you can reach more than 100 million people.
An added bonus? Those viewers aren't feverishly hitting the fast forward button on their DVR remote to zoom past commercials. For many, the ads are more important than the game.
But are we soon reaching the point where Super Bowl ads just won't make any economic sense? The price of a commercial keeps going up. Will it be any surprise if they reach $5 million next year or in 2017?
With that in mind, some companies may be able to ""win"" the Super Bowl marketing game with cheaper forms of advertising. Viral YouTube videos. Tweets and Facebook posts.
Oreo won the Super Bowl ... with a tweet. Remember how Oreo stole the thunder from all the TV commercials two years ago?
Shortly after a blackout hit the Superdome in New Orleans, Oreo tweeted the following message.
""Power out? No problem."" The tweet was accompanied by a photo of an Oreo with a caption that read ""You Can Still Dunk In The Dark""
Related: Check out a preview of some of this year's Super Bowl ads
Oreo actually had a Super Bowl ad that ran on TV that year. But good luck trying to remember it.
""Relevance is key. You need to make sure your brand is connecting and resonates. Oreo had the right message at the right time and it made complete sense."" said Francois Petavy, CEO of eYeka, an online crowdsourcing firm.
Band of brands. Tweets aren't the only way to get noticed. Newcastle Brown Ale had what many marketing experts felt was the best Super Bowl ad last year. But it wasn't a real ad.
Newcastle got Anna Kendrick to curse like a stevedore in an online video. The joke was that Newcastle promised to put her in a Super Bowl ad and then backed out because they didn't have the money to pay her.
It was a hilarious joke. Newcastle is not some microbrew with no marketing budget. It's owned by Heineken (HEINY). It just isn't allowed to advertise during the Super Bowl because Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD) holds the exclusive rights for Super Bowl beer commercials.
Newcastle is at it again this year.
It crowdsourced a viral commercial. The Kickstarter-esque ""Band of Brands"" features 37 sponsors, including Jockey underwear, Quilted Northern toilet paper and Match.com. Newcastle also produced a fake ad that it claimed it entered in the Doritos user-generated contest.
""Newcastle's ambush advertising is brilliant,"" said Michael Pavone, who runs the Pavone ad agency and has a site called SpotBowl.com that tracks the commercials on Super Bowl Sunday. ""Social media has changed the game.""
Advertise after the game. Companies are also experimenting with other ways to have Super Bowl advertisements ... that aren't running during the Super Bowl.
Shawn Prez, founder of Power Moves Inc., a marketing agency, noted that AllState's Esurance unit made a big splash last year by purchasing the first available Super Bowl ad after the game ended.
Esurance used the ad to run a contest. Since it was saving money by advertising after the game, it promised $1.5 million to a random viewer who tweeted #EsuranceSave30.
""That was really smart,"" Prez said.
Related: Is this the Super Bowl's next GoDaddy?
Some firms are also taking advantage of relationships they have with players in the game. Prez pointed out how blender maker Nutri Ninja got lucky. Nutri Ninja had New England Patriots wide receiver Julian Edleman in a YouTube video last year.
The Pats are in the Super Bowl and Edelman has gotten more attention for his play -- especially after he threw a touchdown pass in its game against the Ravens. So what did Nutri Ninja do? It had Edelman appear in a new video making smoothies with teammates.
Ads must be mix of ""old"" and ""new"" media. Of course, an ad during the Super Bowl can have a huge impact on a company. Pavone said that Apple (AAPL, Tech30), Master Lock and GoDaddy arguably wouldn't be where they are today without memorable Super Bowl commercials.
Related: Will the Super Bowl get record ratings?
But now that people are watching the commercials while also following reaction on their smartphones and tablets, it's not enough to just create 30 seconds for television.
""Companies need to do more. They have to take customers on a journey,"" said Jeff Rohrs, vice president of marketing insights for Salesforce (CRM, Tech30) Marketing Cloud. He said that just putting a hashtag for one second at the end of an ad is not sufficient.
According to a poll of more than 400 consumers by Salesforce, Rohrs estimates that nearly two-thirds of the Super Bowl viewers will also be using Facebook (FB, Tech30) while watching the game and that younger viewers will be most active on Twitter (TWTR, Tech30) and Snapchat.
So companies will probably continue to pay big bucks next year to advertise during Super Bowl 50. But you'll probably see a lot more cheaper guerilla marketing campaigns as well."

""Surveys show the average person loses an hour a day to disorganization,"" said Lisa Zaslow, a professional organizer in New York City. ""It takes much less time to get and stayed organized. Think about how frantic and stressed you are when you can't find something.""
Here's how experts suggest organizing your desk for maximum efficiency and productivity:
Get your layout right. Your monitor should be in front of you at eye-level and about 17-inches from your body, according to Zaslow.
Put frequently-used items, like the phone or supplies, on your dominant side to avoid having to reach across.
Mind your office supplies. Supplies used every day can go on the desk. Items used a couple times a week should go in a drawer under or to the side of a desk.
""Getting up even just once a day for a pencil or paper clip is shutting your brain off a project you are working on and you will have to come back and re-center,"" said Amy Trager, a professional organizer in Chicago.
It's also best to group like items together. ""All your office supplies should be kept together, not split up in multiple drawers,"" said Andrew Mellen, a professional organizer.
More Tips: You're organizing your closet all wrong
Go easy on reminders. When it comes to sticky notes, moderation is key.
Framing your monitor with notes isn't the most effective. ""They've lost their usefulness at that point,"" said Trager. Use them for important short-term reminders.
Don't go overboard with personal knick-knacks. Maintaining work-life balance is hard, especially on your desk. Family pictures, vacation souvenirs and other trinkets can provide positive feelings during the work day, but too many mementos can be a distraction.
""Our eyes pull every single thing in front of us and our brain processes it -- even if we don't realize it,"" explained Zaslow. A desk full of stuff means ""that is a lot of work and editing for you.""
She recommended keeping no more than three personal items on a desk.
Control your inbox. E-mail is a convenient way to communicate, but it can also be a major distraction.
If it becomes too much of a distraction, Trager recommended designating certain time periods throughout the day to check and respond to email. ""The rest of the time is for work.""
Also, don't be afraid to disable the pop-up notices of new mail if it interrupts work flow.
Related: Can't get any work done? Blame your noisy, crowded office
Embrace white space. Keep a paper-sized free space to your dominant side as a designated work space to make it easier to review or sign documents.
Prioritize your work flow. Only keep relevant and active projects and documents on your desk.
When work gets backed up, it's easy to get overwhelmed and stall productivity, so here's how Trager recommended grouping projects to prioritize:
1) Important and urgent
2) Urgent, but not necessarily important
3) Important, without urgency
4) Non-urgent, and not important
She added vertical file holders help avoid stacking folders on top of each other and overlooking the ones not on top.
Reassess frequently. Keeping a desk organized requires frequent upkeep and assessments, so be sure to take a weekly scan of your desk to make sure everything still deserves a spot on your work space.
""People don't even seen [the clutter], it has an impact but they are de-sensitized to it,"" said Mellen."
2015-02-15 01:50:32,"'Fifty Shades of Grey' finds love with record box office weekend - Feb. 15, 2015 ",http://money.cnn.com/2015/02/15/media/fifty-shades-of-grey-record-box-office/index.html,"The weather may be cold, but this weekend's box office was red hot thanks to ""Fifty Shades of Grey.""
Universal Pictures' erotic thriller set records at the cinema this weekend, hauling in $81.6 million over three days.
That makes ""Fifty Shades"" the biggest opening ever for a film on the combined Valentine's Day and Presidents Day weekend.
The box office love is expected to continue into Monday, which is a holiday for many people.
Industry analysts are projecting the film's four-day holiday haul to be roughly $90 million.
The film's $80 million three-day total crushed the previous record holder, the 2010 rom-com ""Valentine's Day,"" which brought in $63.1 million over four days.
""Fifty Shades"" also nearly broke another record. It came in just shy of 2004's ""Passion of the Christ,"" which opened to $83.9 million, the largest February opening of all time.
The sexy film starring Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan also had a huge Valentine's Day with it bringing in $36.7 million on Saturday alone.
This is the largest single-day box office gross in the history of February, which makes sense considering that the film was heavily marketed as a Valentine's Day rendezvous.
While the box office numbers were record breaking, audiences didn't take much pleasure in actually watching the film.
Movie-goers gave ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" a less than loving CinemaScore rating of C+."
2015-01-26 11:05:07,"Blizzard of 2015: Winners and losers - Jan. 26, 2015 ",http://money.cnn.com/2015/01/26/news/weather-blizzard-winners-losers/index.html,"When a blizzard strikes, it's not all fun and games with snowmen and sledding.
A major snowstorm can be a big disruption to the economy, leaving some buried in losses while creating opportunities for others.
""From a retailer perspective, it's devastating,"" said Britt Beemer, CEO at America's Research Group. Retailers lose 85% of their business, he estimates. If this week's big storm shuts down travel in the Northeast, it could have a $1 billion impact.
Here are some of the winners and losers when the flakes start swirling:
Winners:
--Snow removal: Salt and sand trucks often start rolling before a storm begins, and the cleanup effort lasts long after it's over. That means overtime pay for snowplow operators and others involved in clearing the roads.
--Diners and dives: Many restaurants and shops may be pulling down their shutters as the snow piles up. But snowplow operators need a place to stop for coffee and a warm meal, so those local 24-hour diners can live up to their name.
--Hardware stores and gas stations: Nothing sells shovels like a snowstorm. There's also a spike in interest for ice scrapers, sand, salt, snow blowers and gas to run them. This intensified demand sometimes leads to price gouging.
--Grocery stores: What is it about snowstorms that inspires people to stock up on bread and milk? Grocery stores do brisk business, which means long lines at the register and empty shelves for the procrastinators. Don't be surprised if the line at the nearby liquor store is also longer than usual, too. But the pre-storm spike is usually offset by a lull once the storm hits, and the overall picture is mostly a wash for grocery stores, Beemer said.
There are losers, too:
--Cities, towns and states: Hours of overtime is good news for snow plow operators, but someone has to foot the bill. Even a small storm can set back a town by hundreds of thousands of dollars, and a big one like this can tally in the millions. (New York, for example, puts 1,800 plows onto the city's streets.) Local governments also have to fuel and repair the trucks, fill them with salt and sand, and -- when it gets really bad -- deploy National Guard troops to rescue stranded people.
--Hourly workers: For every boss who urges employees to travel only if it's safe, there's another who pushes employees to come in. After all, someone needs to stock the shelves and run the register, especially if there's a spike in business due to the storm. But workers can't help it if they're snowed in or need to stay at home with the kids if school is canceled. Hourly workers don't get paid when they miss a shift, so that means they're out a day's pay.
--Victims of accidents: Slippery roads mean accidents -- ranging from multi-vehicle pileups to minor slips and falls on an icy sidewalk. Costs can pile up for car repairs and injuries.
--Theaters & restaurants: Many people just want to avoid the spills and accidents and stay home to watch a movie from the couch. But that also means they might have canceled a trip to the movie theater or to that fancy restaurant for the dinner they had planned.

A new study conducted by online advertising network Chitika found that states with more college graduates tend to also have higher iPhone sales.
Alaska (66%), Montana and Vermont have the largest percentage of iPhone users. New Mexico (41%), Iowa and Delaware have the lowest share of iPhone sales per capita.
Notably, Chitika found that increased wealth is also linked to greater iPhone sales -- but since college degrees also correlate with higher incomes, Chitika says those results are redundant.
Other studies have found similar results. Rich, white males tend to buy more iPhones, particularly in the first weeks that they go on sale.
In the first month of sales, nearly 80% of iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus buyers in the United States were male, and more than 60% made over $75,000 a year, according to Slice, a company that tracks consumer purchases.

Related: Vast majority of iPhone 6 buyers are rich, white men
The study also notes that iPhone sales correlate to population density. The more densely populated the state, the greater the chance that iPhone sales will be higher in that state.
On a whole, Google's (GOOGL, Tech30) Android sales are significantly higher than Apple's (AAPL, Tech30) sales, but the iPhone remains the single most popular smartphone in the United States. More than 42% of U.S. smartphones are iPhones, according to comScore. Runner-up Samsung commands 28% of the U.S. market.
Yet it's important to take Chitika's results with a grain of salt. Even Chitika admits that its results ""are not comprehensive."" Because the company focused on states and not smaller regions, such as cities or neighborhoods, the results lack ""a great deal of granularity.""

A new study conducted by online advertising network Chitika found that states with more college graduates tend to also have higher iPhone sales.
Alaska (66%), Montana and Vermont have the largest percentage of iPhone users. New Mexico (41%), Iowa and Delaware have the lowest share of iPhone sales per capita.
Notably, Chitika found that increased wealth is also linked to greater iPhone sales -- but since college degrees also correlate with higher incomes, Chitika says those results are redundant.
Other studies have found similar results. Rich, white males tend to buy more iPhones, particularly in the first weeks that they go on sale.
In the first month of sales, nearly 80% of iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus buyers in the United States were male, and more than 60% made over $75,000 a year, according to Slice, a company that tracks consumer purchases.

The study also notes that iPhone sales correlate to population density. The more densely populated the state, the greater the chance that iPhone sales will be higher in that state.
On a whole, Google's (GOOGL, Tech30) Android sales are significantly higher than Apple's (AAPL, Tech30) sales, but the iPhone remains the single most popular smartphone in the United States. More than 42% of U.S. smartphones are iPhones, according to comScore. Runner-up Samsung commands 28% of the U.S. market.
Yet it's important to take Chitika's results with a grain of salt. Even Chitika admits that its results ""are not comprehensive."" Because the company focused on states and not smaller regions, such as cities or neighborhoods, the results lack ""a great deal of granularity.""
Here's the state-by-state breakdown, according to Chitika.

2015-01-22 10:37:24,"Oil boomtown: 'We could see 20,000 layoffs by June' - Jan. 22, 2015 ",http://money.cnn.com/2015/01/22/news/economy/oil-boomtown-layoffs/index.html,"Oil prices have been sinking for months. And while that's good news for most Americans, what happens to towns like Williston, N.D., that have built an entire economy around the oil industry?
The drop in crude prices, while beneficial for drivers, has already cost thousands of oil jobs. Schlumberger (SLB) was among several companies to take a hit, laying off 9,000 people last week.
""They said things aren't good, that oil prices are low, and they aren't going to be drilling as many wells,"" said John Roberts, who was recently laid off as a crew van driver for Schlumberger. ""They gave me 24 hours to leave my house.""
Roberts, who was given housing by the company, is now staying on his friend's couch. All his belongings are packed in his car. He's not leaving Williston though, and is looking for a new job so he can continue sending money back to his wife and four kids in Liberia.
Roberts is the first of what many fear will be waves of layoffs in the U.S. oil patch as firms respond to the recent and largely unexpected plunge in crude prices.
In North Dakota, the number of rigs drilling new oil wells dropped from 187 this time last year to 161 this week -- the lowest level in five years.
""My prediction is we're down to 50 rigs by June,"" said Jim Arthaud, CEO of MBI Energy Services, based in nearby Belfield, N.D.
Arthaud, a North Dakota native who's been active in the state's oil industry since the late 1970s, said he isn't particularly concerned for his company, which employees some 2,000 people repairing oil field equipment, increasing the oil flow at wells, and trucking oil out of the fields to nearby rail hubs.
He's been through this several times before, and instead of laying people off, he plans on using the downturn to hire employees away from other firms that aren't as prepared to deal with it.
In pictures: An oil boomtown on the brink?
But the effects of less drilling are likely to hit the entire area hard. As drilling companies cut back, there will eventually be less work for companies that provide ancillary services like fracking or trucking.
""I'd say we'll lose 20,000 jobs by June,"" said Arthaud.
That's a big number for an area with a relatively small population. It could also be scary for a region that's been growing so rapidly over the last few years, and building infrastructure to handle the boom.
In neighboring Watford City, Mayor Brent Sanford used a personal example to illustrate the growth: When his daughter was born in 2000, there were three other babies born in the county that year. Now there are 90 kids in her class.
""Half the students are living in RVs,"" said Sanford, speaking to the acute shortage of housing that still plagues the area. ""It's inhumane.""
To cope, private developers are adding housing units by the thousands, and the city has borrowed money to build a new high school, events center and hospital.
Some residents are concerned about paying for these things if the oil boom goes bust, but most of the people in town aren't too worried.
""I hear about people getting laid off, but there are still so many people everywhere,"" said Josslyn Dodds, owner of a local pharmacy. ""There are so many people who have made this place their home.""
Sanford noted that there are still thousands of job openings that need to be filled.
Back in Williston, sales at the town's big work supply store are actually up over last year.
Mayor Howard Klug said the city is looking at refining, tourism or returning to its agricultural roots if the oil boom dries up. But he doesn't see that happening.
""I'm not worried, because it's going to come back,"" said Klug."
2015-01-26 05:36:47,"How to skip the pre-blizzard frenzy in stores - Jan. 26, 2015 ",http://money.cnn.com/2015/01/26/smallbusiness/blizzard-wunwun/index.html,"With a powerful blizzard hitting New York, stores are packed with consumers clamoring for storm supplies.
But the savviest New Yorkers are skipping the lines altogether. They're making messengers do the dirty work for them.
On-demand delivery startup Wunwun (which stands for ""what you need, when you need it"") had a huge spike in orders on Monday. Wunwun founder Lee Hnetinka said they're on pace to double the sales they usually post on an average Monday.
Wunwun, which operates in New York City, the Hamptons and San Francisco, promises free delivery within the hour from a Wunwun ""Helper.""
Typically Helpers do deliveries on bikes, but Hnetinka said they're operating under ""blizzard protocol."" If the messengers are unable to ride due to inclement weather, they'll use the subways or walk.
""We send an email to customers to tell them that given the weather, delivery may take a little longer than normal,"" said Hnetinka. ""But it'll still be under one hour.""
Requests have ranged from ingredients for s'mores to ""as much water as one can reasonably carry.""
The list of most requested items for New Yorkers include:

The stores most frequented by Wunwun's Helpers today are:

Wunwun plans to close just one hour early on Monday (at 10 pm), but says Helpers are free to go home as needed.
The storm was the perfect opportunity for Wunwun to roll out its new peak pricing model. Using a weather API, temperatures or precipitation will auto-trigger a ""weather fee"" between $2 and $8. This money goes directly to the Helper.
If last year's Polar Vortex is any indication, people are bound to tip more anyway during the frigid weather. At that time, tipping by New Yorkers jumped 5%, according to GrubHub.

2015-01-25 03:13:06,"When Silicon Valley takes LSD - Jan. 25, 2015 ",http://money.cnn.com/2015/01/25/technology/lsd-psychedelics-silicon-valley/index.html,"""So, I don't think there is such a thing as recreational LSD use,"" veteran Silicon Valley engineer Kevin Herbert said wryly. ""I would be at a Grateful Dead show, high on LSD ... and something about my work would just come to me.""
Herbert, who works at Cisco, has been in the tech sphere for decades. For him, geek-dom and psychedelics have intersected since the start of his adult life: The first LSD he took was created in an M.I.T. lab at and consumed at a science fiction convention.
In Silicon Valley, there is a premium on creativity, and tools thought to induce or enhance it are avidly sought. Some view psychedelics as a weapon in the arsenal, a way to approach problems differently.
There's no definitive scientific evidence that LSD or other hallucinogens improve creativity, and the DEA classifies LSD as a highly addictive, Schedule I drug. But the belief that they might work as a creative tool is enough to fuel some technologists' hope for professional epiphanies.
For people like Herbert, 51, Silicon Valley today feels a bit like the '70s all over again. Herbert drops acid three or four times a year and finds that it helps him solve work problems -- it's a way to ""hack"" the limits of his natural thought.
""There was a case where I had been working on a problem for over a month,"" Herbert said. ""And I took LSD and I just realized, 'Wait, the problem is in the hardware. It's not a software issue at all.'""
Many of Herbert's colleagues are younger, and he says rising stars in the industry often share anecdotes from weekend LSD trips. CNNMoney encountered many engineers and developers who were uncomfortable sharing their habits on the record but use psychedelics both to enhance their work and as their recreational drug of choice.
More from Sex, Drugs & Silicon Valley
Tim Ferriss, a Silicon Valley investor and author of ""The 4-Hour Workweek,"" says he knows many successful entrepreneurs who dabble in psychedelics.
""The billionaires I know, almost without exception, use hallucinogens on a regular basis,"" Ferriss said. ""[They're] trying to be very disruptive and look at the problems in the world ... and ask completely new questions.""
An employee of one of the biggest Silicon Valley companies said he recently made a pivotal career decision while under the influence of magic mushrooms -- changing course from a management track and moving into product security.
""I have a habit of boxing up difficult thoughts and emotions I'm having, and I find psychedelics good for unpacking that stuff,"" he said.
The phenomenon was satirized on HBO's Silicon Valley when psychedelic mushrooms guide one of the show's main characters in the hunt for a new name for their startup.
However, by all accounts, psychedelics are not treated as a simple fix-it for work conundrums. The last thing he would do, Herbert says, is take LSD and then code. It's more subtle: ""if you have issues in your life or anything, you're going to think about them [while high], and think about them in a different perspective.""
A recent study at Imperial College London provides a possible explanation as to why that happens. Twenty participants ingested LSD and then had their brain activity monitored in an fMRI machine. The drug broke down certain brain networks, allowing new patterns of communication to form.
""Psychedelics dismantle 'well-worn' networks, and this allows novel communication patterns to occur ... modules that don't usually talk to each other are talking to each other more,"" explained Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris, the researcher who conducted the study.
Psychedelics have a long history in Silicon Valley.
Daniel Kottke, a college friend and early employee of Steve Jobs', used to drop acid with him at Reed College.
""He was very forthcoming about that, about psychedelics being very helpful for getting him in touch with creativity,"" Kottke said of Jobs.
According to Kottke, Jobs was not interested in smoking marijuana during college because it didn't expand consciousness in the same way.
Meanwhile, in the late '90s, a former high level employee of a major software company (who asked not to be named) said he was taking psychedelics with the ""specific intent of working on software problems."" On one highly successful trip, he came up with design ideas, features and architectural improvements to a piece of software today used by millions.
Of course, people still like to trip for fun. Technologists flock to the annual Burning Man gathering in the Nevada desert, and many attendees say it's an experience best enjoyed on psychedelics -- no professional quandaries required.

2015-02-01 07:21:24,"Super Bowl advertisers 'are on trial' - Feb. 1, 2015 ",http://money.cnn.com/2015/02/01/media/super-bowl-ad-review/index.html,"Defying a stereotype of beer-soaked, sex-saturated ads, this year's crop of Super Bowl commercials were by turns triumphant and thoughtful, and at times even downright somber.
There were babies, dads, dogs, celebrities, athletes, and more babies. But there was also a minute-long message about domestic violence and a dead child who ""couldn't grow up.""
The provocative messages were meant to stand out from the dozens of other spots competing for attention. They might have made for a few awkward moments at viewing parties, but there were still plenty of ads that elicited smiles.
Well-received spots included Budweiser's ""Lost Dog"" commercial; BMW's humorous ad with Katie Couric and Bryant Gumbel; and a serious Coca Cola ad rebuking Internet ""haters."" Other hits included a throw-back Snickers ad starring Danny Trejo and Steve Buscemi and an almost universally praised Dodge ad featuring senior citizens.

For the companies, Sunday was a $4.5 million moment. Months of planning and weeks of promotion culminated in 15 to 60 seconds in front of more than 100 million viewers -- and those viewers instantly delivered their verdicts via the Internet.
""Advertisers are on trial via social media,"" said media strategist Shari Anne Brill.
Companies facing negative reviews on Sunday night -- but still lots of chatter about their ads -- included Nationwide Insurance, T-Mobile and GoDaddy.
Nationwide's ad showed a boy speaking about the life he would have lived, had he not been killed in an accident.
""I'll never learn how to ride a bike. Or get cooties!"" the character said.
""That Nationwide ad just knocked me off my chair,"" CNNMoney's Frank Pallotta tweeted.
As criticism mounted on Sunday night, Nationwide felt compelled to issue a statement: ""The sole purpose of this message was to start a conversation, not sell insurance.""
The conversation Nationwide wanted to start was about how ""preventable injuries around the home are the leading cause of childhood deaths in America.""
Instead, the boy became a meme even before halftime.
""The second I see a kid in one of these commercials I immediately assume they're going to die. Thanks, Nationwide!"" comedian Patton Oswalt tweeted.

Paying an average of $4.5 million for 30 seconds of air time, advertisers during the four quarters of the Super Bowl faced extraordinarily high stakes. (And that's just the price paid to NBC -- companies pay huge amounts of money to get the ads produced.)
""There were a lot of tear-jerkers during the game, including Budweiser's puppy ad, Microsoft (boy with prosthetics) and Nationwide (childhood deaths),"" said Sean Muller, the CEO of iSpot.tv, which tracked online reaction to the ads.
""This had a lot of people begging for more funny ads, which seemed to be more absent this year -- though FiatUSA, Doritos, Skittles and Avocados of Mexico (yes, avocados!) were hits among funny ads.""
One ad right before kickoff that drew immediate commentary: a spot by Chevrolet about the wireless Internet capabilities of its Colorado trucks. ""Chevy trucks advertising 4G LTE instead of driving through gratuitous mud. The world has truly gone tech,"" Mashable chief strategy officer Adam Ostrow wrote on Twitter.
There were also two commercials for mobile games, and for the first time, Snapchat showed up in an ad.
The all-important first ad position after kick-off belonged to Toyota, (TM) which had a feel-good spot starring Paralympic athlete Amy Purdy.
Some advertisers tried to capitalize on their multi-million-dollar investment by releasing their ads days ahead of time -- prompting speculation that this reduced game day anticipation.
Muller said ""the volume of pre-releases/teasers"" was definitely different this year.
Some advertisers, he said, used Facebook's relatively new video features to get attention, ""driving up viewing and social activity significantly.""
But ""the volume of views and activity on Facebook appears to be an additive, meaning it's not taking away from activity on other platforms,"" like YouTube, Muller said. ""And secondly, some brands aren't utilizing it yet -- I suspect that will change next year.""
A high number of ads had social messages, including Procter & Gamble's ""Like A Girl"" ad that challenged gender norms, and Coca Cola's ad encouraging happy Internet communications.
""We can't solve negativity on the Internet, but we can use the world's biggest advertising stage to ask people to think twice before posting negative messages and images,"" Jennifer Healan, the company's group director of integrated marketing content, said in a statement. ""We hoped to inspire Americans to help make the Internet a more inclusive, happier place.""
Perhaps the most thought-provoking ad of the game was the one commissioned by the NFL for its ""No More"" initiative, intended to stop domestic violence and sexual assault.
""The spot, which features a woman calling 911 and pretending to order a pizza because her husband is in the room, is based on a real 911 call,"" said the ad blog Spot Bowl, which called it a ""game-changer.""
It said the NFL was giving over ""some of the airtime it normally reserves for light-hearted self promos"" for the PSA.
Brill, a former executive at the ad agency Carat, noted that the NFL says it is contributing $5 million per year for the next five years to the National Domestic Violence hotline.
""It's about time,"" she said."
2015-02-01 11:10:27,"Super Bowl ads: The year of the Dad - Feb. 1, 2015 ",http://money.cnn.com/2015/02/01/media/super-bowl-dads-ads/index.html,"My father passed away in early November. I have two young boys of my own.
So I am not ashamed to admit that several of this year's Super Bowl ads had me reaching for the box of Kleenex.
Call it ""dad""-vertising if you will. Or ""pa""-rketing. It was refreshing to see Nissan (NSANF), Toyota (TM) and Unilever's (UN) Dove Men make commercials that had positive things to say about fathers.
Advertisers have often relied on lazy, easy joke stereotypes -- treating Dads like bad sitcom characters. Think Al Bundy.
Related: Check out a gallery of this year's Super Bowl ads
But this year's ads celebrated fatherhood and acknowledged that many children have fond memories of their dads.
It's about time. My kids come first. And I know I'm not alone.
It's amazing that it took this long for marketers to realize that ads that tug at the heartstrings of emotionally engaged fathers can be as effective (if not more so) than scantily clad women drinking beer or modeling lingerie.
The commercials for Toyota and Nissan were both very sentimental. I teared up a bit during the Toyota one, which featured a proud dad interacting with his daughter as she grew up.
The Nissan ad was touching but a little too long. I also couldn't get over the fact that a car company chose to focus on the dangerous sport of race car driving and use a song by a singer (Harry Chapin) who was killed in a car crash. But I'm nitpicking.
Still, the Dove ad was the best. It really struck a chord. I thought that it was the most poignant, showing several kids calling for their daddy. I lost it during that one.
It was tough for me to watch this year's Super Bowl without my Dad around. Sports were a big part of our bonding experience -- football in particular.
My father took me to my first football game when I was seven. It was a frigid and windy mid-December day in 1980. The New York Jets played the New Orleans Saints at Shea Stadium.
The Saints were 0-14 at the time. Archie Manning -- father of Peyton and Eli -- was their quarterback. The Jets lost. By one point.
I still had a great time with my Dad at the game. But it didn't take long to figure out that I'd be happier as a Giants fan. (Four Super Bowl victories later, I can definitely say, ""Thanks, Pop!"")
Related: Super Bowl advertisers 'are on trial'
But I now feel conflicted watching football with my sons.
Given all that is wrong with the game -- domestic violence and the history of concussions are just the tip of the iceberg -- I do wonder if the NFL will be around by the time I have grandchildren.
Still, that's a topic for another time.
I'm just glad that on football's (and advertising's) biggest night, some marketers decided to stop showing fathers as idiots who can't change stinky diapers or pay attention to their kids because they are too busy working or watching TV.
Instead, they highlighted the important, hands-on role that many involved fathers play in their kids' lives.
Now will these dad-vertisements make me want to go out and buy a brand new Nissan Maxima or Toyota Camry? No.
But I might consider changing my face wash from Neutrogena to Dove."
2015-01-27 10:38:48,"CNN and other media brands come to Snapchat - Jan. 27, 2015 ",http://money.cnn.com/2015/01/27/media/snapchat-discover-media-deals/index.html,"CNN and other major media companies are setting up shop inside Snapchat, the fast-growing messaging app that has big aspirations to showcase news stories and entertainment.
On Tuesday, Snapchat announced a new ""Discover"" section of its app and deals with almost a dozen different publishers that will program channels within it.
Stories within the Discover section will be viewable for 24 hours -- a whole lot longer than the usual blink-and-you-miss it Snapchat message.
CNN's channel will include five news stories a day, selected by CNN editors and producers.
""You'll be surprised by the amount of context we can include in the snaps,"" said Samantha Barry, head of social news for CNN. ""They are visually-led with great images and videos, but when you swipe up, you will get great CNN context with more images, text and background.""
The other publishers working with Snapchat include ESPN, National Geographic, Vice, Cosmo, Comedy Central, the Food Network, MTV, People, Yahoo News, and the Daily Mail. Some will promote news stories while others will publicize TV shows and entertainment content.
They all want more or less the same thing: to establish themselves on a new social network and experiment with something that is said to have more than 100 million monthly users.
""We're always seeking out new audiences and advertisers, and it's more important than ever to tailor content to suit the platform,"" Andrew Morse, senior vice president and general manager of CNN Digital, said in a statement.
The publishers also want to explore a new form of advertising. CNN, for instance, has sold an exclusive sponsorship for its Snapchat channel to BMW North America, according to a spokeswoman for CNN's parent company Turner Broadcasting.
Snapchat shares in the ad revenue that publishers earn from the snaps.
Snapchat has been working on the Discover feature for many months, and it's been something of an open secret in the industry. It's a crucial launch for the company as it strives to prove, like Facebook and Twitter before it, that it can make money through its communications platform.
Now the startup will have to persuade its users to try out its media partner's channels.
In an introductory blog post, Snapchat differentiated itself from competitors by saying ""this is not social media.""
""Social media companies tell us what to read based on what's most recent or most popular. We see it differently. We count on editors and artists, not clicks and shares, to determine what's important,"" it said.
The media partners were quick to praise the idea: Daily Mail North America CEO Jon Steinberg said ""I think the notion of channels and 'snaps' as news makes Discover something truly different than what anyone's seen on a social platform to date.""
Barry said that for CNN, ""there's a huge opportunity for us to reach new, younger audiences on Snapchat.""
""Let's assume that TV audiences are in their 50s, desktop audience are in the 40s, and mobile is maybe 10 years younger than that,"" she said. ""Being on Snapchat helps us reach every decade -- we are going to reach those people in their 20s andÂ younger on this platform.""
Barry dismissed the notion that young people are uninterested in hard news, calling it ""a myth that has been recycled every generation.""
""We just need to understand how different generations and demographics find, engage and share news,"" she said.
She said the expectation is that some consumers will discover what CNN is covering through Snapchat, then seek more information through CNN's television channels and web sites."
2015-01-30 07:09:35,"Who actually benefits from Obama's 'Middle Class Economics' - Jan. 30, 2015 ",http://money.cnn.com/2015/01/30/news/economy/obama-middle-class-economics/index.html,"President Obama says he's all about the middle class.
He's labeled his agenda, Middle Class Economics, and released a raft of plans that he says will help these families get ahead. To pay for it, he'd tax the rich.
But not everyone in the middle class would benefit from Middle Class Economics. It's heavily weighted in favor of married couples and parents of young children.
""Many people in the middle class will get no benefit from the president's proposal,"" said Roberton Williams, a fellow at the Tax Policy Center. ""Among the middle class, it's targeted at people with kids and second earners. Virtually no single middle class people without kids will get anything.""
The White House and some liberal policy groups, however, contend that the center's methodology wrongly labels some affluent Americans as middle class.
Related: What you need to know about Obama's proposal for the middle class
It's tough to gauge how the tax plan would actually help the middle class because the averages can be deceiving. Many people on both sides of the aisle pounced on the center's recent analysis that showed middle income people, making between $49,000 and $84,000, would pay an extra $7 in tax, on average.
Drilling down, however, reveals that the center added an average $19 tax bill to everyone in that bracket to account for a tax on banks, which ultimately is borne by all Americans.
A different picture emerges when one looks at just the individual income tax provisions. These include a credit for working couples and expanding the child care tax credit.
That's why taxpayers with children come out the big winners under the president's plan. Nearly 51% of middle class filers with kids would receive a tax cut. These taxpayers would receive a $329 decrease, on average.
Some 45% of married folks who file jointly would get a tax break. This group would see an average cut of $200.
Related: How Obama would close the 'trust fund loophole'
Far fewer middle class single and elderly taxpayers would benefit from Obama's plan.
Only 12.5% of single filers would get a tax cut. Overall, this group would see a $61 increase, because nearly 7% of middle class singles would see their taxes go up and that skews the overall average.
Among the elderly, only 10% would enjoy a dip in their taxes. But because many in this group would be hit with another of the president's provisions -- that would require estates to pay capital gains on appreciated assets -- they would pay an additional $152, on average.
Overall, fewer than one in four middle class taxpayers would benefit from Middle Class Economics, according to the center's analysis.
Still, White House Office of Management and Budget Director Shaun Donovan and some left-leaning groups say the Tax Policy Center overestimates the tax hikes on the middle class.
The center doesn't factor in unrealized capital gains into its income ranking, argues the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. So people with moderate incomes but considerable assets are considered middle class. A very small number of these taxpayers would be hit hard by the proposed capital gains tax on estates, which skews the overall average.
Donovan, speaking on NPR Monday morning, pointed to the Department of Treasury analysis, which shows that between a quarter and one-third of families in the $50,000 to $75,000 income range would see a tax change. Their taxes would be lowered by between $450 and $570, on average.
Treasury's analysis, which counts the unrealized gains as income, shows that 99% of Americans paying the capital gain tax have incomes above $500,000.
Also, the Tax Policy Center's analysis doesn't take into account the proposal to make the American Opportunity Tax Credit permanent because it wouldn't happen until after 2017, says CBPP. This would also help middle class families.
As for the rich, the president's plan does accomplish its goal of raising their taxes. Just over three-quarters of the Top 1% would see a tax hike, of $34,500, on average. And more than nine out of 10 of Top .01% would see a tax increase, of $167,250, on average."
2015-01-27 11:41:50,"Apple just posted the best quarter in corporate history - Jan. 27, 2015 ",http://money.cnn.com/2015/01/27/technology/apple-iphone-earnings/index.html,"Apple posted the biggest profit in corporate history last quarter after selling a record number of iPhones.
Apple (AAPL, Tech30) sold 74.5 million iPhones in the last three months. That helped Apple's profit soar more than 37% to $18 billion. That's larger than Gazprom's $16.2 billion profit during the first quarter of 2011 -- the previous profit record posted by a corporation.
Apple also posted a stunning $74.6 billion in sales, up nearly 30% from the same period last year. That's not close to a global corporate record, but it's the best quarterly revenue Apple ever posted.
""Interest in Apple products is at an all time high ... shattering our high expectations,"" said CEO Tim Cook on a conference call with analysts. ""This volume is hard to comprehend.""
Shares of Apple soared 9% in premarket trading.
Mac sales grew about 15% to a record 5.5 million. Apple said iTunes sales also hit a record high, while iPad sales continued to slump, falling 18% to 21.4 million
But the story was the iPhone.
Cook noted that Apple sold an average of 34,000 iPhones every hour.
The iPhone is already the single best-selling gadget of all time. But this past quarter, the iPhone outsold some gadgets made by entire industries.
The whole TV industry sold fewer than 60 million televisions last quarter, according to IHS. The tablet industry sold just 54 million tablets, IDC reported.
In fact, the iPhone very nearly outsold the entire PC industry. Computer makers sold fewer than 84 million desktop and laptops last quarter, according to Gartner. That's every HP (HPQ, Tech30), Lenovo, Mac, Dell -- everything.
Related: Can Apple live up to the iHype?
Apple had never sold more than 51 million iPhones in a quarter, which it accomplished a year ago. But that was before the deal with China's biggest mobile provider, China Mobile (CHL), which went into effect in the first quarter of 2014.
That deal benefited Apple in a big way last quarter. Apple's China sales soared 70% last quarter.
Making such gigantic inroads in China was once believed impossible. Apple's brand did not hold the same cache as some Chinese smartphone makers, including Xiaomi, Lenovo and Huawei. And those brands heavily discount their phones, making them far more accessible to the masses than Apple makes the iPhone.
Apple also rolled out the new iPhone 6 to other countries last quarter faster than it had in previous years, helping Apple boost its iPhone sales. The iPhone 6 is available in 130 countries. Apple also said its supplier efficiencies helped the company manufacture 7 million more iPhones than it had expected to make last quarter.
Related: Microsoft sales soar ... no thanks to Windows
But the iPhone's expected success isn't solely due to China, the global market or supply chains.
The iPhone 6 has proven extremely popular with customers who were holding out for a bigger Apple smartphone. The 4.7-inch screen competes much better with some larger Android smartphones, and the superior camera has helped some would-be defectors stick with the iPhone brand.
The new iPhone didn't just grow Apple's smartphone volume -- it also grew revenue by convincing customers to spend more money on their devices. The even giant-er, $100-more-expensive iPhone 6 Plus has also helped drive sales, accounting for about a quarter of all iPhones sold last quarter, Nomura Securites analyst Stuart Jeffrey believes (Apple doesn't break out iPhone 6 Plus sales separately).
Even better for Apple, Jeffrey expects that about half of all customers spent an extra $100 on their iPhone 6 and 6 Plus devices to upgrade to 64 gigabytes of storage -- four times the amount of the standard 16 GB model. Last fall, Apple doubled the storage size of its mid-tier iPhone. Previous editions had just 32 GB of storage, so customers jumped at a good value.
All the good iPhone news is why Apple posted a record quarter: About two-thirds of Apple's sales and earnings come from the iPhone.
But Apple has more potential billion-dollar products on the way. Tim Cook announced Tuesday that the Apple Watch will go on sale in April.

2015-01-28 03:33:51,"Diamonds are getting cheaper. Time to buy? - Jan. 28, 2015 ",http://money.cnn.com/2015/01/28/investing/diamond-prices-falling/index.html,"The price of just-mined diamonds is falling. But the outlook for the prices consumers pay is less clear.
This week, two British companies that mine for diamonds said prices for rough stones had fallen and will keep sliding.
One of them, Petra Diamonds, noted that prices of rough diamonds dropped by around 9% in the last half of 2014. The company cut its full-year price forecast for its South African diamonds from $152 per carat to $130.
Here's what's going on: Miners like Petra sell rough stones to companies that cut and polish them. But cutters and polishers are starved for cash. And their struggle to access the money they need to pay for diamonds is driving prices down.
A big part the funding shortage is due to the closure of the Antwerp Diamond Bank in late 2014. Belgium is one of the world's biggest diamond trading hubs and the bank was a major lender to the industry.
Falling rough diamond prices won't automatically translate to cheaper engagement rings.
Ben Davis, mining analyst at Liberum in London, likened it to the recent drop in crude oil prices: It takes time to bring relief to drivers at the gas pump.
However, retail prices could drop if stores have to start discounting because of an unrelated trend: increasing demand for colored stones over diamonds.
""As [retailers] try and become more competitive you might see some reductions,"" said Davis, adding that diamond demand is always at the mercy of fashion.
""It doesn't help when Kate Middleton gets a big sapphire,"" he said.
Jewelers across the U.S. are reporting an increase in couples looking for alternatives to diamonds for engagement rings, including gemstones and bands. People have also been more drawn to other precious stones to avoid conflict diamonds.
And the slowing global economy is another headache for high-end jewelers as consumers trim spending. Tiffany was an early victim of bleak economic conditions, registering disappointing holiday sales.

The new release date was announced by one of the satirical magazine's staff members, Laurent Leger.
""Finally,"" he wrote on Twitter. ""A bit more patience, but Charlie Hebdo will come out on February 25 at all good kiosks.""
Caroline Fourest, a former staffer who remains friends with many former colleagues at Charlie Hebdo, told CNNMoney that the magazine is resuming publication ""thanks to their supporters,"" including magazines and publications around the world.
Management of the magazine has revealed little about its plans.
Following the attack on January 7, which killed 12 people, the surviving staff members prepared a special January 14 issue with the help of French newspaper Liberation and other French media outlets.
The ""survivors issue"" sold out across France, and millions of copies were eventually printed to satisfy public demand.

There was talk about a return to normal weekly publication on January 28, but that release date was delayed, giving the survivors more time to grieve and rest.
The magazine's top editor, Gerard Biard, said on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" last month that some of the survivors were still hospitalized.
""And then there are also those who were present during the attack but who escaped injury. They are trying individually to understand why they escaped unharmed,"" he said."

But at the IRS, bringing problem employees back on board isn't entirely out of the question.
Of the more than 7,000 former employees the IRS hired between January 2010 and September 2013, 824 of them were found to have prior performance and conduct issues, a new oversight report by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration found.
TIGTA reviewed a random sample of more than 300 employees who had conduct or performance issues in the past and found that 20% had developed new issues during their second go-round.
Problem behaviors have included employees who willfully failed to file their taxes, gained unauthorized access to taxpayer information, abused the agency's leave policy, misused IRS property, falsified official forms, did a bad job or had behavioral or legal problems off-duty, such as alcoholism or bankruptcy.
Related: IRS says it's using technology from JFK's time
""Based on the types of prior performance and conduct issues we identified, rehiring certain employees presents increased risk to the IRS and taxpayers,"" said J. Russell George, Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration.
TIGTA found that the IRS followed the federal government's ""suitability standards"" for considering a job applicants' past offenses and concluded that nothing ""would prohibit the IRS from hiring these individuals.""
But the oversight report suggested this wasn't enough.
It cited one instance in which the file for a former problem employee was explicitly marked ""Do Not Rehire"" because the person was ""absent without leave for 312 hours."" Yet the person was rehired anyway.
In response to TIGTA's findings, the IRS noted in the report that it revamped its hiring process in 2012 and now ""appropriately considers prior conduct and performance in hiring decisions.""
Related: 'Devastating erosion' of taxpayer services at IRS
TIGTA, however, would like the agency to ""reassess its current processes to more fully consider prior conduct and performance issues before rehiring employees.""
Earlier this week, IRS Commissioner John Koskinen told the Senate Finance Committee that over 99% of the agency's employees are compliant with their taxes - the highest compliance rate of any U.S. government agency, he noted."
2015-02-25 08:15:03,"I turned a 'fake' $1 million into $120 million -- what I'd buy now - Feb. 25, 2015 ",http://money.cnn.com/2015/02/25/investing/investing-charles-garcia-1-million-120/index.html,"In 2014, I turned $1 million into $120 million.
Too bad it wasn't real money.
I had entered into a year-long competition organized by the personal investing division of the Young Presidents' Organization, a global network of chief executives with over 22,000 members in more than 125 countries.
The competitors used Investopedia's game simulator, and any player could observe trades in real time and we were ranked daily. I won. My investment returns were so fantastic that even my wife asked me why our own portfolio didn't look that good.
The fact is that I would never do what I did with real money. Because it was fantasy money I took on a fantastically outsized amount of risk.
How did I make the 12000% rate of return?
My first big win came from JC Penney (JCP) stock and options I bought going into the February and May quarterly earnings. The consensus at that time was that the company was going bankrupt. But the stock more than doubled by midyear. My options bet was even more lucrative, multiplying by 15 times, which boosted my balance to $10 million by midyear.
My other big investments were Gilead Sciences (GILD) -- snagging over 600,000 shares for $67 and selling at $114, which made $30 million. I bought 600,000 shares of Alibaba (BABA, Tech30) at $88 and sold at $108, making $10 million. I also bought and sold Apple (AAPL, Tech30) -- at one time I bought about 100,000 shares for $85 and sold for $105 a share, which made me $2 million.
But these represent just a handful of my investments. I was a very active trader. During the year, I completed 2,870 stock and option trades, averaging about 11 per day.

I'm not going to claim I'm a genius. But I can certainly attribute my successful strategy to lessons I learnt from stock picking champion Marty Schwartz. I learnt at the feet of Schwartz, who received national attention when he won the Stanford University U.S. Investing Championship in 1984. He is the author of ""Pit Bull: Lessons from Wall Street's Champion Day Trader."" I also co-managed money with him at a hedge fund.
Marty worked harder than anyone I ever met. ""You can't make the money unless you do the work!"" he'd always drill into me. His golden rule was ""Before taking a position, always know the amount you are willing to lose. So, even in my competition, I always protected my downside by trading with stop losses which automatically forced me to exit positions that were losing over 15%.
My best source of ideas is Tiger 21, a peer-to-peer learning group for ultra-high net worth individuals. Founded in New York in 1999, it is now in 17 cities. Its 300-plus members control over $30 billion in personal assets. I chair the South Florida Chapter which has 35 members, whose average net worth is $100 million. The members come from virtually every segment of the economy and meet monthly to focus on how to make better investment decisions, chose worthy charities and raise socially responsible children.

From my conversation with peers, 2015 is turning out to be a volatile year. The stock market is overvalued, the Fed is threatening to raise interest rates and the global economy remains weak. All this points to a possible 10% or more market correction which we haven't seen in more than 3 Â½ years.
As I said, I won't advise people to go crazy with their investing techniques like I could using fantasy money. But if I'm right and the market does have a large correction this year, I would buy these three stocks which I would hold for the long term.
1. Gilead Sciences: Gilead is the cheapest $100 billion plus company in the biotech or big pharma space. Gilead's stock trades for under 11x 2015 earnings per share, which I forecast to be $10. It's far cheaper than fellow growth companies like Bristol-Myers, which trades at nearly 34 times next year's earnings, despite the fact that Gilead is expected to grow several times faster than Bristol-Myers. It's also cheaper than large companies like Pfizer. It's generating a ton of cash that it's using to buy back stock and to pay shareholders a dividend.
2. Southwest Airlines (LUV): The International Air Transport Association has forecasted a 26% increase in profits for airliners in 2015 mainly due lower fuel prices, strong economic growth, and improving cargo trends. Southwest Airlines is particularly poised to reward shareholders with strong returns in the upcoming year. This airline's management has produced 42 consecutive years of profitability, earning its place last year as the top performing company in the S&P 500 index. In 2014, Southwest began international service to five countries which it will continue to expand this year, and it also generated strong free cash flow of $1.1 billion, which allowed the company to buy back stock and payout a dividend.
3. CarMax (KMX): The collapse in oil prices is putting cash in people's wallets. Just consider that in December 2014, new car, truck, and SUV sales topped 1.5 million, making it the best month for car sales since 2006. A way to play this trend, is to own CarMax, which is the biggest seller of used cars in the U.S. and it has recently posted double-digit growth in car sales, and a 28% increase in earnings, driven by a sixth consecutive quarter of growth in customer traffic, new store openings and a robust share repurchase program.
-- Charles Garcia is CEO of ALPFA, the largest Latino professional membership organization in the U.S. He chairs the South Florida chapter of TIGER 21, the premier peer-to-peer learning group for ultra-high net worth individuals, whose more than 300 members control over $30 billion in personal assets."
2015-02-10 06:59:39,"Jon Stewart leaving Daily Show - Feb. 10, 2015 ",http://money.cnn.com/2015/02/10/media/jon-stewart-leaving-daily-show/index.html,"It is the end of a fake-news era.
Jon Stewart, whose wit defined ""The Daily Show"" for more than 15 years, will sign off the iconic Comedy Central program later this year.
""In my heart I know it is time for someone else to have that opportunity,"" he said on Tuesday night's show as his studio audience gasped.
Members of the audience yelled ""we love you Jon"" as he expressed his appreciation for the show's staff and called hosting it ""the honor of my professional life.""
It isn't clear when Stewart will sign off; his contract expires in September, but he may leave as soon as July, or as late as December, he said.
In a farewell statement, Michelle Ganeless, the president of the channel, called Stewart ""a comic genius, generous with his time and talent,"" and said the host ""will always be a part of the Comedy Central family.""
Related: Did Comedy Central let its three biggest stars slip away?
Speculation about potential successors started immediately. ""The Daily Show"" is Comedy Central's single most important brand, and it's not going anywhere.
Ganeless said the show ""has become a cultural touchstone for millions of fans and an unparalleled platform for political comedy that will endure for years to come.""
But it will not be the same. Stewart replaced Craig Kilborn as the host of the 11 p.m. ET news satire in 1999 and made the show his own. It is strange to imagine anyone else sitting in his chair.
So Tuesday's announcement was met with a mix of shock and even sadness as many on social media braced for a satirical future without Stewart. Twitter said there were more than 130,000 tweets sent about Stewart's departure between 6:30 and 8 p.m. ET, when the news initially spread.
""Shocked & sad to see the man who gave me my big break on @TheDailyShow is ready to hang it up,"" tweeted actor Josh Gad. ""Can't wait to see what's next!""
Related: How Jon Stewart changed politics
Others observed that TV wasn't just losing a late-night comedy host, but also a sharp-eyed media critic, a man who regularly challenged and mocked news outlets like CNN.
""No way to put a figure on his value to [Comedy Central],"" tweeted former New York Times TV reporter Bill Carter. ""He literally put that network on [the] map personally. Truly irreplaceable.""
And he helped the careers of a whole universe of other comedians, as well.
Over the years Stewart influenced the worlds of news and comedy with his wickedly funny monologues and probing interviews, and he sometimes showed that the two worlds aren't as far apart as they might seem.
Stewart was often credited with educating his fan base -- which includes many millennials -- about the news, even if only unintentionally.
A 2006 study proposed something called ""The Daily Show Effect,"" where Stewart's humor has a positive effect on political participation.
Under Stewart's leadership, ""The Daily Show"" won 20 Emmys, making it one of the most acclaimed shows on TV.
When Stewart signed his most recent contract in 2012, it came as a surprise to some observers, given his long tenure at the program and his publicly expressed interest in trying other things. He recently directed his first feature film.
In a series of interviews to promote his film, ""Rosewater,"" in November, Stewart acknowledged that he had been contemplating his future.
When a New York magazine reporter asked whether the 2016 presidential election might motivate Stewart to stay at ""The Daily Show,"" Stewart said yes.
But he added, ""Part of the thing to remember is this is not the only process by which you can work material, and sometimes it's more important to step back and reconfigure a conversation than continue the same conversation because you know how to do it.""
On Tuesday night's show, Stewart said he doesn't ""have any specific plans"" -- perhaps pre-empting inevitable questions about his future.
He acknowledged that he's been eyeing other work, saying, ""This show doesn't deserve an even slightly restless host and neither do you.""
Stewart also thanked his bosses at Comedy Central, which is owned by Viacom, and remarked that ""17 years is the longest I have ever, in my life, held a job, by ... 16 years and five months.""
Stewart's announcement came two months after his longtime late-night companion on the channel, Stephen Colbert, ended the ""Colbert Report."" Colbert will take over CBS's ""The Late Show"" this fall.
Colbert's successor Larry Wilmore started a new program, ""The Nightly Show,"" that now follows ""The Daily Show.""

2015-02-26 10:51:53,"FCC adopts historic Internet rules - Feb. 26, 2015 ",http://money.cnn.com/2015/02/26/technology/fcc-rules-net-neutrality/index.html,"The FCC has passed a historic measure to more strictly regulate the Internet.
The new rules, based on the principles of ""net neutrality,"" act to provide equal opportunity for Internet speeds and access to websites.
The central question was whether network owners -- like Comcast (CMCSA) or Time Warner Cable (TWC) -- can discriminate what runs on their cables. The FCC's answer on Thursday was: No.
The Democratic-led commission approved 3-to-2, split along party lines, to assert extra government authority over the Internet.
Now for the wild claims on both sides: ""We saved the Internet!"" or ""We've destroyed it with government bureaucracy!""
Don't believe the hype. Take a deep breath. It's a long, tricky road ahead.
The FCC rules won't be official until maybe summertime. Then major telecom companies will challenge new rules in court. A judge might put the rules on hold. The next president, if Republican, could let this fizzle away.
That's why, in the near term, nothing changes. No, Netflix won't suddenly stream any faster. No, AT&T and Comcast won't abruptly stop laying down high-speed fiber cables in your neighborhood as retaliation. And yes, Netflix can still cut deals with broadband companies for faster access to a network.
So what just happened, exactly? The FCC just granted itself the power to defeat a raging, fire-breathing monster: the monopolistic network owners who can kill Internet freedom by blocking websites -- or by creating an Internet fast lane for the privileged, few, rich tech companies that can pay for it.
But this monster is actually a phantom menace. Sure, in the past, telecoms have been bullies. Verizon blocked Google Wallet. AT&T blocked video chatting apps. Comcast slowed down file-sharing services like BitTorrent. Rural telephone provider Madison River blocked Vonage's over-the-Internet phone calls. However, the FCC used existing rules to fix those problems.
The new rules essentially maintain the status quo. The Internet sure feels free today. It'll feel the same way tomorrow.
That's why some worry about how the FCC just ensured net neutrality. To enforce fairness rules, the agency will regulate network owners by scooping them up under Title II of the 1934 Telecommunications Act, a specific set of regulations that apply to phone companies. Telecoms say the rules don't match the services they provide. They don't trust the FCC's promise that it will apply only a tiny fraction of those rules and won't regulate rates and increase taxes.
""Assurances like these don't tend to last very long,"" warned Republican FCC Commissioner Ajit Pai. ""Expect ... regulation to ratchet up as time goes on.""
Meanwhile, Tom Wheeler, the FCC chairman who ditched his original dialed-back plan for this one, assured this isn't a government power grab.
""This is no more a plan to regulate the Internet than the First Amendment is a plan to regulate free speech,"" he said. ""They both stand for the same concept: openness, expression and an absence of gatekeepers.""
How did we start caring about this? Credit comedian John Oliver, who got enough viewers of his HBO show that a record 4 million Americans sent comments to the FCC.
He framed it from the point of view of the average person dealing with their Internet service provider. Plans are expensive, service is inexplicably spotty and you have little choice. Clearly, the network owners are the bad guys.
During Thursday's hearing, the testimony of those who spoke in favor of the FCC's new rules all took that populist tone. Etsy CEO Chad Dickerson thanked the FCC for ""protecting the Internet as an engine for economic opportunity."" Celebrated technologist Sir Tim Berners-Lee said this ensures modern entrepreneurs the same opportunity he had when he created the World Wide Web 26 years ago.
After the vote, President Obama issued this statement via Twitter: ""Today's FCC decision will protect innovation and create a level playing field for the next generation of entrepreneurs.""
But wait, there's a third option. As this fight makes its way through the courts, Congress has the opportunity to stand up and write rules that work too.
After all, both network owners and the websites that flow data through them have a point. Outright blocking and anti-competitive behavior is unfair and should be illegal. On the other hand, for technical reasons, network owners need to manage traffic. Your video stream needs to move faster than your email for your experience to feel smooth.
That's why critics call the Title II approach -- what the FCC did today -- a blunt instrument. But it's not clear that it's as wonderful -- or terrible -- as everyone says.
Rob Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a technology policy think tank, laments how the conversation has spiraled out of control.
""This has become a debate about a false choice: letting carriers do whatever the heck they want and overly burdensome regulations,"" Atkinson said.

Rolls-Royce, the pinnacle of British luxury motoring, announced on Tuesday that it, too, would add an SUV to its line-up.
The automaker hand-delivered a statement to CNNMoney on embossed Rolls-Royce letterhead. It says it will build ""A car that offers the luxury of a Rolls-Royce in a vehicle that can cross any terrain.""
It will be a ""A high-bodied car with an all-new aluminum architecture.""
Related: Other ultra-luxury SUVs on the way
By now we've gotten used to luxury car brands like Porsche, Mercedes and Lexus selling a full range of SUVs but the inexorable trend has moved ever upward on the price scale. Bentley (VLKAF) and Maserati (FCAU) have announced their intentions to produce SUVs. Even the Italian exotic brand Lamborghini is working one one. Jaguar has announced that it will produce its own SUV despite the fact that its sister brand, Land Rover, produces nothing but SUVs.
So far, at least, Lamborghini competitor Ferrari has not announced any plans to produce an SUV and still says that it never will.
Properly speaking, Rolls-Royce, itself, is not calling the vehicle it intends to produce an SUV. Instead, Rolls-Royce has said it will offer its customers a ""go anywhere vehicle."" While Rolls-Royce executives have said they cannot object to the term SUV being used to describe the vehicle, which they refer to as a car and not a truck, they do not call it that themselves. It is expected to have a traditional wagon-like SUV shape.
Rolls-Royce actually does have some have some history in off-road driving.
""Rolls-Royces conveyed pioneers and adventurers like Lawrence of Arabia across the vastness of unexplored deserts and over mountain ranges,"" Rolls-Royce said in its statement signed by Chairman Peter Schwarzenbauer and CEO Torsten Mueller-Ortvoes.
Among other uses, Rolls-Royces with guns mounted on them were used for hunting large game in India during the colonial era.
Today, Rolls-Royce is owned and operated by the German luxury automaker BMW. BMW also owns Mini, which, by the way, makes two SUV models. The new Rolls-Royce vehicle will not share its engineering with BMW SUVs, Williams said. It will be engineered and designed as a unique Rolls-Royce product.
Rolls-Royce has not announced any timetable for production of the new vehicle. Pricing has not been decided upon, either.
""This new journey begins now,"" the automaker said in its letter. ""We will take our time developing and perfecting this new concept of luxury. We will include our customers, enthusiasts and media along the way and will keep you informed of our progress."""

The population of the city has passed its previous record of 8.6 million, which dates back to 1939.
London went into decline for 50 years following the outbreak of World War II but has bounced back over the past quarter of a century to become what mayor Boris Johnson calls ""the best big city in the world.""
Here are seven amazing statistics about the fastest growing city in the West:
1. Talent influx: As the financial capital of Europe, London attracts thousands of high-skilled migrants every year. It was named the talent capital of the world in 2013 by Deloitte.
2. Booming economy: Robust growth in the technology and creative industries, a recovery in financial services, and booming housing market are powering London forward. Its economy was recently crowned the fastest growing in the western world.
3. Big money: London has more billionaires than any other city in the world -- 72. It beats Moscow with 48 billionaires, while New York has 43.
4. Pricey homes: The influx of rich has left its mark on London's property market, which is now worth as much as Brazil's annual economic output.
5. Moving around: More Londoners means more pressure on transport. 24 million journeys are made every day across the capital, many in overcrowded subways.
6. Still growing: The UK capital is expected to continue growing -- its population is forecast to reach 9 million by 2021 and 11 million by 2050.
7. Not big enough: In 1939, London was the biggest city in the world. Despite its growth, it doesn't even make the top 10 world cities today.

2015-01-25 03:07:44,"Are smart drugs driving Silicon Valley? - Jan. 25, 2015 ",http://money.cnn.com/2015/01/25/technology/nootropics-smart-drugs/index.html,"Open the refrigerator in entrepreneur Dave Asprey's home and you may as well be at a pharmacy.
Every morning he downs a cocktail of about 15 pills, along with his trademark Bulletproof Coffee, which is designed to increase focus. He also squirts a dark-colored goop down his throat called Unfair Advantage, a product he says helps his body metabolize food more efficiently.
He spews names you probably have never heard before: Piracetam, Aniracetam, CILTEP, Methyl, Cobalamin.
Asprey's morning dose is a mix of what's referred to as smart drugs, a broad term for compounds that may increase cognitive function. He also describes many of them as nootropics, which generally refer to natural supplements or nutrients. The terms are often used interchangeably.
The wide umbrella includes everything from fish oil to prescription-only medications like Modafinil, a narcolepsy drug that healthy people sometimes use for the off-label purpose of working all night long.
While many smart drugs are natural and legal, others require prescriptions and are acquired illegally for non-medical usage.
Each one has a different benefit, Asprey, 41, says. One may help bolster memory, another will help you focus. One of his pills helps improve vision, and another promises more energy. They all have the same goal -- to help you maximize your potential.
The idea: mix and match enough of them to find the killer combo; the winning blend is what's known as a ""stack."" Asprey's stack is ever evolving as he experiments with different ingredients.
After selling his first company for millions, Asprey realized that he was unhealthy and decided to focus on losing weight and maximizing his brainpower.
""When I weighed 300 pounds, I was having really bad problems with brain fog,"" he said. ""As an entrepreneur, that's a problem. I fixed that.""
Asprey says he spent 15 years and over $300,000 to ""hack his own biology."" Along with supplements, he also uses techniques to exercise his brain -- he claims to have increased his IQ by 20 points. His health podcast has been downloaded more than 6 million times.
He now markets and sells some of the supplements he takes. Many of his customers are in Silicon Valley, where the competition is fierce and there's pressure to perform.
More from Sex, Drugs & Silicon Valley
With limited research on long-term effects of smart drugs, much of the experimentation is controversial. But that doesn't stop people, according to Tim Ferriss, a Valley entrepreneur and investor.
""Just like an Olympic athlete who's willing to do almost anything, even if it shortens your life by five years, to get a gold medal, you're going to think about what pills and potions you can take,"" Ferriss said. ""In many people's minds, the difference between completely failing ... and making a billion dollars, is right here,"" he explained, pointing to his head.
Ferriss is a leader in the quantified-self movement, a group focused on tracking and manipulating what's going on inside their bodies. He says he's tried every class of drugs you can imagine, describing himself as a human guinea pig.
While nootropics are gaining steam, entrepreneurs are capitalizing.
Related: I did LSD with Steve Jobs
Y Combinator, a prominent Silicon Valley accelerator, received a number of applications from entrepreneurs looking to create their own nootropics companies.
""There's clearly consumer demand,"" Y Combinator president Sam Altman told CNNMoney. ""We haven't funded one, we're still getting to understand the space.""

Appearing alongside NBC talk show host Seth Meyers on Wednesday at the 92nd Street Y in Manhattan, Williams said the past two weeks of professional turmoil have been ""tough, obviously toughest on my dad,"" but she assured the audience, ""I know you can trust him.""
""One thing this experience has not done is shake my trust and belief in him as a man,"" Allison said about her father.
""He's a really good man,"" she said. ""He's an honest man. He's a truthful man. He has so much integrity. He cares so much about journalism. And yes, he's a really good dad, but I know you can trust him because, as any good daughter does, I have tested him on that.""
The nearly full crowd laughed at that point.
Williams, one of the stars of HBO's ""Girls,"" spoke about the controversy at the very start of the long-scheduled event. Meyers set her up by saying he assumed that it's been a ""difficult time"" for the Williams family.
""Yeah, this has been a really hard time,"" she said. ""We have also been very, very lucky, counting our blessings. We have our health, we have each other.""

Williams' mother was in the audience for Wednesday's event.
""My dad has always been there for us 100% of the time, even sometimes before we knew we needed him,"" Williams added. ""And so this, to be here for him, is the least we can do.""
Allison Williams' remarks are probably as close as we'll come to hearing from Brian Williams for a while.
NBC News has barred the anchor from speaking to the press without permission, and he hasn't addressed the matter since he apologized on February 4 for telling an exaggerated story about a helicopter mission in Iraq.
The controversy has only metastasized since then, with mounting questions about other possible exaggerations. NBC's internal investigation into those disputed accounts appears to be far from complete.
Following her general comments about trust, Williams specifically invoked Iraq. She was in ninth grade when the war started and her father traveled to the Middle East for NBC.
""There was a father-daughter dance at the end of that year,"" she said. ""Before he left, he was assuming he'd be back in time for the dance. And then, as the date was coming, it didn't seem like he was going to make it.""
""But he had promised,"" she recalled, ""and so a couple days before I was so upset. And I got a surprise call from Iraq from my dad and he was asking if I had a date to the dance.""
""So that's the kind of man he is,"" she said, ""and I can't wait until he's back on TV. And I know that many of you guys feel that way.""
On that note, the audience applauded.
After the initial remarks about her father's character, most of the discussion dealt with Williams' time at Yale, her role on ""Girls,"" and NBC's live production of ""Peter Pan.""
Williams appeared earlier in the evening at a Michael Kors store in Manhattan to mark the launch of an eyewear line. A publicist for that event reportedly asked journalists in attendance to steer clear of questions about Williams' ""personal life.""
Those questions never used to be off-limits. When she appeared on ""The Daily Show"" last month, Williams joined Jon Stewart in taking some playful shots at her father.
And last year, she appeared on NBC's ""Late Night"" shortly after Meyers took over as host. Her appearance came one night after Brian Williams sat down with Meyers.
""This is -- you know, again, we're only seven shows in -- first father-daughter, back-to-back,"" Meyers joked at the time.
Allison Williams' appearance on Wednesday came exactly two weeks after her father's on-air apology, which was widely deemed insufficient.
In the wake of his six-month suspension, some NBC News staffers have expressed doubts that he'll ever return to the anchor chair, but public opinion thus far has been mixed.
Magid Associates, one of the leading media consulting firms, found that nearly half of network news viewers think Williams can restore his credibility.
And a CNN/ORC poll released on Wednesday morning showed that 52% believe Williams should be allowed back on ""NBC Nightly News,"" while 40% said he should not.

On Tuesday, investors believed that a union could be close.
Shares of both Staples (SPLS) and Office Depot (ODP) soared after the Wall Street Journal reported that the office supply stores are in ""advanced talks"" to merge.
Office Depot stock rallied 18% and Staples rose 10%.
The companies have been under pressure to explore a merger from activist investor Starboard Value, which owns big stakes in both Staples and Office Depot.
Starboard has argued that an alliance would create a stronger company that can better take on online competitors like Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) and discounters like Wal-Mart. (WMT)
Related: The end is near for RadioShack
In a letter to Staples CEO Ron Sargent last month, Starboard suggested that it could enlist other shareholders to join its cause if the company didn't cooperate. Staples responded that it ""carefully considers"" all steps to boost value for shareholders.
Starboard did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The office-supplies industry is hurting badly. People simply aren't buying office supplies at the pace they used to. Many young people don't have printers anymore, nor do they use as many pens or pencils.
Plus there's a lot of competition from online and discount stores.
Staples announced plans last year to close 225 stores in North America, or about 12% of the total, to trim costs in the face of weaker sales.
Analysts say a merger between would generate savings of at least $1 billion in ""synergies."" The combined company could save tons of cash by closing poor-performing stores and optimizing supply chains.

But it won't be easy -- such a marriage would face extra scrutiny from regulators.
After all, Office Depot recently acquired another rival OfficeMax, meaning all three brick-and-mortar stores would end up under one corporate roof.
Don't forget that in 1996, the FTC shot down a proposed merger between Office Depot and Staples on antitrust grounds. However, the landscape is a little changed since then and the same agency also approved the 2013 merger of Office Depot and OfficeMax.
Both Staples and Office Depot said they don't comment on ""rumors or speculation.""

The company was concerned that criminals were using taxpayer's identity information (like a Social Security number) stolen from somewhere else to file fake returns via TurboTax and collect refunds.
In Minnesota and Utah, for example, some taxpayers had logged into TurboTax and saw that a return had already been filed under their name.
Intuit (INTU), the company that owns TurboTax, said it had a security firm do a preliminary examination and ""now believes these instances of fraud did not result from a security breach of its systems.""
The company began processing tax returns again at 6 pm ET after a temporary shutdown that started Thursday.
Federal returns, which have more stringent fraud controls in place, were unaffected by the outage.
The investigation is ongoing, Intuit said. And in the meantime it has beefed up its security technology to protect customers against ID theft.
About 29 million people used TurboTax to file their tax returns last year.
Related: Tax season unleashes cyberscams
Earlier Friday, Intuit spokeswoman Julie Miller said the company had heard from a ""small handful of states"" that saw an uptick in suspicious filings.
Miller declined to name the states, but Minnesota, Alabama and Utah all reported issues. Nineteen states in total identified similar problems, according to the Utah Tax Commission.
In Utah, 28 fraudulent returns were filed over the course of two days this week, the Tax Commission said. Another 8,000 were flagged as suspicious and are being investigated.
""That is off the chart for us,"" said Charlie Roberts, a spokesman for the state's tax commission.
Utah's fraud detection system indicates that whoever is filing the fraudulent claims probably has access to taxpayers' returns from previous years. The state said its own systems had not been compromised and could not say how a criminal could have gotten access to the previous year's filings.
But it warned that Utah taxpayers who filed state income tax returns electronically prior to 2014 through third-party vendors are potentially affected.
""Unfortunately, the bad guys have a lot of places to get information,"" Miller said.
All it takes to file a fraudulent return under someone else's identity is a name and Social Security number. The online black market is full of this type of information.
CNNMoney discovered last year that hackers stole more than 6.5 million Social Security numbers in 2014.
But possibly 80 million more were stolen so far this year from insurance giant Anthem (ANTM), which was was hit by a massive data breach. Hackers stole a database of names, birthdays, medical IDs, Social Security numbers, street addresses, e-mail addresses and employment information.
When someone claims your tax return fraudulently, it can take years for the IRS to complete its investigation and clear your name.
H&R Block, another tax preparer, said Friday that it was not having similar problems with state returns.
Intuit customers who believe they are victims of tax fraud can call 800-944-8596 for help. TurboTax said it will prepare taxes for affected customers for free, and provide identity protection services and free credit monitoring.

This fairy-tale scenario is set to become a reality for about 60,000 low-income Croatians who have been struggling to pay their bills.
The Croatian government, acting in place of a fairy godmother, has launched a program called ""Fresh Start"" that will cancel the debt owed by some of the poorest people in the country.
The state, alongside a number of banks, telecom operators, electricity companies, local governments and other firms, have collectively agreed to forgive debt worth up to 60,000 Croatian kuna ($8,830) per individual.
Croatia's economy is in the midst of a prolonged recession, with gross domestic product declining every quarter since the end of 2011.
This measure is expected to boost consumer confidence and spending.

The program is designed specifically for households that made less than 2,500 kuna ($370) over the last three months and meet other financial criteria.
""This is for the bottom layer of debtors where there is clearly no chance that they will ever repay the debts that they have,"" said Otilia Dhand, a political analyst at Teneo Intelligence.
The government noted that it has never had a debt forgiveness program of this magnitude, but said this is a one-off initiative.
Dhand says the move was not a surprise since the government has recently lost support in the polls. She said this will give the government a popularity boost ahead of parliamentary elections, which are expected by the end of February 2016.
The International Monetary Fund has recommended a laundry list of reforms and overhauls to get the Croatian economy back on track. In November, it said it supported the idea of writing off debt for distressed households."

Sticking to his guns typically paid off dividends for Jobs and Apple, even when vocal critics mocked the company's decisions.
But since Jobs' death in 2011, Apple (AAPL, Tech30) has been slowly pushing back against some of its founder's most strongly held beliefs and doing things Jobs said he would never consider.
Stylus: This week, an Apple analyst suggested that the company's forthcoming iPad will ship with a stylus.
One of Steve Jobs' most famous rants was about how much he hates styluses. In 2007, while introducing the iPhone at the Macworld convention in San Francisco, he mocked other smartphones of that era that featured styluses.
""Who wants a stylus?"" Jobs said while introducing the iPhone. ""You have to get 'em, put 'em away, you lose 'em. Yuch! Nobody wants a stylus. So let's not use a stylus.""
One of the first things Jobs did when coming back to Apple in 1997 was to kill the Newton, a tablet-like device that used a stylus.
""God gave us 10 styluses. Let's not invent another,"" Jobs said about the project, according to Walter Isaacson's biography.
Yet Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities said the widely expected 12.9-inch ""iPad Pro"" will come with a stylus when Apple announces it in the spring, according to a report obtained by AppleInsider.
Related: Apple's 7 most stubborn decisions
Small tablets: Another epic Jobs rant came in October 2010, when he discussed his disdain for a new wave of smaller tablets coming to market.
On the company's earnings call with analysts, Jobs said the iPad's 10-inch screen was ""the minimum size required to create great tablet apps.""
He said even making images appear sharper on the screen wouldn't help smaller tablets become usable ""unless your tablet also includes sandpaper, so that the user can sand down their fingers to around one quarter of the present size.""
""There are clear limits of how close you can physically place elements on a touch screen before users cannot reliably tap, flick or pinch them,"" he said.
A year after Jobs died, Apple introduced the iPad mini -- by far the best-selling iPad in the company's lineup.
Big phones: During Apple's iPhone 4 ""Antennagate"" kerfuffle in 2010, Steve Jobs derided big phones.
When a reporter asked him whether Apple would consider making a bigger iPhone to improve antenna reliability, Jobs scoffed. He called Samsung's Galaxy S phones ""Hummers.""
""You can't get your hand around it,"" Jobs said. ""No one's going to buy that.""
Apple finally debuted a taller iPhone 5 a year after Jobs died, and a much larger iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus last year.
Related: 10 best Steve Jobs emails
Life-like software design: Steve Jobs wanted the iPhone's software to mimic real life. For instance, he told Apple's designers to model iCal's leather after the seats on his Gulfstream jet.
Apple's Mail app had a linen background, the iBookstore featured wooden shelves, and the Notes app was made to look like a legal pad.
A year after Jobs died, Apple fired Scott Forstall, a software executive who was a champion of Jobs' design preferences. A year later, Apple introduced iOS 7, which did away with any ties to real-life objects.
Philanthropy: Among the first things Jobs did in his 1997 return to Apple (after he banished all styluses) was to end Apple's philanthropic giving programs. He said he wanted to bring Apple back to profitability, but he never reinstated the programs even after Apple posted some of the biggest profits ever recorded by a public company.
Apple was prominently involved with Bono's (RED) charity for AIDS research, but Jobs himself was not a large donor.
When Tim Cook took over as CEO in 2011, one of his first actions was to bring back Apple's donation-matching program."

In Buffalo, New York, the city is selling vacant properties for a buck to those willing to fix them up and live in them for a few years.
Buffalo's Urban Homesteading Program, which has been around for almost four decades now, requires buyers to fix any code violations within 18 months and live in the home for at least three years. In return, the owner can live off just a few hundred dollars in property taxes, insurance and other costs each year.
Yet, as a attractive as it may seem, fewer than 10 buyers close $1 sales each year, according to city officials.
One reason: A $1 home can become a big money pit. Most of the homes have been abandoned for years, suffering leaks, break-ins and general neglect. Eventually, minor problems grow into expensive headaches, and many city-owned properties end up facing the wrecking ball.
About 60 homes were razed in the last year, and 90 more are on the city's demolition list. As a result, only a handful of homes are still up for sale in the areas eligible for the $1 program, according to city's Division of Real Estate.

""They're constantly losing value,"" said David Torke, a blogger and photographer who has helped several buyers get approved by the city. ""If there is a small roof repair, by the time the second thaw cycle rolls around, there's a gaping hole and the floorboards start rotting.""
Mike Puma, who works for a company that preserves old buildings, is currently renovating a historic two-family home he bought for $1 last year. Like many of the houses Buffalo is selling for a dollar, the home had been stripped of its pipes and furnace and needed new interior walls.
""It's pretty much guaranteed to be a full gut job,"" said Puma.
Replacing all the crucial components in a home -- electricity, plumbing, roofing -- carries a hefty price tag. Puma's renovation has cost him $40,000 so far, and he estimates that it will probably total $55,000 before the work is done.
Trash bags alone have added up to hundreds of dollars. Puma spent about $2,000 on trash removal overall, including two dumpsters for hauling away the home's 20,000 pounds of debris.
Related: 'I bought a house for $1,000'
Work on the electrical and heating and cooling systems came to more than $15,000, even with friends contributing labor at a substantial discount, and structural components ruined by leaking water cost $6,000.
Puma has burned through $30,000 in personal savings, a $10,000 loan from a local bank and nearly every penny of his paychecks left over after expenses.
But he still expects to make money on the project within 5 years.
That's because the home qualifies for thousands of dollars in historical tax credits for being in a registered historic neighborhood, and Puma can rent out the second half of the building.
Deyron Tabb, a Buffalo local who bought a $1 home down the street from Puma four years ago, said he was shocked by how quickly his savings were depleted.
Related: 10 least affordable rental markets
""The structure of the house was immaculate, and the roof was just repaired,"" he said.
But the home had been sitting vacant for about five years, and right away the rehab costs started adding up. Tabb replaced dry wall, fixed sagging floors and repaired carpentry.
""I blew through the first $20,000, then I blew through the second $20,000,"" he said. ""It was a huge surprise.""
Tabb, who is now a union electrician, started taking classes so he could make the repairs correctly himself.
Overall, he spent about $78,000. Tabb said he now knows he could have completed the project with far less. Still, his experience left him with a new career and a beautiful home.
""I would do it all over again, and I would enjoy every minute of it,"" he said.
In the same neighborhood, Tom Lester and his girlfriend are just beginning work on a tiny shotgun-style home they bought for $1 in June. So far, the 1,200-square-foot home has cost them less than $5,000.
""We've been incredibly lucky with everything,"" said Tom Lester. ""We have a lot of handy friends, so I spend a lot on pizza and beer and dumpsters.""
Next up: $3,000 to replace stolen pipes, and maybe a new roof within a few years.
But Lester said he knows to expect. ""We asked around,"" he said. ""$30,000 is a good number, when it's all said and done.""

2015-02-02 11:01:02,"Super Bowl XLIX posts the largest audience in TV history - Feb. 2, 2015 ",http://money.cnn.com/2015/02/02/media/super-bowl-ratings/index.html,"Like the New England Patriots, NBC's broadcast of the Super Bowl was a champion on Sunday night.
NBC announced on Monday that the Patriots 28-24 last second victory over the Seattle Seahawks drew an average audience of 114.4 million viewers.
This makes Super Bowl XLIX the most watched broadcast in U.S. TV history.
Sunday's total was up from last year's 112.2 million viewers -- the largest recorded TV audience at the time.
It's important to note, however, that Nielsen doesn't account for groups at sports bars or viewing parties, so Sunday's numbers could even be more massive.
The game peaked at 120.8 million viewers during its final minutes when the Patriots literally snatched away victory from the Seahawks.
This record audience is obviously a big win for the Peacock network and the NFL, but it's also a victory for many of the game's sponsors like McDonald's (MCD) and Budweiser (AHBIF) who shelled out $4.5 million per 30-second ad for the game.
""Super Bowl XLIX delivered for all of our partners, proving once again that the Super Bowl is the most dominant and consistent property on television,"" Mark Lazarus, chairman of NBC Sports, said in a statement.
Katy Perry and her dancing costumed sharks also took a bite out of the history books Sunday night with a record audience for the performer's halftime show.
Perry's colorful pyrotechnic extravaganza hauled in 118.5 million viewers making it the most watched halftime show in the Super Bowl's 49 year history.
NBC also had a big night on the digital side of the things, with its live stream of the game bringing in a ton of viewers.
More than 1.3 million people watched the Super Bowl through NBC's web stream of the game during the final moments when Patriots' Malcolm Bulter intercepted a pass from Seattle on the goal line to seal the win.
Even though the Seahawks came up short, the team's fans still watched in droves.
According to ESPN's Sports Business Reporter Darren Rovell, 89% of the TVs on in Seattle during the game were tuned into the Super Bowl.
Super Bowl XLIX was a huge hit on social media too.
Over 28.4 million tweets related to the game and halftime show were sent during the live telecast.
This made it the most tweeted Super Bowl ever.
The game also gave a boost to networks that didn't even broadcast it, like ESPN and the NFL Network.
ESPN aired 346 hours of NFL programming during Super Bowl Week across its networks, and in a press release on Monday it said people spent a total of 7 billion minutes viewing the coverage.
""That correlates to 13,628 years of television viewing,"" the network said."
2015-02-15 05:38:43,"Coming soon: A change in who gets overtime pay - Feb. 15, 2015 ",http://money.cnn.com/2015/02/15/pf/overtime-pay/index.html,"The Obama administration is expected to move forward soon on its plan to provide overtime pay protections to low-salaried managers who don't qualify for them.
The move could affect millions of workers. It is aimed at addressing what the White House says is an erosion of the rules that established the 40-hour workweek -- a ""linchpin of the middle class.""
The way it works now, companies can avoid paying OT to any full-time workers making as little as $23,660 -- or $455 a week -- by classifying them as ""exempt"" and paying them as salaried employees, rather than hourly.
That means when they don't get overtime pay even if they work more than 40 hours a week.
And it's not just managers in lower-paid jobs in this bucket. Exempt positions also include administrators and sales employees, among others.
The expectation among policy experts is that the Department of Labor will propose raising the $23,660 income threshold, most likely to somewhere between $42,000 and $52,000. The agency may also amend how ""exempt"" duties are determined.
What advocates want: The liberal Economic Policy Institute estimates that 3.5 million more workers would become eligible for overtime pay if the threshold were raised to $42,000. And 6.1 million workers would qualify if the threshold approaches $52,000.
Advocates for an increase, like EPI and the National Employment Law Project, would like to see the threshold raised to at least $51,168 -- or $984 a week.
That threshold would provide automatic overtime eligibility for 47% of workers. That's up from 12% today but still below the 65% eligible in 1975.
What's more, advocates would like the Labor Department to be more specific as to what makes a position exempt from overtime. For example, to be classified as an exempt administrative employee, a worker's primary duty must include the ""the exercise of discretion and independent judgment with respect to matters of significance.""
Related: Minimum wage increases will give raises to 3 million workers
Since every job requires some independent judgment, ""that's meaningless,"" said Judi Conti, NELP's federal advocacy coordinator.
She would rather the department require that at least 51% of a worker's time be spent on exempt duties.
That would help prevent hollow promotions where a low-paid worker is given the title of manager but not given much managerial power, Conti noted.
What concerns employers: More generous overtime protections, of course, will mean higher payroll costs.
Companies either would end up paying time-and-a-half to more eligible workers, or they may decide it's less expensive to hire more people to cover the extra hours once worked by formerly exempt employees.
But just how much more they'll have to pay is a concern.
""One [income] threshold for the whole country won't work,"" said Marc Freedman, executive director of labor law policy at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
The Chamber has recommended that the Labor Department apply geographically specific thresholds.
A big change in the income threshold would require employers to reclassify millions of salaried workers to hourly -- and that could cause workers to lose some employee benefits, said Mike Aitken, vice president for government affairs at the Society for Human Resource Management.
Their morale could suffer too.
For instance, while salaried workers are often given some latitude to schedule their day, hourly workers may get pay docked or have to use vacation time for midday appointments, Aitken said.
Some companies, too, offer merit-based bonuses to salaried workers but not to hourly ones. Or they may be put on a different vesting schedule for vacation days, he added.
Related: Many low-wage workers not protected by minimum wage
What's ahead: The Labor Department has February marked on its agenda for release of the proposed overtime rules. But some policy observers suspect the release could come in March or April.
Whenever they new rules are released, however, it will be the start of a comment-and-review process that could take months before anything is finalized.
Advocates for change hope it won't take too long. If the new rules go into effect right before President Obama leaves office, the next president could undo them if he or she doesn't like them."

A new report from the Brookings Institution ranks America's cities according to the percent of the workforce employed in what it calls ""advanced industries."" This means the industry spends a lot on R&D and has a high number of workers in science, technology, engineering and math-oriented roles.
Some of these cities are intuitive. San Jose, with nearly twice the advanced industry jobs per capita as second-ranked Seattle, is the heart of Silicon Valley. Seattle has Microsoft (MSFT, Tech30) and Boeing (BA).
But third-place Wichita? That city hosts major manufacturing facilities for makers of smaller aircraft, including Bombardier and Cessna.
Palm Bay, Fla., with its proximity to Cape Canaveral, is home to several aerospace companies as well as makers of audio and visual equipment -- an outgrowth of the navigational and communications equipment used in space travel.

Detroit gets high marks for its diversity. In addition to autos, the city has robust advanced battery and software industries, among others.
""The best-positioned cities have specializations in multiple areas,"" said Mark Muro, a senior fellow at Brookings' Metropolitan Policy Program.
Brookings identified 50 advanced industries nationwide. In addition to the ones above, they include pharmaceuticals, oil drilling, architecture and chemicals.
The pay is good -- $90,000 a year on average -- and the growth rates high. These advanced industries have been adding jobs at nearly twice the rate of the overall economy since 2010.

Best of all, not everyone needs to be Einstein. Less than half the workers in this sector have a bachelor's degree.
""You need someone to operate the machines, to run the systems,"" said Muro. ""The opportunities are here, if you have the technical training.""
To help match workers to job openings, the report recommends greater collaboration between private employers and educational institutions to make sure that what people are learning in school are actually the skills that regional employers need.

It also called for greater cooperation between the public and private sector in R&D, as well as investments in things like educational institutions, testing facilities and business incubators in the metro regions where these advanced industries are located.
""It's all a way to knit together actors who have not been communicating as well as they could,"" said Muro.

This fairy-tale scenario is set to become a reality for about 60,000 low-income Croatians who have been struggling to pay their bills.
The Croatian government, acting in place of a fairy godmother, has launched a program called ""Fresh Start"" that will cancel the debt owed by some of the poorest people in the country.
The state, alongside a number of banks, telecom operators, electricity companies, local governments and other firms, have collectively agreed to forgive debt worth up to 60,000 Croatian kuna ($8,830) per individual.
Croatia's economy is in the midst of a prolonged recession, with gross domestic product declining every quarter since the end of 2011.
This measure is expected to boost consumer confidence and spending.

The program is designed specifically for households that made less than 2,500 kuna ($370) over the last three months and meet other financial criteria.
""This is for the bottom layer of debtors where there is clearly no chance that they will ever repay the debts that they have,"" said Otilia Dhand, a political analyst at Teneo Intelligence.
The government noted that it has never had a debt forgiveness program of this magnitude, but said this is a one-off initiative.
Dhand says the move was not a surprise since the government has recently lost support in the polls. She said this will give the government a popularity boost ahead of parliamentary elections, which are expected by the end of February 2016.
The International Monetary Fund has recommended a laundry list of reforms and overhauls to get the Croatian economy back on track. In November, it said it supported the idea of writing off debt for distressed households."

Minh Nguyen, 38, is known for helping launch Plaxo, an online address book and platform for quickly sharing and synchronizing contact details. The company was bought by Comcast (CMCSA) in 2008.
He was arrested Thursday night in Ashburn, Va., a suburb of Washington. Police there say he entered his ex-wife's home and shot Corey Mattison, the man she had just married. Two of Nguyen's children were in the townhouse at the time. Nguyen's ex-wife Denise was with their third child when she walked in on the gruesome scene.
None of the others in the home were hurt, according to Loudon County Sheriff's Office. Police arrested Nguyen without any resistance.
Nguyen's ex-wife, Denise, had just remarried in November, according to public notices online. Mattison was a project manager at a glass construction company in the Washington area.
Mattison's colleagues at the small company, who had gotten to know him well over the last eight years, said they were devastated by his death. They described Mattison as a calm listener who spent most of his weekends caring for all the children in his life. He had two elementary-school-aged children from a previous marriage and spent much of his time with his new wife Denise's three children as well.
""Corey was a great guy,"" said Rick Knutson, the firm's owner. ""He was someone we could depend on. He's the kind of person you just can't replace.""
Kuntson also said Mattison had privately voiced concerns over Nguyen's incessant interruptions during weekends with the kids.
""Corey and his wife would go to a baseball game with the kids, and [Nguyen] would blow up,"" Knutson said. ""He would try to prevent them from taking the kids anywhere. The guy seemed to be a little unstable.""
Nguyen is being held at the Loudon County Adult Detention Center without the option to be released on bond.
Since Plaxo was sold to Comcast, Nguyen had remained an active entrepreneur in San Francisco. He served as an adviser to several startups and regularly attended talks on robotics.

2015-02-17 03:03:54,"NSA spyware: Super-sneaky malware found in companies worldwide - Feb. 17, 2015 ",http://money.cnn.com/2015/02/17/technology/security/malware-nsa/index.html,"A shadowy hacking group has infected computers at companies, universities and governments worldwide with the sneakiest malware ever.
That's according to a report Monday by Internet security company Kaspersky, which described a hacking campaign ""that exceeds anything we have ever seen before."" The mysterious group, which researchers nicknamed ""the Equation group,"" uses malware that's unusually quiet, complex and powerful.
And in some cases, it planted spyware on computers' firmware, the programming that lives permanently on hardware. It's an unheard-of move that means the malware can avoid detection by antivirus software. Reinstalling a computer's operating system or reformatting the hard disk won't even fix the problem.
If you've got this, you might as well throw your computer away.
What's even more interesting is that Kaspersky's researchers say that the Equation group uses a hacking tool called ""GROK."" That's a tool used exclusively by the NSA's elite cyber-warfare unit, Tailored Access Operations, according to classified NSA documents released by former contractor Edward Snowden last year.
Kaspersky says the Equation group also appears to have ties to Stuxnet, the computer worm that sabotaged Iran's nuclear enrichment program in 2010 and was later revealed to be a joint U.S.-Israeli project.
The NSA declined to comment specifically on the Kaspersky report. But the agency noted that its efforts are focused on foiling terrorist plots from al-Qaeda and ISIS, stemming the flow of weapons of mass destruction and blocking aggression from foreign rivals.
""The U.S. government calls on our intelligence agencies to protect the United States, its citizens, and its allies,"" NSA said in a statement to CNN.
The Kaspersky report is the latest to depict a world engaged in constant cyber espionage. In the past, security firms have noted how Chinese hacker spies take business plans from power plants. Russian hackers break into oil and gas companies.
Kaspersky research director Costin Raiu said the Equation group hacked into hospitals in China; banks and aerospace companies in Iran; energy companies and government offices in Pakistan; and universities, military facilities and rocket science research institutions in Russia.
They attacked Iran the most, researchers said.
The Equation group also spied on Muslim scholars in the United States and the United Kingdom, Raiu said. It emerged last year that the NSA and FBI have been monitoring the emails of prominent Muslim-American lawyers and activists.
The group monitored keystrokes and stole documents from computers. In one instance in the Middle East, the hackers programmed the malware to specifically look for oil-related shipping contracts and inventory price lists.
Malware attacked Windows computers, Macs and even iPhones.
Unlike other hackers, however, the Equation Group wasn't interested in destroying computers or wiping them clean, the way North Koreans hurt Sony last year.
""They're interested in long-term intelligence gathering,"" Raiu said.
How far back does this go? Kaspersky researchers say the Equation group built some of its earliest malware in 2002, but the computer infrastructure used to spread the group's computer viruses dates back to 1996.
Their ability to stay quiet this long goes to show how talented they are, the Kaspersky report noted.

2015-01-21 08:27:50,"NBC to offer free online streaming of Super Bowl - Jan. 21, 2015 ",http://money.cnn.com/2015/01/21/media/super-bowl-nbc-stream/index.html,"NBC will allow viewers to watch 11 hours of Super Bowl coverage online for free, including the game and halftime show.
The amount of programming being streamed is more than has been made available in previous online offerings. NBC was first to stream the Super Bowl, in 2012.
NBC, which is a unit of the nation's largest cable operator Comcast (CMCSA), typically requires online viewers of its shows to prove that they have have a subscription with a pay television service (cable or satellite).
But by allowing online viewing of the most popular day of programing without proof of a subscription, NBC is hoping to encourage more viewers to sign up for cable service in the future in order to watch NBC programming both on cable and online.
Last year it unveiled an app called TV Everywhere to try to capture more online viewers, and it will be promoting that offering for viewers watching the game online.
The game will not be available for free on mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. Verizon (VZ, Tech30) has the mobile streaming rights to the game.
Online viewership of the game is still a tiny sliver of traditional television viewership. Last year it was viewed by about 528,000 viewers in the United States, a fraction of the 111.5 million who watched on television. But those half-million online viewers is more than many other broadcast shows will attract that day.

NFL football is the most popular programming on television, with the Super Bowl regularly the most viewed show of the year in the United States.
The growing number of viewers who get their entertainment online is a growing concern for pay television operators. Services like Netflix (NFLX, Tech30), Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) and Hulu all have entertainment programing and don't require viewers to have a paid television subscription. HBO, which like CNN a unit of Time Warner (TWC), will soon join them in offering a stand-alone service.
But it is difficult to watch live sports online without a cable or satellite subscription.
